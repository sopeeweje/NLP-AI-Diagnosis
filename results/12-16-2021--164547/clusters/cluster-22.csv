"IMPROVING THE HEALTH OF LATINOS Disparities in health and health care use between the Anglo (non-Latino white) population and African American populations receive considerable attention by state and national governments.  More recently, government and private providers recognized the disparities found among other ethnic groups in the United States.  The Latino population (i.e., Hispanics) receives increasing attention because of its rapid growth and increased social and political influence, especially in about a dozen major metropolitan areas in about 9 key states.  This conference is intended to highlight the major health services issues affecting the Latino population and provide information important for addressing these issues through state and federal initiatives.

"DEVELOPING A LATINO HEALTH AGENDA FOR 2010 The Hispanic Research Center at Arizona State University will sponsor a two an one-half days conference entitled: ""Developing a Latino Health Agenda for 2010: Call for Action"".  The purpose is to formulate a comprehensive national research and policy agenda of Latino health issues that will serve as the basis for a unified Latino health approach within selected Latino health research centers/institutions to help: a) strengthen Latino cultural and ethnic values that promote positive health behaviors, b) meet Healthy People 2010 objectives, and c) eliminate health disparities between Latinos and the general population.  These goals will be achieved by bringing together a selected group of Latino health researchers representing major Latino health research units, institutes and centers within universities to share ongoing research, vision, and policy initiatives of Latino health to eliminate health disparities in health services including access, quality/delivery, and in health outcome indicators.  In addition, this conference will provide a forum for brainstorming and developing action plans for a comprehensive Latino health advocacy, research, and policy agenda from the various players represented at the conference.  The Latino leading experts will have an opportunity to work interactively in the exchange of ideas and formulation of strategies related to research, advocacy, and policy.  To accomplish this task, this group will development a realistic and comprehensive plan that will serve as the basis for a unified Latino health approach in the areas of research, advocacy, and policy.  Formal activities for conference participants will include presentations by Latino health leading experts and interaction with the audience.  Latino health leading experts will introduce a platform of specific issues based on the agenda developed through the workshops.  In small group discussions, conference participants will react to this platform.  Finally, groups will report back to a plenary session to present a final plan of action.

"ARTHRITIS AMONG LATINOS:  A STUDY BASED ON NATIONAL DATA The broad aim of this study is to assist in uncovering factors underlying the observed differences between Latinos (Hispanics) and non-Latinos in the prevalence rate of arthritis and associated levels of disability.  This information can ultimately guide policy and intervention programs to reduce physical disability and promote health in this population.  According to recent national data, Latinos arthritis have a higher arthritis prevalence rate, but among those with arthritis, more Latinos than non-Latino whites report activity limitations (CDC, 1996a). Reasons for these differences are unknown, but may include disparities in sociodemographic factors, access to health care, and acculturation factors.  Therefore, the aims of the proposed study are to: (1) examine whether socioeconomic factors (e.g., income, education) and health insurance coverage account for differences in the prevalence of arthritis among Latinos and non-Latino whites, (2) document levels of disability, both in activities of daily living and inability to work, among Latinos and non-Latino whites with arthritis, and identify sociodemographic (e.g., income, education, type of occupation) and health care factors (e.g., lack of health insurance, quality of health care) that predict disability in the different groups; and examine whether health care factors explain the differences in disability levels of Latinos vs. non-Latino whites after controlling for sociodemographic variables, (3) examine the effects of nativity status (U.S. vs. foreign-born) and length of time in the U.S. (acculturation) on arthritis prevalence and disability. These issues will be examined using data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) on Disability, Phase I: Person and Condition Data, 1994.  The proposed study will control for age and SES differences between the various ethnic groups, and conduct detailed analyses by Latino groups.  This study will, therefore, contribute to a systematic program of research attempting to understand arthritis prevalence and disability among under-studied populations.

"UCLA/DREW/RAND PROGRAM TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN HEALTH To address disparities in health it is necessary to understand the factors that influence health care use and behavior, as well as health behaviors that occur in the context of receiving medical care. The UCLA/DREW/RAND Program to Address Disparities in Health tests an integrated model (based on the Anderson, Donabledean and Wagner models) to identify the most salient factors responsible for disparities and tests randomized interventions that address them.      Hypothesis to be tested focus upon aspects of this model. The Program focuses on the urgent need to improve the health outcomes of Blacks and Latinos in urban areas. The program includes 6 projects. Project 1 uses national data to assess the extent to which black/white infant mortality differences reflect differences in quality of neonatal intensive care. Project 2 uses 4 large data sets to determine the factors related to differential use of clinical preventive services by race and ethnicity and the extent to which certain factors differentially affect racial/ethnic groups. Project 3 studies the extent to which missed opportunities for diagnosis and differential treatment of the diagnosis are responsible for later stage at diagnosis and higher mortality from colon cancer among blacks, using a population based sample. Project 4 develops culturally appropriate tools for measuring quality of and satisfaction with care in a safety net population, and uses these tools to examines in this population. Project 5 evaluates the effectiveness of intervention to improve outcomes among Latino diabetics by improving their self-care. Project 6 studies the effectiveness of intervention to improve outcomes of blacks and Latinos with HIV disease through enhanced case management and adherence training. The four non-intervention projects will be used as the basis for subsequent development of additional intervention studies. Four cores (Administrative, Social Science, Data and Statistical Analysis, and Translation-Dissemination-Cultural Adaptation) will support the research effort. A major objective of the Program is to increase capacity for health services research on disparities among minority institution, which is one of the key partners in the Program Project. Subsequent resources have been allocated to developing Stakeholder-Investigator Partnerships to ensure maximal community input into the research as well as effective dissemination and translation of the findings into practice.

The lack of quality data      for Latinos and Asian Americans make it difficult to develop coherent public         policies needed to develop prevention and treatment programs appropriate for         these populations. The proposed research, the National Latino and Asian              American Study (NLAAS), aims to provide national information on the                  similarities and differences in mental illness and service use of Latinos and        Asian Americans, as compared to non-Latino whites and African Americans. The         NLAAS would be the most comprehensive study of Latinos and Asian Americans ever      conducted using up-to-date scientific strategies in the design, sampling             procedures, psychiatric assessments, and analytic techniques. The NLAAS              proposes to: (a) estimate the lifetime and 12 month prevalence of psychiatric        disorders and the rates of mental health services use for Latino and Asian           American populations; (b) estimate the association of social position,               environmental context, and psychosocial factors with mental disorders and            service use among Latinos and Asian Americans; and (c) compare the rates of          psychiatric disorders and utilization of mental health services of Latinos and       Asian Americans with national representative samples of non-Latino whites (from      the National Survey of Health and Stress; NSHS-R) and African Americans (from        the National Survey of African Americans; NSAA).

"UCLA/DREW/RAND PROGRAM TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN HEALTH To address disparities in health it is necessary to understand the factors that influence health care use and behavior, as well as health behaviors that occur in the context of receiving medical care. The UCLA/DREW/RAND Program to Address Disparities in Health tests an integrated model (based on the Anderson, Donabledean and Wagner models) to identify the most salient factors responsible for disparities and tests randomized interventions that address them.      Hypothesis to be tested focus upon aspects of this model. The Program focuses on the urgent need to improve the health outcomes of Blacks and Latinos in urban areas. The program includes 6 projects. Project 1 uses national data to assess the extent to which black/white infant mortality differences reflect differences in quality of neonatal intensive care. Project 2 uses 4 large data sets to determine the factors related to differential use of clinical preventive services by race and ethnicity and the extent to which certain factors differentially affect racial/ethnic groups. Project 3 studies the extent to which missed opportunities for diagnosis and differential treatment of the diagnosis are responsible for later stage at diagnosis and higher mortality from colon cancer among blacks, using a population based sample. Project 4 develops culturally appropriate tools for measuring quality of and satisfaction with care in a safety net population, and uses these tools to examines in this population. Project 5 evaluates the effectiveness of intervention to improve outcomes among Latino diabetics by improving their self-care. Project 6 studies the effectiveness of intervention to improve outcomes of blacks and Latinos with HIV disease through enhanced case management and adherence training. The four non-intervention projects will be used as the basis for subsequent development of additional intervention studies. Four cores (Administrative, Social Science, Data and Statistical Analysis, and Translation-Dissemination-Cultural Adaptation) will support the research effort. A major objective of the Program is to increase capacity for health services research on disparities among minority institution, which is one of the key partners in the Program Project. Subsequent resources have been allocated to developing Stakeholder-Investigator Partnerships to ensure maximal community input into the research as well as effective dissemination and translation of the findings into practice.

"Understanding ADHD in Low-Income Latino Children. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most research on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been conducted with sample groups of white, middle class boys living in suburban settings. Very few studies related to ADHD have been conducted with Latino children despite the fact that Latinos will soon be the largest ethnic minority group in this country. Research is needed to identify culturally sensitive, valid, and clinically useful methods for diagnosing ADHD and for assessing clinical characteristics such as impairment level and comorbidity patterns among Latino children. Theoretical frameworks specifically developed to take into account the unique cultural, historical, and socio-economic characteristics of most Latinos in this country would greatly facilitate research on Latino children with ADHD. The research aims of this project are (1) to determine the optimum number of symptoms from the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) needed for the diagnosis of ADHD in a sample of Latino and White children living in low income urban settings; (2) to determine the optimal cut off scores for Latino and White children with ADHD on the ADHD Rating Scale IV; (3) to determine whether Latino and White children living in low-income urban settings differ in comorbidity patterns for ADHD, Combined Type (ADHD/COM); (4) to explore the relationship between familism (a cultural value that involves strong identification with and attachment to members of nuclear and extended families), acculturation and level of impairment and comorbidity among Latino children. To test Aims (1) through (4), 100 teacher-referred Latino children, and 100 teacher-referred White children between the ages of 6 and 13 attending seven public schools in a low income area with predominantly Latino and White student population will be assessed. My goal for the next five years is to conduct independent research to investigate diagnostic and clinical issues arising in Latino children and families coping with ADHD. In order for me to become proficient in these areas, my mentors and I have developed an educational plan with four specific aims: 1. To become proficient in understanding the unique needs of Latino families coping with ADHD; 2. To develop knowledge and practical skills in the assessment of ADHD among Latino children; 3. To become knowledgeable about comorbid disorders among Latino children with ADHD; 4. To become more proficient in research design and statistics. In addition, I will receive training in the responsible conduct of research. In order to insure that all aspects of this research project are responsive to the values and needs of Latino families, I will assemble a stakeholder group composed of Latino parents, professionals, and paraprofessionals from the local Latino community. The completion of the proposed research and educational plans will enable me to become a skilled independent researcher and to develop empirically based, culturally sensitive assessment and intervention procedures for what is currently an under-served segment of children and families coping with ADHD.

"NATIONAL LATINO AND ASIAN AMERICAN STUDY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): As the profile of the U.S.          population dramatically changes, new data are necessary to support policy            decisions. Monitoring the mental health status of ethnic and racial minorities       is essential if actions to mitigate ethnic/racial disparities in health and          health care use are to be based on empirical findings. The lack of quality data      for Latinos and Asian Americans make it difficult to develop coherent public         policies needed to develop prevention and treatment programs appropriate for         these populations. The proposed research, the National Latino and Asian              American Study (NLAAS), aims to provide national information on the                  similarities and differences in mental illness and service use of Latinos and        Asian Americans, as compared to non-Latino whites and African Americans. The         NLAAS would be the most comprehensive study of Latinos and Asian Americans ever      conducted using up-to-date scientific strategies in the design, sampling             procedures, psychiatric assessments, and analytic techniques. The NLAAS              proposes to: (a) estimate the lifetime and 12 month prevalence of psychiatric        disorders and the rates of mental health services use for Latino and Asian           American populations; (b) estimate the association of social position,               environmental context, and psychosocial factors with mental disorders and            service use among Latinos and Asian Americans; and (c) compare the rates of          psychiatric disorders and utilization of mental health services of Latinos and       Asian Americans with national representative samples of non-Latino whites (from      the National Survey of Health and Stress; NSHS-R) and African Americans (from        the National Survey of African Americans; NSAA). To meet the aims, the               investigators will interview 4,000 Latino (Puerto Ricans, Mexican Americans,         Cubans, and Other Latinos) and 4,000 Asian American respondents (Chinese,           Vietnamese, Filipinos, and Other Asians) across the U.S. Data collection will        take place at the same time as the National Survey of Health and Stress              Replication and the National Survey of African Americans during the spring of        2001. Accordingly, we expect to be able to provide important baseline data for       Latinos and Asians that will be useful for examining whether the U.S. has            diminished mental health disparities by the year 2010 (Healthy People 2010).

"Physician Anti-tobacco Services for Latino Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino population is the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S. with an annual growth rate of over 2% a year, and an estimated one million combined documented and undocumented immigrants each year. Given this population growth, the rates of smoking among Latino adults and increasing smoking prevalence among adolescents may disproportionately contribute to significant tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and associated health care costs.  Physicians are increasingly seeing Latino patients during regular and emergent care visits.  However, little evidence exists that Latino patients, especially those with low English language proficiency (LEP), are benefiting from clinician-initiated interventions known to control and eliminate tobacco use.  And, more Latinos report problems with receiving sufficient care because of language difficulties than any other ethnic group.  As a behavioral psychologist with training in public health and  preventive medicine, and working in one of California's regions most populated with Latino persons, Stergios Tsai Roussos, Ph.D., M.P.H. is well positioned to extend and expand his training to address disparities in cancer prevention through physician-delivered tobacco control for Latino and LEP Latino populations.      Career Development: Activities include training in cancer prevention and control, advanced biostatistics, research design, and epidemiology, research methods in LEP and non-English speaking communities, clinician-initiated tobacco control, and Latino health issues.      Research Program: The goals of the research program are to better understand physician delivery of  tobacco control services (e.g., screening, counseling) to Latino and LEP Latino persons, and to identity and test the feasibility of an intervention to increase these cancer prevention services.  Two studies will be conducted.  Study 1 is a formative study, combining focus group and survey methods to determine modifiable factors that may affect physician tobacco control services to Latino patients in general and those with LEP.  Study 2 employs a prospective, multiple baseline design across two matched family practice residency clinics to test the efficacy of an intervention to increase physician's tobacco control with Latino patients.  These studies combined with training and career development will enable Dr. Roussos to develop and launch a fully independent career in cancer prevention among minority populations in the U.S. ",Physician Anti-tobacco Services for Latino Patients,6677529,K07CA102644,"['tobacco abuse education ', ' tobacco abuse prevention ', ' public health ', ' health care professional practice ', ' patient care personnel relations ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care personnel performance ', ' primary care physician ', ' human subject ', ' nonEnglish language ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' cancer prevention ', ' population survey ', ' group therapy ', ' Hispanic American ', ' counseling ', ' smoking cessation ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NCI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K07,2003,143370,0.12908936926636114
"Determinants of HIV Risk for Latino Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This study seeks to develop a theoretical explanation of the sexual risk behaviors of Latino youth from immigrant families, specifically Mexican American, Cuban American, and Puerto Rican adolescents using a nationally representative data set, Add Health. The findings of this study can improve by helping to identify at risk subpopulations for HIV infection, and second by helping to establish the salient predictors of behaviors for these subpopulations. There are four primary aims of this study.  Primary Aims of the Study:  1. Aim 1 will assess the impact of different types of assimilation experiences on the sexual risk behaviors of Latino youth as defined by a newly developed sociological theory Segmented Assimiliation.  2. Aim 2 will evaluate the relationships between ethnicity, race, assimilation experience, and the sexual risk behaviors of Latino youth.   3. Aim 3 will test mediating pathways (i.e. self-efficacy, knowledge) between the different acculturation types identified in Segmented Assimilation theory and the sexual risk behaviors of Latino youth.   4. Aim 4 will document the prevalence rates of sexual risk behaviors across different ethnic, racial, gender, SES, and age groupings and test the tenet of the Segmented Assimilation theory that immigrants are assimilating into different segments of American society. This study will use a combination of statistical methods and models including Iogit model for binary outcomes, the ordered Iogit model for ordinal outcome, the multinomial Iogit model for nominal outcomes, ZINB for count outcomes, and OLS for continuous outcomes. In cases where violations of OLS assumptions do not allow for BLUE a generalized linear model (GLM) will be used instead. The modified Bonferroni  procedure will be used to control for experimental error rates across multiple contrasts for variables with  more than one degree of freedom.

"Social Interactions and Activities of Latino ED Users DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Social interactions are significant to a myriad of phenomena, since many are dependent upon the development and maintenance of personal or social ties. With regard to help-seeking and health care utilization patterns during an illness episode, patients often consult with family, friends, community members, and others for advice (McKinlay, 1973; Pilisuk and Froland, 1978; Salloway and Dillon, 1973). Models of illness and help-seeking behavior attempt to explain how individuals recognize and respond to illnesses, but have struggled to find a balance between factors (indirect and direct) that are related to health care use and the underlying social processes that influence illness behaviors. The use of alternative methods of care or social interactions, which are equally important in understanding how and why individuals respond to an illness, are often not incorporated in dominant models of utilization. Increasingly, attention has been given to a dynamic framework that posits that help-seeking and decision-making processes are embedded in social interactions and activities among relevant actors (Uehara, 2001; Pescosolido, 1992). A recently developed model by Pescosolido, the Network-Episode Model (NEM), astutely states that health problems are part of a social process that is recognized, managed, and acted upon through contacts that the patient has in the community, within health care settings, or social service agencies (Pescosolido and Boyer, 1999).      This study applies the NEM model to examine the help-seeking behaviors of Latino adult emergency department users in New York City. Specifically, this dissertation will use a dynamic, help-seeking model to identify the social strategies or patterns of help-seeking that Latinos undertake immediately prior to an ED visit and examine the correlates of these strategies or patterns. In addition, the effect of the strategies or patterns and other selected variables on avoidable or unavoidable medical conditions among Latinos will be explored. This study is a secondary analysis of survey data from individuals who have visited one of four participating emergency departments (EDs) in New York City. In order to predict the determinants of the strategies or patterns ED patients use prior to going to the ED, a multinomial Iogit (MNL) will be used for analysis due to the complex nature of the dependent variable (i.e., multiple categories). In addition, logistic regression will be utilized to examine the predictors of avoidable or unavoidable ED use for Latino patients in this study. Identifying and investigating the underlying factors involved in ED use patterns will assist in the development and implementation of effective policy initiatives and interventions for many vulnerable populations in urban settings. Examining this issue in New York City provides a unique opportunity, as it has one of the largest and most diverse immigrant populations in the country and an extensive health care delivery system.

"Cultural Aspects of Latino Early Childhood Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity in the U.S. has reached a 20-25% prevalence. Latinos have higher rates of obesity across the lifespan, contributing to an ethnic disparity in rates of obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Obesity in childhood tracks into adulthood, making early childhood a key developmental time period for prevention. This study will use qualitative focus group methodology and freelisting to: (1) describe the characteristics Latino mothers use to identify and categorize infants as ""obese"" and ""overweight;"" (2) assess the kinds of behaviors, foods, feeding patterns, and other risks believed by Latino family members to contribute to early childhood obesity; (3) ascertain what Latino mothers and father would consider appropriate interventions for young children considered ""obese"" or ""overweight"" by health care professionals; (4) identify whom Latinos would consider appropriate persons to intervene in nutrition and activity issues for children; and (5) explore various program characteristics preferred by Latino families for a future obesity prevention program; and (6) identify differences among less- and more-acculturated Latino families regarding early childhood obesity issues, food and feeding practices, and intervention preferences. The study is a qualitatively-driven exploration of cultural dimensions of childhood obesity, cultural knowledge about what constitutes ""obesity"" and ""overweight,"" and the kinds of feeding and nutrition knowledge parents share about young children. Analysis of focus group data will identify cultural models of childhood obesity, cultural knowledge about feeding practices and other factors that contribute to childhood obesity, beliefs about healthful feeding practices, and avenues for intervention congruent with Latino families' preferences. Based on this pilot work, a culturally competent primary prevention program will be designed to prevent Latino early childhood obesity and overweight, and promote healthful nutrition and feeding.            ",Cultural Aspects of Latino Early Childhood Obesity,6666097,R03NR008496,"['body composition ', ' body weight ', ' obesity ', ' child (0-11) ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' maternal behavior ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' body physical activity ', ' human subject ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' dietary constituent ', ' nutrition related tag ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' population survey ', ' health behavior ', ' Hispanic American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' generation difference ', ' experimental design ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2003,76583,0.09987330323781513
"Infertility in Low-Income Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this qualitative, anthropological research is to examine the experiences of low-income Latinos of Mexican American and Central American descent who experience infertility. The specific aims are: 1) to examine the experience of infertility, including cultural meanings associated with gender and fertility, and cultural values about family and parenthood; 2) to examine access to the health care system for infertility treatment and use; 3) to explore the process of seeking and undergoing treatment for infertility; and 4) to examine the ways in which women and men seek to resolve fertility problems in the face of scarce resources, including efforts to become parents through non-medical means. The specific aims will be carried out by studying 120 women and 120 men who are their partners, age 21 and up, using qualitative methods. There will be three interviews at 6-month intervals: an initial couple interview will be followed six months later by solo interviews with each partner, and a final couple interview on year after the initial interview. In cases where it is not possible to include the male partner, women will be followed for all three interviews.   The sample will be drawn in approximately equal numbers from 1) the community itself, and 2) a low-income infertility clinic geographically situated within the community that serves this population. Qualitative analysis will be undertaken in a systematic progress of steps.

"Los Angeles Latino Eye Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous epidemiologic studies have provided estimates of the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract and age-related maculopathy in Blacks and Whites.  Unfortunately, no similar data exist for Latinos in the United States, the fastest growing racial/ethnic group and the largest minority in the 2000 census.  To help assess the needs for eye care, such data are crucial. The baseline Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) studied over 6000 adult Latinos (primarily Mexican-Americans) and determined that the profile of eye disease in Latinos is unique, with high prevalence rates of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (higher than Whites and Blacks) and glaucoma (higher than Whites but comparable to Blacks).  Prevalence rates for age-related maculopathy were found to be lower than those of Whites but higher than Blacks.  Furthermore, visual impairment, systemic disease and depression had a significant impact on self-reported vision-specific quality of life.  In these currently proposed studies, we will estimate the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract and age-related maculopathy in this well-characterized cohort. We plan to also measure the association of various risk factors with the incidence and progression of ocular disease.  Finally, in this proposed follow-up study, we will assess the impact of incidence and progression of ocular disease on vision-specific quality of life.  All Latinos who were examined previously in the baseline study will undergo an interview and a comprehensive examination, including measurement of visual acuity, refraction, visual field, intraocular pressure, fundus and optic disc photographs, hemoglobin a1c, and blood glucose.  Data from these examinations compared with those obtained at baseline, will allow us to determine the incidence and progression of ocular disease. The standardized study methodology and design will also allow us to compare these data with previously obtained estimates in Blacks and Whites.      The proposed study will provide the first estimates regarding the incidence, progression and risk factors associated with age-related eye diseases in Latinos.  The data will help predict the eye care needs of and will aid in developing prevention and intervention programs for this largest and fastest growing minority in the United States.

"Partnership to Reduce Asthma & Obesity in Latino Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Schools serving minority and low-income students suffer disproportionately from environmental hazards.  These hazards include poor indoor air quality and nutritionally poor food choices which contribute to increased rates of asthma-related conditions and obesity in these communities. A four year project is proposed. The Community Partnership for Healthy School Environments consists of community-based organizations, research scientists, and health care providers. Partners will identify specific school environmental health concerns in targeted Latino communities of Chicago through discussions, assessments, and audits. The communities will then guide the project's direction through their involvement in each step of data collection, development of interventions, and evaluation. By having an active role in the project's method and process, the communities will not only understand the importance of good school environmental health, but also gain the tools and resources to effectively address environmental stressors that will improve their overall quality of life.      The goal of this project is to reduce disparities of asthma-related illnesses and obesity in the quality of care, quality of life, and diagnoses of these conditions in Latino communities. The project has four aims:  1) develop a better understanding of the impact of the school environment, and a large school district's policies that influence this environment, on asthma and obesity; 2) develop a common language between 'professionals' and 'community members/parents' that will be used to activate, then resonate with school administrators; 3) evaluate two different models of community organizing in a school-based setting; and 4) open lines of communication and working partnerships between schools and community health providers.

"LATINO FAITH-BASED CANCER OUTREACH DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Latinos are the fastest growing underserved population in America and among the hardest-to-reach with information about cancer screening and treatment. PHTV will address this problem by determining the feasibility of conducting a faith-based outreach project using focus groups comprised of low-income Latino members of churches in the city with the largest concentration of Latinos in Ohio. The objective is to develop a video-based campaign to encourage screening and increase participation in clinical trials among low income Latinos, and increase the cultural competency of physicians. PHTV will identify and meet target group information needs with our proven culturally-specific production process that uses members of the target population to design messages. Three specific aims will accomplish this objective. First, PHTV will develop plans for a Spanish language television campaign that includes a screening program with Cleveland's Comprehensive Cancer Center and incorporates a web-based tracking system. Second, PHTV will plan for production of a video to increase Latino enrollment in cancer clinical trials.

"Latino Eye Health: A Communication Strategy for Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diabetes and diabetic eye disease are significant public health problems within the Latino community, and there is evidence for lack of knowledge and barriers to seeking appropriate eye care within this population.  Current eye health education efforts can be improved through development and dissemination of novel health communication strategies based on the Ideation Behavior Change model.  Among the basic principles of strategic design are   interdisciplinary approaches, Latino community participation, multiple channels for dissemination, and educational entertainment elements.  The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate an eye health communication strategy for Latinos with diabetes, in Baltimore MD.  The initial phase, formative research, will include 1: a household survey of Latinos in randomly selected block groups. The survey will cover knowledge, attitudes, and care seeking behaviors for diabetes and eye disease, sources of health information, and use of various media; 2: Focus groups comprised of key leaders, community members, and members of agencies working with the Latino community to provide input, and refine, the health communication strategy itself.  The Latino Eye Health Communication strategy will be based on models and principles of communication theory, especially community participation to enhance advocacy and build sustainability.  Components are envisioned to be radio spots, novellas, posters, mobile booths/show, and pamphlets with clear information on prevention of vision loss for Latinos with diabetes, and on access to eye care services. The evaluation of the Latino Eye Health Communication strategy will be two pronged: a repeat household survey to determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices after the introduction of the communication strategy. The second is a longitudinal study over three years of 250 Latinos with diabetes identified at a sentinel general medical clinic.  Change in eye care seeking behavior will be determined over the three years.  Improvements in eye care seeking behaviors should help in avoiding visual loss from diabetic retinopathy and macula edema, the leading causes of visual loss in the working age Latino population.         ",Latino Eye Health: A Communication Strategy for Diabetes,6826339,R01EY015900,"['edema ', ' diabetes mellitus ', ' diabetic retinopathy ', ' early diagnosis ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' diabetes education ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' eye disorder ', ' retina disorder ', ' eye disorder diagnosis ', ' patient care management ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' patient oriented research ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2004,729683,0.17919481753955807
"Promotion of Physical Activity in the Latino Community The San Diego Prevention Research Center (SDPRC) is an interdisciplinary academic-community partnership committed to conducting research and education in promoting physical activity (PA) and improving the health of Latinos. The community partner organization is the San Ysidro Health Clinic Inc., (SYHC), located near the San Diego/Tijuana border, and our Community Committee, of which the SYHC is a member, is the Enhancing Family Resources Collaborative (EFRC). The SDPRC comprises collaboration between a School of Public Health (SPH, San Diego State University; SDSU), a School of Medicine with a residency in Preventive Medicine (University of California at San Diego; UCSD), and a Department of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences (ENS; SDSU). Thus, training efforts will be readily accessible not only to practitioners but also to SPH and ENS graduate (masters and doctoral) and undergraduate students, and to UCSD preventive medicine residents. As a result of the training and education activities, the SDPRC will create a network of experienced professionals that will serve the needs of San Ysidro and other South Bay communities with respect to PA promotion, program evaluation, and community building. The core research activities we propose include conducting a community-wide needs and assets assessment for PA in San Ysidro, and developing and evaluating a community-wide walking initiative for adults and a soccer games/leagues enhancement program for children and adolescents. The SDPRC plans to create a PRC Latino Health Network as both a web- and meeting-based activity that will provide a forum for sharing strategies with the national PRC network to empower Latinos to reduce health disparities particular to their communities.

"Culture and Cancer: The CAse of Latino Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of this research are three-fold: 1) to identify aspects of culture associated with variations in breast and cervical cancer screening among Latino and Anglo women; 2) to develop psychometrically appropriate English- and Spanish language instruments to measure those cultural variables; and 3) to validate the instruments and test a theory-based hypothesis concerning the relations between culture and health behavior. The research is guided by an approach to the study of culture originally proposed by the P.I. and associates to investigate the role of culture in psychological functioning and behavior. The instruments to be developed are also expected to contribute to the long-term goal of developing a model that may effectively guide research and intervention concerning ethnic disparities in cancer screening and health behavior, in general, for Latino and other culturally diverse populations. Although the focus is on Latino women, Anglo women are included as a mainstream comparison group to satisfy methodological and practical requirements associated with the comparative study of culture. Participants will be recruited from the population of Latino and Anglo women living in San Bernardino, California, and surrounding counties in Region 5 of the California Statewide Cancer Reporting System. Three distinct methodologies will be utilized: First, the methods for the study of subjective culture will be used to identify specific aspects of culture relevant to cancer screening among Latino and Anglo women. Content analyses of open-ended interviews and focus groups will be performed to identify the relevant aspects of culture and to generate items for the instruments to be developed. Second, conventional psychometric procedures and statistical techniques will be applied to the development and validation of quantitative instruments to measure the cultural factors identified as relevant to cancer screening. Finally, survey methodology and multivariate quantitative methods of analyses will be used to test a hypothesis concerning the relationships among cultural factors, mediating psychological processes, and breast and cervical cancer screening in Latino and Anglo women.

"Understanding ADHD in Low-Income Latino Children. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most research on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been conducted with sample groups of white, middle class boys living in suburban settings. Very few studies related to ADHD have been conducted with Latino children despite the fact that Latinos will soon be the largest ethnic minority group in this country. Research is needed to identify culturally sensitive, valid, and clinically useful methods for diagnosing ADHD and for assessing clinical characteristics such as impairment level and comorbidity patterns among Latino children. Theoretical frameworks specifically developed to take into account the unique cultural, historical, and socio-economic characteristics of most Latinos in this country would greatly facilitate research on Latino children with ADHD. The research aims of this project are (1) to determine the optimum number of symptoms from the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) needed for the diagnosis of ADHD in a sample of Latino and White children living in low income urban settings; (2) to determine the optimal cut off scores for Latino and White children with ADHD on the ADHD Rating Scale IV; (3) to determine whether Latino and White children living in low-income urban settings differ in comorbidity patterns for ADHD, Combined Type (ADHD/COM); (4) to explore the relationship between familism (a cultural value that involves strong identification with and attachment to members of nuclear and extended families), acculturation and level of impairment and comorbidity among Latino children. To test Aims (1) through (4), 100 teacher-referred Latino children, and 100 teacher-referred White children between the ages of 6 and 13 attending seven public schools in a low income area with predominantly Latino and White student population will be assessed. My goal for the next five years is to conduct independent research to investigate diagnostic and clinical issues arising in Latino children and families coping with ADHD. In order for me to become proficient in these areas, my mentors and I have developed an educational plan with four specific aims: 1. To become proficient in understanding the unique needs of Latino families coping with ADHD; 2. To develop knowledge and practical skills in the assessment of ADHD among Latino children; 3. To become knowledgeable about comorbid disorders among Latino children with ADHD; 4. To become more proficient in research design and statistics. In addition, I will receive training in the responsible conduct of research. In order to insure that all aspects of this research project are responsive to the values and needs of Latino families, I will assemble a stakeholder group composed of Latino parents, professionals, and paraprofessionals from the local Latino community. The completion of the proposed research and educational plans will enable me to become a skilled independent researcher and to develop empirically based, culturally sensitive assessment and intervention procedures for what is currently an under-served segment of children and families coping with ADHD.

"Physician Anti-tobacco Services for Latino Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino population is the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S. with an annual growth rate of over 2% a year, and an estimated one million combined documented and undocumented immigrants each year. Given this population growth, the rates of smoking among Latino adults and increasing smoking prevalence among adolescents may disproportionately contribute to significant tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and associated health care costs.  Physicians are increasingly seeing Latino patients during regular and emergent care visits.  However, little evidence exists that Latino patients, especially those with low English language proficiency (LEP), are benefiting from clinician-initiated interventions known to control and eliminate tobacco use.  And, more Latinos report problems with receiving sufficient care because of language difficulties than any other ethnic group.  As a behavioral psychologist with training in public health and  preventive medicine, and working in one of California's regions most populated with Latino persons, Stergios Tsai Roussos, Ph.D., M.P.H. is well positioned to extend and expand his training to address disparities in cancer prevention through physician-delivered tobacco control for Latino and LEP Latino populations.      Career Development: Activities include training in cancer prevention and control, advanced biostatistics, research design, and epidemiology, research methods in LEP and non-English speaking communities, clinician-initiated tobacco control, and Latino health issues.      Research Program: The goals of the research program are to better understand physician delivery of  tobacco control services (e.g., screening, counseling) to Latino and LEP Latino persons, and to identity and test the feasibility of an intervention to increase these cancer prevention services.  Two studies will be conducted.  Study 1 is a formative study, combining focus group and survey methods to determine modifiable factors that may affect physician tobacco control services to Latino patients in general and those with LEP.  Study 2 employs a prospective, multiple baseline design across two matched family practice residency clinics to test the efficacy of an intervention to increase physician's tobacco control with Latino patients.  These studies combined with training and career development will enable Dr. Roussos to develop and launch a fully independent career in cancer prevention among minority populations in the U.S. ",Physician Anti-tobacco Services for Latino Patients,6801948,K07CA102644,"['tobacco abuse education ', ' tobacco abuse prevention ', ' public health ', ' health care professional practice ', ' patient care personnel relations ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care personnel performance ', ' primary care physician ', ' human subject ', ' nonEnglish language ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' cancer prevention ', ' population survey ', ' group therapy ', ' Hispanic American ', ' counseling ', ' smoking cessation ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NCI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K07,2004,143370,0.12908936926636114

"NATIONAL LATINO AND ASIAN AMERICAN STUDY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): As the profile of the U.S.          population dramatically changes, new data are necessary to support policy            decisions. Monitoring the mental health status of ethnic and racial minorities       is essential if actions to mitigate ethnic/racial disparities in health and          health care use are to be based on empirical findings. The lack of quality data      for Latinos and Asian Americans make it difficult to develop coherent public         policies needed to develop prevention and treatment programs appropriate for         these populations. The proposed research, the National Latino and Asian              American Study (NLAAS), aims to provide national information on the                  similarities and differences in mental illness and service use of Latinos and        Asian Americans, as compared to non-Latino whites and African Americans. The         NLAAS would be the most comprehensive study of Latinos and Asian Americans ever      conducted using up-to-date scientific strategies in the design, sampling             procedures, psychiatric assessments, and analytic techniques. The NLAAS              proposes to: (a) estimate the lifetime and 12 month prevalence of psychiatric        disorders and the rates of mental health services use for Latino and Asian           American populations; (b) estimate the association of social position,               environmental context, and psychosocial factors with mental disorders and            service use among Latinos and Asian Americans; and (c) compare the rates of          psychiatric disorders and utilization of mental health services of Latinos and       Asian Americans with national representative samples of non-Latino whites (from      the National Survey of Health and Stress; NSHS-R) and African Americans (from        the National Survey of African Americans; NSAA).

"Cultural Aspects of Latino Early Childhood Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Childhood obesity in the U.S. has reached a 20-25% prevalence. Latinos have higher rates of obesity across the lifespan, contributing to an ethnic disparity in rates of obesity-related morbidity and mortality. Obesity in childhood tracks into adulthood, making early childhood a key developmental time period for prevention. This study will use qualitative focus group methodology and freelisting to: (1) describe the characteristics Latino mothers use to identify and categorize infants as ""obese"" and ""overweight;"" (2) assess the kinds of behaviors, foods, feeding patterns, and other risks believed by Latino family members to contribute to early childhood obesity; (3) ascertain what Latino mothers and father would consider appropriate interventions for young children considered ""obese"" or ""overweight"" by health care professionals; (4) identify whom Latinos would consider appropriate persons to intervene in nutrition and activity issues for children; and (5) explore various program characteristics preferred by Latino families for a future obesity prevention program; and (6) identify differences among less- and more-acculturated Latino families regarding early childhood obesity issues, food and feeding practices, and intervention preferences. The study is a qualitatively-driven exploration of cultural dimensions of childhood obesity, cultural knowledge about what constitutes ""obesity"" and ""overweight,"" and the kinds of feeding and nutrition knowledge parents share about young children. Analysis of focus group data will identify cultural models of childhood obesity, cultural knowledge about feeding practices and other factors that contribute to childhood obesity, beliefs about healthful feeding practices, and avenues for intervention congruent with Latino families' preferences. Based on this pilot work, a culturally competent primary prevention program will be designed to prevent Latino early childhood obesity and overweight, and promote healthful nutrition and feeding.            ",Cultural Aspects of Latino Early Childhood Obesity,6787272,R03NR008496,"['body composition ', ' body weight ', ' obesity ', ' child (0-11) ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' family structure /dynamics ', ' maternal behavior ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' body physical activity ', ' human subject ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' dietary constituent ', ' nutrition related tag ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' population survey ', ' health behavior ', ' Hispanic American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' culture ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' generation difference ', ' experimental design ', ' health disparity ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R03,2004,77000,0.09987330323781513

"NATIONAL LATINO AND ASIAN AMERICAN STUDY DESCRIPTION (Adapted from Applicant's Abstract): As the profile of the U.S.          population dramatically changes, new data are necessary to support policy            decisions. Monitoring the mental health status of ethnic and racial minorities       is essential if actions to mitigate ethnic/racial disparities in health and          health care use are to be based on empirical findings. The lack of quality data      for Latinos and Asian Americans make it difficult to develop coherent public         policies needed to develop prevention and treatment programs appropriate for         these populations. The proposed research, the National Latino and Asian              American Study (NLAAS), aims to provide national information on the                  similarities and differences in mental illness and service use of Latinos and        Asian Americans, as compared to non-Latino whites and African Americans. The         NLAAS would be the most comprehensive study of Latinos and Asian Americans ever      conducted using up-to-date scientific strategies in the design, sampling             procedures, psychiatric assessments, and analytic techniques. The NLAAS              proposes to: (a) estimate the lifetime and 12 month prevalence of psychiatric        disorders and the rates of mental health services use for Latino and Asian           American populations; (b) estimate the association of social position,               environmental context, and psychosocial factors with mental disorders and            service use among Latinos and Asian Americans; and (c) compare the rates of          psychiatric disorders and utilization of mental health services of Latinos and       Asian Americans with national representative samples of non-Latino whites (from      the National Survey of Health and Stress; NSHS-R) and African Americans (from        the National Survey of African Americans; NSAA). To meet the aims, the               investigators will interview 4,000 Latino (Puerto Ricans, Mexican Americans,         Cubans, and Other Latinos) and 4,000 Asian American respondents (Chinese,           Vietnamese, Filipinos, and Other Asians) across the U.S. Data collection will        take place at the same time as the National Survey of Health and Stress              Replication and the National Survey of African Americans during the spring of        2001. Accordingly, we expect to be able to provide important baseline data for       Latinos and Asians that will be useful for examining whether the U.S. has            diminished mental health disparities by the year 2010 (Healthy People 2010).

"Latino Based Multimedia to Prevent NIHL    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most common occupational disease in the United States (NIOSH, 1996). This proposal addresses hearing health among the 1.4 million Latino (Hispanic) construction workers, a population that comprises 17 percent of the U.S. construction workforce (CPWR, 2002). In keeping with the major goal of Healthy People 2010 to eliminate disparities in health outcomes in minority populations and objective 28-18 to ""reduce adult hearing loss in the noise-exposed public"" (USDHHS, 2000), the project goal is to adapt, implement and evaluate a health communication intervention to prevent NIHL in Latino construction workers. Through testing of the Health Promotion Model (Pender, 1987) in previous studies, the Investigators identified the predictors of construction workers' use of hearing protection, designed Theory-based interventions to promote use of hearing protection, and derived the Predictors of Use of Hearing Protection Model (PUHPM). The proposed study will build on results of the PI's previous studies and uses innovative health communication technology to deliver the intervention in an individually tailored, interactive multimedia format. The purpose of this project is to adapt and evaluate an innovative, culturally specific, computer-based tailored (CBT), intervention to increase Latino construction workers' use of hearing protection equipment. In the PIs previous study, tailoring health messages to individual workers and delivering informational boosters were shown to be effective health communication strategies of improve workers' use of hearing protection, thereby ultimately reducing their risk of NIHL. Three specific aims will be addressed in this study: 1) assess the acceptability of a CBT intervention adapted for use with Latino construction workers with text and sound in equivalent Spanish and English versions; 2) evaluate the effect of the CBT intervention with and without a booster intervention on Latino construction workers' use of hearing protection equipment; and 3) test the PUHPM as an explanatory model of Latino construction workers' use of hearing protection by determining if changes in theoretically-specified variables are associated with changes in use of hearing protection.         ",Latino Based Multimedia to Prevent NIHL,6710364,R25DC005623,"['computer human interaction ', ' noise induced deafness ', ' computer assisted instruction ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' occupational health /safety ', ' occupational hazard ', ' health behavior ', ' Hispanic American ', ' culture ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' clinical research ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R25,2004,186940,0.040447925968414386
"Promoting Disaster and Terrorism Preparedness in Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 award is to allow David Eisenman, MD, MSHS to develop the skills to conduct community interventions for reducing disparities in health protection for terrorism and public health disasters among low-income Latinos of Mexican and Central-American descent. The award will provide an excellent transition from investigations Dr. Eisenman completed with Latino survivors of political violence and on racial/ethnic disparities in terrorism preparedness and response. The career development plan proposes mentored coursework, tutorials, and investigations to support learning in three core areas: (1) Health promotion research, (2) intervention design and analysis, and (3) terrorism and public health disasters.  Latinos are disproportionately affected by disasters and terrorism. The career development activities will be applied to studies developing and testing a narrowcast marketing campaign supplemented with a community health promoter educational outreach to promote preparedness (the intervention). Dr. Eisenman will perform a needs assessment study gathering formative data from community focus groups of low-income Latinos of Mexican and Central-American descent to understand their beliefs regarding preparedness activities, barriers, preferences and facilitators to adopting and sustaining activities, and the behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge that must be addressed in the intervention. The intervention will be devised and refined using participatory research methods and a second round of focus groups. The intervention will be fielded using a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent comparison group design to test its effects and a program valuation will be performed. Results will serve as data for an R01 proposal to more fully evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.  The specific aims of this study are (1) To examine the perceived needs of low income Latinos of Central American and Mexican descent for disaster and terrorism preparedness, and identify motivators and barriers to disaster preparedness; (2) to develop, distribute, and evaluate the intervention program, and (3) to test the effects of the intervention among low income, Latinos of Central American and Mexican descent.

"Infertility in Low-Income Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this qualitative, anthropological research is to examine the experiences of low-income Latinos of Mexican American and Central American descent who experience infertility. The specific aims are: 1) to examine the experience of infertility, including cultural meanings associated with gender and fertility, and cultural values about family and parenthood; 2) to examine access to the health care system for infertility treatment and use; 3) to explore the process of seeking and undergoing treatment for infertility; and 4) to examine the ways in which women and men seek to resolve fertility problems in the face of scarce resources, including efforts to become parents through non-medical means. The specific aims will be carried out by studying 120 women and 120 men who are their partners, age 21 and up, using qualitative methods. There will be three interviews at 6-month intervals: an initial couple interview will be followed six months later by solo interviews with each partner, and a final couple interview on year after the initial interview. In cases where it is not possible to include the male partner, women will be followed for all three interviews.   The sample will be drawn in approximately equal numbers from 1) the community itself, and 2) a low-income infertility clinic geographically situated within the community that serves this population. Qualitative analysis will be undertaken in a systematic progress of steps.

"UCLA/DREW/RAND PROGRAM TO ADDRESS DISPARITIES IN HEALTH To address disparities in health it is necessary to understand the factors that influence health care use and behavior, as well as health behaviors that occur in the context of receiving medical care. The UCLA/DREW/RAND Program to Address Disparities in Health tests an integrated model (based on the Anderson, Donabledean and Wagner models) to identify the most salient factors responsible for disparities and tests randomized interventions that address them.      Hypothesis to be tested focus upon aspects of this model. The Program focuses on the urgent need to improve the health outcomes of Blacks and Latinos in urban areas. The program includes 6 projects. Project 1 uses national data to assess the extent to which black/white infant mortality differences reflect differences in quality of neonatal intensive care. Project 2 uses 4 large data sets to determine the factors related to differential use of clinical preventive services by race and ethnicity and the extent to which certain factors differentially affect racial/ethnic groups. Project 3 studies the extent to which missed opportunities for diagnosis and differential treatment of the diagnosis are responsible for later stage at diagnosis and higher mortality from colon cancer among blacks, using a population based sample. Project 4 develops culturally appropriate tools for measuring quality of and satisfaction with care in a safety net population, and uses these tools to examines in this population. Project 5 evaluates the effectiveness of intervention to improve outcomes among Latino diabetics by improving their self-care. Project 6 studies the effectiveness of intervention to improve outcomes of blacks and Latinos with HIV disease through enhanced case management and adherence training. The four non-intervention projects will be used as the basis for subsequent development of additional intervention studies. Four cores (Administrative, Social Science, Data and Statistical Analysis, and Translation-Dissemination-Cultural Adaptation) will support the research effort. A major objective of the Program is to increase capacity for health services research on disparities among minority institution, which is one of the key partners in the Program Project. Subsequent resources have been allocated to developing Stakeholder-Investigator Partnerships to ensure maximal community input into the research as well as effective dissemination and translation of the findings into practice.

"Latino Eye Health: A Communication Strategy for Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diabetes and diabetic eye disease are significant public health problems within the Latino community, and there is evidence for lack of knowledge and barriers to seeking appropriate eye care within this population.  Current eye health education efforts can be improved through development and dissemination of novel health communication strategies based on the Ideation Behavior Change model.  Among the basic principles of strategic design are   interdisciplinary approaches, Latino community participation, multiple channels for dissemination, and educational entertainment elements.  The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate an eye health communication strategy for Latinos with diabetes, in Baltimore MD.  The initial phase, formative research, will include 1: a household survey of Latinos in randomly selected block groups. The survey will cover knowledge, attitudes, and care seeking behaviors for diabetes and eye disease, sources of health information, and use of various media; 2: Focus groups comprised of key leaders, community members, and members of agencies working with the Latino community to provide input, and refine, the health communication strategy itself.  The Latino Eye Health Communication strategy will be based on models and principles of communication theory, especially community participation to enhance advocacy and build sustainability.  Components are envisioned to be radio spots, novellas, posters, mobile booths/show, and pamphlets with clear information on prevention of vision loss for Latinos with diabetes, and on access to eye care services. The evaluation of the Latino Eye Health Communication strategy will be two pronged: a repeat household survey to determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices after the introduction of the communication strategy. The second is a longitudinal study over three years of 250 Latinos with diabetes identified at a sentinel general medical clinic.  Change in eye care seeking behavior will be determined over the three years.  Improvements in eye care seeking behaviors should help in avoiding visual loss from diabetic retinopathy and macula edema, the leading causes of visual loss in the working age Latino population.         ",Latino Eye Health: A Communication Strategy for Diabetes,6951124,R01EY015900,"['edema ', ' diabetes mellitus ', ' diabetic retinopathy ', ' early diagnosis ', ' disease /disorder proneness /risk ', ' diabetes education ', ' education evaluation /planning ', ' eye disorder ', ' retina disorder ', ' eye disorder diagnosis ', ' patient care management ', ' health care service utilization ', ' human subject ', ' information dissemination ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' health behavior ', ' Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' patient oriented research ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NEI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2005,521148,0.17919481753955807
"Partnership to Reduce Asthma & Obesity in Latino Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Schools serving minority and low-income students suffer disproportionately from environmental hazards.  These hazards include poor indoor air quality and nutritionally poor food choices which contribute to increased rates of asthma-related conditions and obesity in these communities. A four year project is proposed. The Community Partnership for Healthy School Environments consists of community-based organizations, research scientists, and health care providers. Partners will identify specific school environmental health concerns in targeted Latino communities of Chicago through discussions, assessments, and audits. The communities will then guide the project's direction through their involvement in each step of data collection, development of interventions, and evaluation. By having an active role in the project's method and process, the communities will not only understand the importance of good school environmental health, but also gain the tools and resources to effectively address environmental stressors that will improve their overall quality of life.      The goal of this project is to reduce disparities of asthma-related illnesses and obesity in the quality of care, quality of life, and diagnoses of these conditions in Latino communities. The project has four aims:  1) develop a better understanding of the impact of the school environment, and a large school district's policies that influence this environment, on asthma and obesity; 2) develop a common language between 'professionals' and 'community members/parents' that will be used to activate, then resonate with school administrators; 3) evaluate two different models of community organizing in a school-based setting; and 4) open lines of communication and working partnerships between schools and community health providers.

"Redes En Accion: National Latino Cancer Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Action is urgently needed to address persistent disparities in cancer control and prevention that harm the health of Latino populations.  To meet this need, we propose a comprehensive set of research, education, and training activities to be carried out at the national level and in regional centers in California, Florida, New York, and Texas by an established network of investigators uniquely qualified to understand issues from the perspectives of their diverse populations and to serve as leaders and role models for influencing change and fostering a new generation of Latino scientists and policy advocates.  Research activities will include: 1) development of disparity-related pilot projects for proposals to obtain independent NCI funding for Latino scientists; 2) national, regional, and local policy studies analyzing factors influencing disparities in access to cancer control and prevention, and the capacities of advocates concerned with this issue; and 3) multi-site evaluation of an experimental intervention designed to improve women's capacities for navigating health care systems that provide cancer screening and care.  Education activities at the national and regional levels will include:  1) multi-modal public education and outreach and 2) professional education and outreach for clinical providers and for organizations concerned with policies that influence access to cancer screening and care.  Training activities will consist of mentoring and pilot research support for students and junior scientists developing careers in research aimed at understanding and reducing disparities that affect the cancer health of Latinos.

"Physician Anti-tobacco Services for Latino Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino population is the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S. with an annual growth rate of over 2% a year, and an estimated one million combined documented and undocumented immigrants each year. Given this population growth, the rates of smoking among Latino adults and increasing smoking prevalence among adolescents may disproportionately contribute to significant tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and associated health care costs.  Physicians are increasingly seeing Latino patients during regular and emergent care visits.  However, little evidence exists that Latino patients, especially those with low English language proficiency (LEP), are benefiting from clinician-initiated interventions known to control and eliminate tobacco use.  And, more Latinos report problems with receiving sufficient care because of language difficulties than any other ethnic group.  As a behavioral psychologist with training in public health and  preventive medicine, and working in one of California's regions most populated with Latino persons, Stergios Tsai Roussos, Ph.D., M.P.H. is well positioned to extend and expand his training to address disparities in cancer prevention through physician-delivered tobacco control for Latino and LEP Latino populations.      Career Development: Activities include training in cancer prevention and control, advanced biostatistics, research design, and epidemiology, research methods in LEP and non-English speaking communities, clinician-initiated tobacco control, and Latino health issues.      Research Program: The goals of the research program are to better understand physician delivery of  tobacco control services (e.g., screening, counseling) to Latino and LEP Latino persons, and to identity and test the feasibility of an intervention to increase these cancer prevention services.  Two studies will be conducted.  Study 1 is a formative study, combining focus group and survey methods to determine modifiable factors that may affect physician tobacco control services to Latino patients in general and those with LEP.  Study 2 employs a prospective, multiple baseline design across two matched family practice residency clinics to test the efficacy of an intervention to increase physician's tobacco control with Latino patients.  These studies combined with training and career development will enable Dr. Roussos to develop and launch a fully independent career in cancer prevention among minority populations in the U.S. ",Physician Anti-tobacco Services for Latino Patients,6937728,K07CA102644,"['tobacco abuse education ', ' tobacco abuse prevention ', ' public health ', ' health care professional practice ', ' patient care personnel relations ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care personnel performance ', ' primary care physician ', ' human subject ', ' nonEnglish language ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' cancer prevention ', ' population survey ', ' group therapy ', ' Hispanic American ', ' counseling ', ' smoking cessation ', ' health care policy ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NCI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K07,2005,143370,0.12908936926636114
"Joining Forces with a Key Community to Reduce Obesity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of many common chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers. Evidence is accumulating that diet and physical activity are important for preventing obesity and protecting health. African-Americans, Latinos, and Pacific Islanders are more likely to experience high rates of obesity, lower levels of physical activity, and poor dietary habits than white communities.  Thus, obesity has emerged as a dominant and growing contributor to chronic disease disparities. Investigators from the UCLA School of Public Health have teamed up with the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS) to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework to select and pilot test an obesity control intervention among the staffs of health and social service agencies (including units within the health department and private community-based organizations [CBOs].  The DHS has long served in a convener role in addressing obesity in the community and has a staff of nearly 100,000, mostly African-American women and Latinos.  It also has relationships with and leverage to drive change in the many CBOs with which it collaborates to deliver health services; the demographic composition of these CBOs is also predominantly female and Latino or African-American.  Thus, the DHS is a perfect community partner in a CBPR effort to identify and test obesity prevention and control interventions.  The UCLA investigators have a long-standing commitment to conducting community based health disparities research.  This planning grant will provide crucial financial and institutional support to further develop and maintain the structures and communication channels necessary for an effective partnership between the academic research team, the health department, and other community agencies.  A Community Investigator Team, comprised of representatives from health and social services agencies and convened by DHS, will work closely with the research team to ensure that community input shapes each phase of the research process.  During the 3-year project period, a collaborative decision-making process will be utilized to identify, prioritize, and select obesity control intervention strategies. The project is innovative in its selection of these staff as the targeted ""community,"" and in its incorporation of evidence based decision-making algorithm into the intervention selection process. A pilot study that is both scientifically rigorous and acceptable to the community will test the intervention strategies.  Finally, the data from the pilot study will be analyzed and used to develop an R01 application. Results will also be disseminated among participating organizations.       This innovative community-based participatory research project will team UCLA researchers with local health department investigators to engage the staff of health and social services agencies in selecting and preliminarily testing obesity control interventions for their work settings.

"Promotion of Physical Activity in the Latino Community The San Diego Prevention Research Center (SDPRC) is an interdisciplinary academic-community partnership committed to conducting research and education in promoting physical activity (PA) and improving the health of Latinos. The community partner organization is the San Ysidro Health Clinic Inc., (SYHC), located near the San Diego/Tijuana border, and our Community Committee, of which the SYHC is a member, is the Enhancing Family Resources Collaborative (EFRC). The SDPRC comprises collaboration between a School of Public Health (SPH, San Diego State University; SDSU), a School of Medicine with a residency in Preventive Medicine (University of California at San Diego; UCSD), and a Department of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences (ENS; SDSU). Thus, training efforts will be readily accessible not only to practitioners but also to SPH and ENS graduate (masters and doctoral) and undergraduate students, and to UCSD preventive medicine residents. As a result of the training and education activities, the SDPRC will create a network of experienced professionals that will serve the needs of San Ysidro and other South Bay communities with respect to PA promotion, program evaluation, and community building. The core research activities we propose include conducting a community-wide needs and assets assessment for PA in San Ysidro, and developing and evaluating a community-wide walking initiative for adults and a soccer games/leagues enhancement program for children and adolescents.

The Network will be composed of health clinics and agencies serving Latinos including Denver Health Medical Center, the CU Health Sciences' Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Disease Prevention Division, and La Salud Health Clinics. The CFRLCN builds on previous work on cancer awareness, education and research activities in the Latino population like our SPN's five pilot projects. Future activities include efforts in awareness, prevention and early detection of breast, cervical, prostate, lung (including smoking cessation) and colorectal cancers.  Colorado Cancer Registry data has been used to target specific cancers for intervention in these 10 counties.  Education and prevention activities include Dia de la Mujer Latina, and a colorectal education/prevention outreach program.  The CFRLCN will reduce cancer health disparities in the 10 counties and will embark, in Years 1 and 2, on a community participatory research framework in intervention research to achieve these aims.  This work will lead to development of interventions and pilot proposals and large scale interventions (R01s).  Three plans address separately junior investigator training, health disparities community research, and education and prevention projects.  A separate pilot research proposal by Dr. Tim Byers (PI) will test sustainable navigation and support for the Hispanic cancer survivor.

"Los Angeles Latino Eye Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous epidemiologic studies have provided estimates of the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract and age-related maculopathy in Blacks and Whites.  Unfortunately, no similar data exist for Latinos in the United States, the fastest growing racial/ethnic group and the largest minority in the 2000 census.  To help assess the needs for eye care, such data are crucial. The baseline Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) studied over 6000 adult Latinos (primarily Mexican-Americans) and determined that the profile of eye disease in Latinos is unique, with high prevalence rates of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (higher than Whites and Blacks) and glaucoma (higher than Whites but comparable to Blacks).  Prevalence rates for age-related maculopathy were found to be lower than those of Whites but higher than Blacks.  Furthermore, visual impairment, systemic disease and depression had a significant impact on self-reported vision-specific quality of life.  In these currently proposed studies, we will estimate the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract and age-related maculopathy in this well-characterized cohort. We plan to also measure the association of various risk factors with the incidence and progression of ocular disease.  Finally, in this proposed follow-up study, we will assess the impact of incidence and progression of ocular disease on vision-specific quality of life.  All Latinos who were examined previously in the baseline study will undergo an interview and a comprehensive examination, including measurement of visual acuity, refraction, visual field, intraocular pressure, fundus and optic disc photographs, hemoglobin a1c, and blood glucose.  Data from these examinations compared with those obtained at baseline, will allow us to determine the incidence and progression of ocular disease. The standardized study methodology and design will also allow us to compare these data with previously obtained estimates in Blacks and Whites.

"Primary Care For Trauma-related Mental Health Problems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sub threshold PTSD present to primary care clinicians (PCCs) at rates similar to depression. The estimated lifetime prevalence of PTSD is 7.8% in the general population and is higher for underserved populations that are at greater risk for PTSD resulting from interpersonal, political, and community violence. Moreover, PTSD is poorly detected, under-treated, and debilitating. But, unlike the maturing field of depression in primary care with successful quality improvement interventions, little is known about effectively treating PTSD in this setting. We will employ a theory-based multi-level framework for guiding the first step in a program of research geared toward the development of primary care-based interventions for PTSD. We plan to follow with a full-scale effectiveness study application based on the results of this proposed work. We propose an exploratory study (R34) to better understand primary care trauma management and to identify promising strategies for improving the care of adult Latino immigrant patients suffering from PTSD and sub threshold PTSD. We will conduct this research in collaboration with the Clinical Directors Network, Inc. (CDN), a community-oriented practice-based research network that provides primary and preventive health care services for poor and underserved minority and immigrant populations. Specifically, we aim to:1. Describe primary care for PTSD and sub threshold PTSD from multiple stakeholder perspectives (medical directors, PCCs, and patients) among a sample of community/migrant health centers (C/MHCs) ranging in structural characteristics, and with a high proportion of Latino immigrant patients. 2. Identify structural and individual PCC predictors of PCC tendency to screen for, assess, refer, and manage PTSD and sub threshold PTSD. 3. Elucidate potential intervention strategies, based on data from Aims 1 and 2, to develop recommendations for viable strategies that could be tested in a follow-on study to improve primary care for PTSD and sub threshold PTSD. For Aim 1, we will conduct site visits and interviews with three types of key informants from a purposeful sample of five of the 57 C/MHCs that serve Latino immigrants and refugees in one CDN region that represent a range of clinical structures that might affect PTSD care (5 medical directors, 15 PCCs, and 4 patients with current PTSD matched to each of the 15 PCCs, N=60). For Aim 2, we will formally test hypotheses about predictors of variation in treatment for PTSD with a representative survey of a census of all 57 C/MHC directors and a random sample of 285 PCCs (5 per C/MHC). Aim 3 will use Aim 1 and 2 data and stakeholder meetings to identify potential interventions most likely to improve PTSD management and will culminate with a follow-on R01 application to implement and evaluate a promising intervention program for primary care-based treatment of PTSD and sub threshold PTSD in adult, Latino immigrants.

"Latino-White Differences in Self-Reported Health Status DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Self-reported health is a commonly used general measure of population health and is frequently used to illustrate health disparities between members of different racial and ethnic groups.  Although Latinos report ""fair"" or ""poor"" health at levels comparable to those of African Americans, other measures of health and functional status show they may have less need for health care, and their age-adjusted mortality rate is significantly lower than that of non-Latino whites.  The central hypothesis of this study is that acculturation level influences how Latinos report their health perceptions.  This study has three specific aims:  1) To measure the extent to which acculturation explains differences in self-assessed health between Latinos and non-Latino whites residing in California; 2) To measure the association of various indicators of acculturation with self-assessed health among Latinos and members of Latino subgroups; and 3) To evaluate the conceptual equivalence of self-reported health measures between Latinos and non-Latino whites, and among Latino subgroups.  The study will employ a cross-sectional design, using data from the 2001 California Health Interview Survey, which includes interviews from a geographically stratified random sample of nearly 11,000 Latinos and 26,000 non-Latino whites ages 18-64.  The first two aims will be addressed by using multivariate analysis to model self-assessed health as a function of demographic, SES, acculturation, access barriers, health conditions, and contextual SES factors, using the general health question, Physical Component Score, and Mental Component Score of the SF-12 as outcome measures.  The third aim will be explored using factor analysis of the SF-12 to compare these self-assessed health constructs for Latinos vs. non-Latino whites, and for disadvantaged persons vs. others.  This will be one of very few population-based studies to include measures of both acculturation and chronic health conditions in multivariate assessment of health status.  The findings will suggest whether self-reported health, as currently measured, is a valid indicator of health status or need for physical health services in a diverse population.

"Promoting Disaster and Terrorism Preparedness in Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 award is to allow David Eisenman, MD, MSHS to develop the skills to conduct community interventions for reducing disparities in health protection for terrorism and public health disasters among low-income Latinos of Mexican and Central-American descent. The award will provide an excellent transition from investigations Dr. Eisenman completed with Latino survivors of political violence and on racial/ethnic disparities in terrorism preparedness and response. The career development plan proposes mentored coursework, tutorials, and investigations to support learning in three core areas: (1) Health promotion research, (2) intervention design and analysis, and (3) terrorism and public health disasters.  Latinos are disproportionately affected by disasters and terrorism. The career development activities will be applied to studies developing and testing a narrowcast marketing campaign supplemented with a community health promoter educational outreach to promote preparedness (the intervention). Dr. Eisenman will perform a needs assessment study gathering formative data from community focus groups of low-income Latinos of Mexican and Central-American descent to understand their beliefs regarding preparedness activities, barriers, preferences and facilitators to adopting and sustaining activities, and the behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge that must be addressed in the intervention. The intervention will be devised and refined using participatory research methods and a second round of focus groups. The intervention will be fielded using a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent comparison group design to test its effects and a program valuation will be performed. Results will serve as data for an R01 proposal to more fully evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.  The specific aims of this study are (1) To examine the perceived needs of low income Latinos of Central American and Mexican descent for disaster and terrorism preparedness, and identify motivators and barriers to disaster preparedness; (2) to develop, distribute, and evaluate the intervention program, and (3) to test the effects of the intervention among low income, Latinos of Central American and Mexican descent.

"Advanced Center for Latino and MH Systems Research    DESCRIPTIONS (provided by applicant):       Center Core. There are pervasive ethnic and racial disparities in mental health service utilization and in mental health status yet the underlying causes of these disparities are poorly understood. This application seeks to establish an Advanced Center for Latino and Mental Health Systems Research (Advanced Latino Disparities Center) that focuses on understanding the factors affecting mental health service disparities in Latinos and generating research and knowledge to eliminate them. This Center will be part of the Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research (CMMHR) and is built on the strengths and learning experiences of our ongoing NIMH-funded Latino Research Program Project (LRPP). The proposed Center is a five-year project, structured around two large (R01) and two smaller (pilot) projects. We support the research with an Administrative and Methods Core led by experienced, multidisciplinary investigators, build on the collaborative partnerships that characterize our past work, and mentor and develop junior investigators to become new experts in health disparities research. The overall aims of the Advanced Latino Disparities Center are to: (1) Establish an administrative structure that supports a synergistic core of researchers to conduct mental health service disparities research; (2) Institute a methodological and statistical component as an integral part of the proposed program; (3) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary mental health services disparity research program with a focus on four program areas: (a) Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos; (b) Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos; (c) Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care; and (d) Dialog with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements; (4) Continue developing a cadre of young investigators committed to mental health service disparities research with Latino populations; and (5) Disseminate the research findings to inform policy decisions and practice, contribute to stakeholders' knowledge, and encourage future disparities research in Latino communities.      Project 1: Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos. The goal of this project is to develop and test a mixed methods approach to helping clinicians in public health psychiatric settings decrease clinical uncertainty by more accurately diagnosing patients with diverse cultural backgrounds and improving the matching of clinical services to the needs of Latinos. Our approach combines methods from cultural anthropology with statistical methods and psychiatric epidemiology. The specific aims of this study focus on generating improved cultural formulations and diagnostic accuracy using information from qualitative and quantitative perspectives, iterating between the methods in a complementary fashion. The specific aims are to: Aim 1: Identify the information about symptoms and cultural and social context gathered in the initial diagnostic interview, that clinicians use to make determinations about three disorders: major depression, drug abuse and alcohol abuse; Aim 2: Use data from an epidemiological survey to assess the potential sensitivity and specificity of the clinical determinations identified in Aim1 in detecting the underlying diagnosis. We will test the hypothesis that clinical diagnosis is less accurate for Latino than non-Latino white patients; Aim 3: Assess clinician and patient reactions to the recommended improvements to diagnostic assessments developed in Aim 2. Using focus groups and consensus panels, prioritize the kinds of information to be collected to improve diagnostic determinations in safety net settings. Aim 4: Apply the findings of Aim 3 to make concrete recommendations to improve the efficiency and fairness of diagnostic decisions for Latino and non-Latino white population groups.      Project 2: Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos. In this research we propose to conduct statistical analyses of data from a large quasi-experimental project (ACCESS) and a 2-stage modified Delphi technique to generate recommendations for the modification of assertive community treatment (ACT) when applied to Latino and other severely mentally ill homeless (SMIH) minority populations. The ACCESS study compared the outcome effects of ""augmented"" ACT (i.e., ACT + quality improvement intervention) and standard ACT, and found no evidence of differences. Utilizing a disparities framework, advanced statistical methods, and a 2-stage Delphi method, we propose to conduct service and outcomes disparities research aimed at generating information with clinical or programmatic utility for Latinos. The proposed analyses will generate new evidence on service use and outcomes for Latino SMIH persons treated with ACT, and will broaden our understanding of the effects of quality improvement interventions for   Latinos. Findings will be integrated with expert opinion to generate recommendations regarding ACT for Latino SMIH persons.   The study has four aims:   1. To test for disparities in service use for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   2. To test for outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   3. To estimate the impact of observed service disparities on observed outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons   4. To integrate results from analyses of service and outcome disparities for Latinos, a literature review, and expert opinion, and generate recommendations to improve ACT for Latino SMIH persons.      Pilot 1: Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care. Parental belief that the child needs mental health care has been found to be the most significant factor associated with service use in non-minority populations. The results of several studies suggest that Latino parents are less likely than European Americans to recognize and/or label their children's behavior as a mental health problem requiring intervention. It is not clear which factors explain this lower recognition of mental health problems by Latino parents, and consequently the lower utilization of mental health services by this group. Differences between providers and parents in their views of children's impairments and/or the kind of problems that require treatment may also explain some of the lower utilization of mental health services among Latino children. There is some evidence that providers from different cultures differ in their impairment ratings of children. However, there is no research that examines whether non-Latino white providers as compared to Latino providers are more likely to rate the same children as impaired, nor is there any research that assesses the extent to which parents and providers from different cultures differ in their ratings of children's impairment. This pilot aims to investigate parental and provider beliefs about what is impaired behavior, the severity of the behavior, and the need for treatment in a sample of Mexican Americans, island Puerto Rican and non-Latino providers and parents. We will examine the ratings of providers and parents from the three ethnic groups using case vignettes of children with different levels of impairment and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Vignettes will be developed utilizing information obtained through secondary analyses of two clinical data sets. We will test the hypothesis that Puerto Rican and Mexican American parents and providers rate the children described in the vignettes as less impaired as compared to non-Latino white parents and providers. We further hypothesize that greater acculturation in Mexican American parents will be associated with less variation between Mexican American and non- Latino white parents in their impairment ratings of the vignettes. We also expect greater congruence in the impairment ratings and perceptions of need for services among parents and providers within the same ethnic group.      Pilot 2: Dialogue with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements. A disproportionate number of Latinos rely on free or reduced price care making them more vulnerable to the impact of shrinking resources on the quality of care at safety net healthcare systems. The main goal of this pilot is to identify quality improvements by increasing the Latino community voice in a safety net mental healthcare system. We will explore system concerns (disproportionate impact of economic constraints on quality of care and low levels of participation in mental health services among Latinos) by including members of the Latino community in a participatory research process together with representatives of a healthcare system (i.e., psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, senior hospital administrators, clinic coordinators). In addition, this resulting collaborative stakeholder group will jointly identify leverage points in the community and health care system to launch quality improvements.    The aims of the pilot are to:   1. Consult multiple stakeholders to identify community, client, administrative, provider and mental health care system barriers to access and quality mental health services for Latino patients.   2. Selecting barriers identified from Aim 1, conduct policy implementation analyses that ground the participatory process in a clear, shared understanding of the legal, administrative and fiscal constraints on efforts aimed at quality improvements.   3. Use the information generated in Aims 1 and 2 to launch a participatory process with multiple stakeholders to identify leverage points for mental health care system change. As part of this research, we will generate hypotheses to be tested in the context of community and/or systems interventions and their prospective evaluation in R01 applications.   We intend to use qualitative methods and policy implementation analysis to address these aims. We will build a collaborative, multidisciplinary community and mental health systems advisory group to assist in the identification and design of these quality improvements. By the end of this pilot, we will have a sustainable group of advisors who will work together in the future implementation of the quality improvements identified through this pilot work.      Center Core:         ",Advanced Center for Latino and MH Systems Research,6895298,P50MH073469,[''],NIMH,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,P50,2005,921689,0.11234412173972488
"Understanding ADHD in Low-Income Latino Children. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most research on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been conducted with sample groups of white, middle class boys living in suburban settings. Very few studies related to ADHD have been conducted with Latino children despite the fact that Latinos will soon be the largest ethnic minority group in this country. Research is needed to identify culturally sensitive, valid, and clinically useful methods for diagnosing ADHD and for assessing clinical characteristics such as impairment level and comorbidity patterns among Latino children. Theoretical frameworks specifically developed to take into account the unique cultural, historical, and socio-economic characteristics of most Latinos in this country would greatly facilitate research on Latino children with ADHD. The research aims of this project are (1) to determine the optimum number of symptoms from the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) needed for the diagnosis of ADHD in a sample of Latino and White children living in low income urban settings; (2) to determine the optimal cut off scores for Latino and White children with ADHD on the ADHD Rating Scale IV; (3) to determine whether Latino and White children living in low-income urban settings differ in comorbidity patterns for ADHD, Combined Type (ADHD/COM); (4) to explore the relationship between familism (a cultural value that involves strong identification with and attachment to members of nuclear and extended families), acculturation and level of impairment and comorbidity among Latino children. To test Aims (1) through (4), 100 teacher-referred Latino children, and 100 teacher-referred White children between the ages of 6 and 13 attending seven public schools in a low income area with predominantly Latino and White student population will be assessed. My goal for the next five years is to conduct independent research to investigate diagnostic and clinical issues arising in Latino children and families coping with ADHD. In order for me to become proficient in these areas, my mentors and I have developed an educational plan with four specific aims: 1. To become proficient in understanding the unique needs of Latino families coping with ADHD; 2. To develop knowledge and practical skills in the assessment of ADHD among Latino children; 3. To become knowledgeable about comorbid disorders among Latino children with ADHD; 4. To become more proficient in research design and statistics. In addition, I will receive training in the responsible conduct of research. In order to insure that all aspects of this research project are responsive to the values and needs of Latino families, I will assemble a stakeholder group composed of Latino parents, professionals, and paraprofessionals from the local Latino community. The completion of the proposed research and educational plans will enable me to become a skilled independent researcher and to develop empirically based, culturally sensitive assessment and intervention procedures for what is currently an under-served segment of children and families coping with ADHD.

"Culture and Cancer: The CAse of Latino Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The aims of this research are three-fold: 1) to identify aspects of culture associated with variations in breast and cervical cancer screening among Latino and Anglo women; 2) to develop psychometrically appropriate English- and Spanish language instruments to measure those cultural variables; and 3) to validate the instruments and test a theory-based hypothesis concerning the relations between culture and health behavior. The research is guided by an approach to the study of culture originally proposed by the P.I. and associates to investigate the role of culture in psychological functioning and behavior. The instruments to be developed are also expected to contribute to the long-term goal of developing a model that may effectively guide research and intervention concerning ethnic disparities in cancer screening and health behavior, in general, for Latino and other culturally diverse populations. Although the focus is on Latino women, Anglo women are included as a mainstream comparison group to satisfy methodological and practical requirements associated with the comparative study of culture. Participants will be recruited from the population of Latino and Anglo women living in San Bernardino, California, and surrounding counties in Region 5 of the California Statewide Cancer Reporting System. Three distinct methodologies will be utilized: First, the methods for the study of subjective culture will be used to identify specific aspects of culture relevant to cancer screening among Latino and Anglo women. Content analyses of open-ended interviews and focus groups will be performed to identify the relevant aspects of culture and to generate items for the instruments to be developed. Second, conventional psychometric procedures and statistical techniques will be applied to the development and validation of quantitative instruments to measure the cultural factors identified as relevant to cancer screening. Finally, survey methodology and multivariate quantitative methods of analyses will be used to test a hypothesis concerning the relationships among cultural factors, mediating psychological processes, and breast and cervical cancer screening in Latino and Anglo women.

"Latin American Cancer Research Coalition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   There are approximately 36 million Latinos known to be living in the US and by the year 2050, this group will constitute 25 percent of the US population.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death among this rapidly growing minority group.  Latinos have higher rates of cancers with infectious etiologies.  For other sites, despite lower incidence, Latinos have more late stage, higher mortality-to-incidence ratios, and inferior survival compared to Caucasians.  Lifestyle changes associated with acculturation may also increase future cancer risks.  The greater Washington-Baltimore tri-state region (DC, Maryland, Virginia) has one of the largest urban concentrations of Latinos in the US. Latinos in this region are predominately of Central and South American ancestry, recently immigrated, un-insured, and largely monolingual.  We developed the Latin American Cancer Research Coalition (LACRC) as a local network in DC to address the unique needs of this Latino subgroup.  In our first 4 years, the LACRC trained community coordinators, students, and faculty, submitted an R25T post-doctoral grant, obtained pilot and career development funding, published manuscripts, and disseminated results with the community.  We propose to expand the LACRC as a regional network.  The overarching goal of this regional network is to document, understand, and reduce cancer disparities in Latinos.  LACRC partners include multidisciplinary, multicultural, and bilingual researchers and staff from the Washington Hospital Center/Cancer Institute, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown university, 19 community safety net clinics across our region, the Inova-Fairfax community hospital, and consultants and advisors from the regional Departments of Health and Tumor Registries, the Council of Latino Agencies, the National Council of La Raza, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the regional NCI Cancer Information Service and Spanish-language support line, the ACS, and others.  LACRC aims are to:  1) enhance capacity, especially for data collection on Latinos; 2) use the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to guide participatory research and use results to inform education, training, and planning; and 3) obtain funding, influence policy, and evaluate progress.  The structure of the LACRC is ideally suited as a platform for bridging the gaps between research discovery and delivery, and developing, evaluating, and disseminating culturally competent interventions across the spectrum of cancer control.  Our approach should be broadly portable to reducing disparities in other US urban Latino communities         ",Latin American Cancer Research Coalition,6924363,U01CA114593,"['cooperative study ', ' early diagnosis ', ' neoplasm /cancer education ', ' training ', ' community health service ', ' human subject ', ' neoplasm /cancer diagnosis ', ' cancer prevention ', ' neoplasm /cancer therapy ', ' Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2005,799618,0.1537713908872325
"Latino Based Multimedia to Prevent NIHL    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most common occupational disease in the United States (NIOSH, 1996). This proposal addresses hearing health among the 1.4 million Latino (Hispanic) construction workers, a population that comprises 17 percent of the U.S. construction workforce (CPWR, 2002). In keeping with the major goal of Healthy People 2010 to eliminate disparities in health outcomes in minority populations and objective 28-18 to ""reduce adult hearing loss in the noise-exposed public"" (USDHHS, 2000), the project goal is to adapt, implement and evaluate a health communication intervention to prevent NIHL in Latino construction workers. Through testing of the Health Promotion Model (Pender, 1987) in previous studies, the Investigators identified the predictors of construction workers' use of hearing protection, designed Theory-based interventions to promote use of hearing protection, and derived the Predictors of Use of Hearing Protection Model (PUHPM). The proposed study will build on results of the PI's previous studies and uses innovative health communication technology to deliver the intervention in an individually tailored, interactive multimedia format. The purpose of this project is to adapt and evaluate an innovative, culturally specific, computer-based tailored (CBT), intervention to increase Latino construction workers' use of hearing protection equipment. In the PIs previous study, tailoring health messages to individual workers and delivering informational boosters were shown to be effective health communication strategies of improve workers' use of hearing protection, thereby ultimately reducing their risk of NIHL. Three specific aims will be addressed in this study: 1) assess the acceptability of a CBT intervention adapted for use with Latino construction workers with text and sound in equivalent Spanish and English versions; 2) evaluate the effect of the CBT intervention with and without a booster intervention on Latino construction workers' use of hearing protection equipment; and 3) test the PUHPM as an explanatory model of Latino construction workers' use of hearing protection by determining if changes in theoretically-specified variables are associated with changes in use of hearing protection.         ",Latino Based Multimedia to Prevent NIHL,6877197,R25DC005623,"['computer human interaction ', ' noise induced deafness ', ' computer assisted instruction ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' occupational health /safety ', ' occupational hazard ', ' health behavior ', ' Hispanic American ', ' culture ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' clinical research ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R25,2005,177215,0.040447925968414386
"Los Angeles Latino Eye Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous epidemiologic studies have provided estimates of the incidence of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract and age-related maculopathy in Blacks and Whites.  Unfortunately, no similar data exist for Latinos in the United States, the fastest growing racial/ethnic group and the largest minority in the 2000 census.  To help assess the needs for eye care, such data are crucial. The baseline Los Angeles Latino Eye Study (LALES) studied over 6000 adult Latinos (primarily Mexican-Americans) and determined that the profile of eye disease in Latinos is unique, with high prevalence rates of diabetes, diabetic retinopathy (higher than Whites and Blacks) and glaucoma (higher than Whites but comparable to Blacks).  Prevalence rates for age-related maculopathy were found to be lower than those of Whites but higher than Blacks.  Furthermore, visual impairment, systemic disease and depression had a significant impact on self-reported vision-specific quality of life.  In these currently proposed studies, we will estimate the incidence and progression of diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract and age-related maculopathy in this well-characterized cohort. We plan to also measure the association of various risk factors with the incidence and progression of ocular disease.  Finally, in this proposed follow-up study, we will assess the impact of incidence and progression of ocular disease on vision-specific quality of life.  All Latinos who were examined previously in the baseline study will undergo an interview and a comprehensive examination, including measurement of visual acuity, refraction, visual field, intraocular pressure, fundus and optic disc photographs, hemoglobin a1c, and blood glucose.  Data from these examinations compared with those obtained at baseline, will allow us to determine the incidence and progression of ocular disease. The standardized study methodology and design will also allow us to compare these data with previously obtained estimates in Blacks and Whites.      The proposed study will provide the first estimates regarding the incidence, progression and risk factors associated with age-related eye diseases in Latinos.  The data will help predict the eye care needs of and will aid in developing prevention and intervention programs for this largest and fastest growing minority in the United States.

"Behavior & Clinical Trials Participation in HIV+ Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through this research career development award, I will complete the initial steps to establish myself as an independent researcher in HIV/AIDS behavioral research to reduce health disparities in Latino communities infected with HIV. Using didactic and mentored learning, I will improve upon my existing behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative research skills to address the issue of low participation in HIV/AIDS clinical trials in Latino communities. Proportionate representation of minority populations in research trials is necessary to improve research capacity to generalize results to diverse populations infected with HIV. My specific research aims are to: 1) Describe and understand the attitudes, beliefs, cultural and social norms, provider and system influences relating to entry into clinical trials in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and 2) Develop and pilot test an intervention for improving understanding and acceptance of HIV clinical trials participation by HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos and their communities. The theoretical framework of the research plan is the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (Andersen, Aday, et al.). The research plan will be carried out in three phases, each phase linked to a career development objective and activity. In Phase 1 I will conduct formative research using qualitative methods with HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, including design and implementation of an in-depth interview protocol and focus group questions to explore factors to consider in attempting to improve clinical trials participation in Latino populations. In Phase 2 I will carry out qualitative analysis, develop a social cognitive model of participation in research, develop research hypotheses, and develop and pilot test a survey to test the social cognitive model in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos. In Phase 3 I will validate the survey, analyze and report outcomes, design and pilot-test a behavioral intervention to increase clinical trials participation in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and finally, use intervention pilot data to prepare an R01 proposal to the NIH to promote participation of HIV+ Latinos in clinical trials.

"Physician Anti-tobacco Services for Latino Patients DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino population is the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S. with an annual growth rate of over 2% a year, and an estimated one million combined documented and undocumented immigrants each year. Given this population growth, the rates of smoking among Latino adults and increasing smoking prevalence among adolescents may disproportionately contribute to significant tobacco-related morbidity and mortality and associated health care costs.  Physicians are increasingly seeing Latino patients during regular and emergent care visits.  However, little evidence exists that Latino patients, especially those with low English language proficiency (LEP), are benefiting from clinician-initiated interventions known to control and eliminate tobacco use.  And, more Latinos report problems with receiving sufficient care because of language difficulties than any other ethnic group.  As a behavioral psychologist with training in public health and  preventive medicine, and working in one of California's regions most populated with Latino persons, Stergios Tsai Roussos, Ph.D., M.P.H. is well positioned to extend and expand his training to address disparities in cancer prevention through physician-delivered tobacco control for Latino and LEP Latino populations.      Career Development: Activities include training in cancer prevention and control, advanced biostatistics, research design, and epidemiology, research methods in LEP and non-English speaking communities, clinician-initiated tobacco control, and Latino health issues.      Research Program: The goals of the research program are to better understand physician delivery of  tobacco control services (e.g., screening, counseling) to Latino and LEP Latino persons, and to identity and test the feasibility of an intervention to increase these cancer prevention services.  Two studies will be conducted.  Study 1 is a formative study, combining focus group and survey methods to determine modifiable factors that may affect physician tobacco control services to Latino patients in general and those with LEP.  Study 2 employs a prospective, multiple baseline design across two matched family practice residency clinics to test the efficacy of an intervention to increase physician's tobacco control with Latino patients.  These studies combined with training and career development will enable Dr. Roussos to develop and launch a fully independent career in cancer prevention among minority populations in the U.S. ",Physician Anti-tobacco Services for Latino Patients,7101885,K07CA102644,"['focus groups ', ' health services research tag ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' clinical research ', ' health care policy ', ' smoking cessation ', ' counseling ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' group therapy ', ' population survey ', ' cancer prevention ', ' data collection methodology /evaluation ', ' nonEnglish language ', ' human subject ', ' primary care physician ', ' health care personnel performance ', ' health care service availability ', ' patient care personnel relations ', ' health care professional practice ', ' public health ', ' tobacco abuse prevention ', ' tobacco abuse education ', ' ']",NCI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,K07,2006,143370,0.12908936926636114
"Joining Forces with a Key Community to Reduce Obesity D*    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of many common chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers. Evidence is accumulating that diet and physical activity are important for preventing obesity and protecting health. African-Americans, Latinos, and Pacific Islanders are more likely to experience high rates of obesity, lower levels of physical activity, and poor dietary habits than white communities.  Thus, obesity has emerged as a dominant and growing contributor to chronic disease disparities. Investigators from the UCLA School of Public Health have teamed up with the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS) to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework to select and pilot test an obesity control intervention among the staffs of health and social service agencies (including units within the health department and private community-based organizations [CBOs].  The DHS has long served in a convener role in addressing obesity in the community and has a staff of nearly 100,000, mostly African-American women and Latinos.  It also has relationships with and leverage to drive change in the many CBOs with which it collaborates to deliver health services; the demographic composition of these CBOs is also predominantly female and Latino or African-American.  Thus, the DHS is a perfect community partner in a CBPR effort to identify and test obesity prevention and control interventions.  The UCLA investigators have a long-standing commitment to conducting community based health disparities research.  This planning grant will provide crucial financial and institutional support to further develop and maintain the structures and communication channels necessary for an effective partnership between the academic research team, the health department, and other community agencies.  A Community Investigator Team, comprised of representatives from health and social services agencies and convened by DHS, will work closely with the research team to ensure that community input shapes each phase of the research process.  During the 3-year project period, a collaborative decision-making process will be utilized to identify, prioritize, and select obesity control intervention strategies. The project is innovative in its selection of these staff as the targeted ""community,"" and in its incorporation of evidence based decision-making algorithm into the intervention selection process. A pilot study that is both scientifically rigorous and acceptable to the community will test the intervention strategies.  Finally, the data from the pilot study will be analyzed and used to develop an R01 application. Results will also be disseminated among participating organizations.       This innovative community-based participatory research project will team UCLA researchers with local health department investigators to engage the staff of health and social services agencies in selecting and preliminarily testing obesity control interventions for their work settings.

"Latino Eye Health: A Communication Strategy for Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diabetes and diabetic eye disease are significant public health problems within the Latino community, and there is evidence for lack of knowledge and barriers to seeking appropriate eye care within this population.  Current eye health education efforts can be improved through development and dissemination of novel health communication strategies based on the Ideation Behavior Change model.  Among the basic principles of strategic design are   interdisciplinary approaches, Latino community participation, multiple channels for dissemination, and educational entertainment elements.  The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate an eye health communication strategy for Latinos with diabetes, in Baltimore MD.  The initial phase, formative research, will include 1: a household survey of Latinos in randomly selected block groups. The survey will cover knowledge, attitudes, and care seeking behaviors for diabetes and eye disease, sources of health information, and use of various media; 2: Focus groups comprised of key leaders, community members, and members of agencies working with the Latino community to provide input, and refine, the health communication strategy itself.  The Latino Eye Health Communication strategy will be based on models and principles of communication theory, especially community participation to enhance advocacy and build sustainability.  Components are envisioned to be radio spots, novellas, posters, mobile booths/show, and pamphlets with clear information on prevention of vision loss for Latinos with diabetes, and on access to eye care services. The evaluation of the Latino Eye Health Communication strategy will be two pronged: a repeat household survey to determine knowledge, attitudes, and practices after the introduction of the communication strategy. The second is a longitudinal study over three years of 250 Latinos with diabetes identified at a sentinel general medical clinic.  Change in eye care seeking behavior will be determined over the three years.

"Partnership to Reduce Asthma & Obesity in Latino Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Schools serving minority and low-income students suffer disproportionately from environmental hazards.  These hazards include poor indoor air quality and nutritionally poor food choices which contribute to increased rates of asthma-related conditions and obesity in these communities. A four year project is proposed. The Community Partnership for Healthy School Environments consists of community-based organizations, research scientists, and health care providers. Partners will identify specific school environmental health concerns in targeted Latino communities of Chicago through discussions, assessments, and audits. The communities will then guide the project's direction through their involvement in each step of data collection, development of interventions, and evaluation. By having an active role in the project's method and process, the communities will not only understand the importance of good school environmental health, but also gain the tools and resources to effectively address environmental stressors that will improve their overall quality of life.      The goal of this project is to reduce disparities of asthma-related illnesses and obesity in the quality of care, quality of life, and diagnoses of these conditions in Latino communities. The project has four aims:  1) develop a better understanding of the impact of the school environment, and a large school district's policies that influence this environment, on asthma and obesity; 2) develop a common language between 'professionals' and 'community members/parents' that will be used to activate, then resonate with school administrators; 3) evaluate two different models of community organizing in a school-based setting; and 4) open lines of communication and working partnerships between schools and community health providers.

"Promoting Disaster and Terrorism Preparedness in Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 award is to allow David Eisenman, MD, MSHS to develop the skills to conduct community interventions for reducing disparities in health protection for terrorism and public health disasters among low-income Latinos of Mexican and Central-American descent. The award will provide an excellent transition from investigations Dr. Eisenman completed with Latino survivors of political violence and on racial/ethnic disparities in terrorism preparedness and response. The career development plan proposes mentored coursework, tutorials, and investigations to support learning in three core areas: (1) Health promotion research, (2) intervention design and analysis, and (3) terrorism and public health disasters.  Latinos are disproportionately affected by disasters and terrorism. The career development activities will be applied to studies developing and testing a narrowcast marketing campaign supplemented with a community health promoter educational outreach to promote preparedness (the intervention). Dr. Eisenman will perform a needs assessment study gathering formative data from community focus groups of low-income Latinos of Mexican and Central-American descent to understand their beliefs regarding preparedness activities, barriers, preferences and facilitators to adopting and sustaining activities, and the behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge that must be addressed in the intervention. The intervention will be devised and refined using participatory research methods and a second round of focus groups. The intervention will be fielded using a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent comparison group design to test its effects and a program valuation will be performed. Results will serve as data for an R01 proposal to more fully evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention.

"Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary lifestyle is directly associated with disease and reduced quality of life. While the general United States population is suffering from an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. Modern behavioral informatics interventions that use theory-based computer-run expert systems show great promise to provide more effective interventions for hard-to-reach populations at lower cost. The present application is in response to PA-04-153, 'Health Disparities Among Minority and Underserved Women.' We aim to both culturally and linguistically modify an evidence-based, inidvidually tailored intervention, founded on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, to target sedentary Latinas. This print-based, expert system intervention has been developed and tested by Dr. Bess Marcus and her team, who have spent 18 years developing programs to increase physical activity in sedentary adults. The study will involve two phases: 1) a formative research period in which 100 Latinas will be recruited to provide data on how to modify the current tailored intervention to be culturally congruent and 2) a pilot randomized trial with 80 recruited Latinas to test the modified intervention against off-the-shelf bilingual health educational materials for Latinas. The formative research phase will involve an iterative process of qualitative data collection and intervention modification, with: 1) translation from English to Spanish; 2) an initial round of exploratory focus groups to obtain data on unique themes to include in the modified intervention; 3) a second round of confirmatory focus groups to examine responses to modified intervention materials; and 4) a series of intensive individual cognitive interviews to examine readability and comprehension, consistency of perception of materials with theory, and conceptual integrity of the intervention materials across English and Spanish. The pilot study will provide data on feasibility as well as on effect size of the modified intervention to inform a future clinical trial. Secondary analyses will explore differences in intervention effect based on levels of acculturation and of ethnic identity.             ",Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas,7197865,R21NR009864,"['artificial intelligence ', ' public health ', ' lifestyle ', ' Hispanic American ', ' clinical research ', ' focus group ', ' ']",NINR,MIRIAM HOSPITAL,R21,2006,210300,0.059834713854874585
"Advanced Center for Latino and MH Systems Research    DESCRIPTIONS (provided by applicant):       Center Core. There are pervasive ethnic and racial disparities in mental health service utilization and in mental health status yet the underlying causes of these disparities are poorly understood. This application seeks to establish an Advanced Center for Latino and Mental Health Systems Research (Advanced Latino Disparities Center) that focuses on understanding the factors affecting mental health service disparities in Latinos and generating research and knowledge to eliminate them. This Center will be part of the Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research (CMMHR) and is built on the strengths and learning experiences of our ongoing NIMH-funded Latino Research Program Project (LRPP). The proposed Center is a five-year project, structured around two large (R01) and two smaller (pilot) projects. We support the research with an Administrative and Methods Core led by experienced, multidisciplinary investigators, build on the collaborative partnerships that characterize our past work, and mentor and develop junior investigators to become new experts in health disparities research. The overall aims of the Advanced Latino Disparities Center are to: (1) Establish an administrative structure that supports a synergistic core of researchers to conduct mental health service disparities research; (2) Institute a methodological and statistical component as an integral part of the proposed program; (3) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary mental health services disparity research program with a focus on four program areas: (a) Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos; (b) Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos; (c) Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care; and (d) Dialog with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements; (4) Continue developing a cadre of young investigators committed to mental health service disparities research with Latino populations; and (5) Disseminate the research findings to inform policy decisions and practice, contribute to stakeholders' knowledge, and encourage future disparities research in Latino communities.      Project 1: Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos. The goal of this project is to develop and test a mixed methods approach to helping clinicians in public health psychiatric settings decrease clinical uncertainty by more accurately diagnosing patients with diverse cultural backgrounds and improving the matching of clinical services to the needs of Latinos. Our approach combines methods from cultural anthropology with statistical methods and psychiatric epidemiology. The specific aims of this study focus on generating improved cultural formulations and diagnostic accuracy using information from qualitative and quantitative perspectives, iterating between the methods in a complementary fashion. The specific aims are to: Aim 1: Identify the information about symptoms and cultural and social context gathered in the initial diagnostic interview, that clinicians use to make determinations about three disorders: major depression, drug abuse and alcohol abuse; Aim 2: Use data from an epidemiological survey to assess the potential sensitivity and specificity of the clinical determinations identified in Aim1 in detecting the underlying diagnosis. We will test the hypothesis that clinical diagnosis is less accurate for Latino than non-Latino white patients; Aim 3: Assess clinician and patient reactions to the recommended improvements to diagnostic assessments developed in Aim 2. Using focus groups and consensus panels, prioritize the kinds of information to be collected to improve diagnostic determinations in safety net settings. Aim 4: Apply the findings of Aim 3 to make concrete recommendations to improve the efficiency and fairness of diagnostic decisions for Latino and non-Latino white population groups.      Project 2: Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos. In this research we propose to conduct statistical analyses of data from a large quasi-experimental project (ACCESS) and a 2-stage modified Delphi technique to generate recommendations for the modification of assertive community treatment (ACT) when applied to Latino and other severely mentally ill homeless (SMIH) minority populations. The ACCESS study compared the outcome effects of ""augmented"" ACT (i.e., ACT + quality improvement intervention) and standard ACT, and found no evidence of differences. Utilizing a disparities framework, advanced statistical methods, and a 2-stage Delphi method, we propose to conduct service and outcomes disparities research aimed at generating information with clinical or programmatic utility for Latinos. The proposed analyses will generate new evidence on service use and outcomes for Latino SMIH persons treated with ACT, and will broaden our understanding of the effects of quality improvement interventions for   Latinos. Findings will be integrated with expert opinion to generate recommendations regarding ACT for Latino SMIH persons.   The study has four aims:   1. To test for disparities in service use for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   2. To test for outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   3. To estimate the impact of observed service disparities on observed outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons   4. To integrate results from analyses of service and outcome disparities for Latinos, a literature review, and expert opinion, and generate recommendations to improve ACT for Latino SMIH persons.      Pilot 1: Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care. Parental belief that the child needs mental health care has been found to be the most significant factor associated with service use in non-minority populations. The results of several studies suggest that Latino parents are less likely than European Americans to recognize and/or label their children's behavior as a mental health problem requiring intervention. It is not clear which factors explain this lower recognition of mental health problems by Latino parents, and consequently the lower utilization of mental health services by this group. Differences between providers and parents in their views of children's impairments and/or the kind of problems that require treatment may also explain some of the lower utilization of mental health services among Latino children. There is some evidence that providers from different cultures differ in their impairment ratings of children. However, there is no research that examines whether non-Latino white providers as compared to Latino providers are more likely to rate the same children as impaired, nor is there any research that assesses the extent to which parents and providers from different cultures differ in their ratings of children's impairment. This pilot aims to investigate parental and provider beliefs about what is impaired behavior, the severity of the behavior, and the need for treatment in a sample of Mexican Americans, island Puerto Rican and non-Latino providers and parents. We will examine the ratings of providers and parents from the three ethnic groups using case vignettes of children with different levels of impairment and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Vignettes will be developed utilizing information obtained through secondary analyses of two clinical data sets. We will test the hypothesis that Puerto Rican and Mexican American parents and providers rate the children described in the vignettes as less impaired as compared to non-Latino white parents and providers. We further hypothesize that greater acculturation in Mexican American parents will be associated with less variation between Mexican American and non- Latino white parents in their impairment ratings of the vignettes. We also expect greater congruence in the impairment ratings and perceptions of need for services among parents and providers within the same ethnic group.      Pilot 2: Dialogue with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements. A disproportionate number of Latinos rely on free or reduced price care making them more vulnerable to the impact of shrinking resources on the quality of care at safety net healthcare systems. The main goal of this pilot is to identify quality improvements by increasing the Latino community voice in a safety net mental healthcare system. We will explore system concerns (disproportionate impact of economic constraints on quality of care and low levels of participation in mental health services among Latinos) by including members of the Latino community in a participatory research process together with representatives of a healthcare system (i.e., psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, senior hospital administrators, clinic coordinators). In addition, this resulting collaborative stakeholder group will jointly identify leverage points in the community and health care system to launch quality improvements.    The aims of the pilot are to:   1. Consult multiple stakeholders to identify community, client, administrative, provider and mental health care system barriers to access and quality mental health services for Latino patients.   2. Selecting barriers identified from Aim 1, conduct policy implementation analyses that ground the participatory process in a clear, shared understanding of the legal, administrative and fiscal constraints on efforts aimed at quality improvements.   3. Use the information generated in Aims 1 and 2 to launch a participatory process with multiple stakeholders to identify leverage points for mental health care system change. As part of this research, we will generate hypotheses to be tested in the context of community and/or systems interventions and their prospective evaluation in R01 applications.   We intend to use qualitative methods and policy implementation analysis to address these aims. We will build a collaborative, multidisciplinary community and mental health systems advisory group to assist in the identification and design of these quality improvements. By the end of this pilot, we will have a sustainable group of advisors who will work together in the future implementation of the quality improvements identified through this pilot work.      Center Core:         ",Advanced Center for Latino and MH Systems Research,7126841,P50MH073469,[''],NIMH,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,P50,2006,1018292,0.11234412173972488
"Redes En Accion: National Latino Cancer Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Action is urgently needed to address persistent disparities in cancer control and prevention that harm the health of Latino populations.

"Primary Care For Trauma-related Mental Health Problems    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and sub threshold PTSD present to primary care clinicians (PCCs) at rates similar to depression. The estimated lifetime prevalence of PTSD is 7.8% in the general population and is higher for underserved populations that are at greater risk for PTSD resulting from interpersonal, political, and community violence. Moreover, PTSD is poorly detected, under-treated, and debilitating. But, unlike the maturing field of depression in primary care with successful quality improvement interventions, little is known about effectively treating PTSD in this setting. We will employ a theory-based multi-level framework for guiding the first step in a program of research geared toward the development of primary care-based interventions for PTSD. We plan to follow with a full-scale effectiveness study application based on the results of this proposed work. We propose an exploratory study (R34) to better understand primary care trauma management and to identify promising strategies for improving the care of adult Latino immigrant patients suffering from PTSD and sub threshold PTSD. We will conduct this research in collaboration with the Clinical Directors Network, Inc. (CDN), a community-oriented practice-based research network that provides primary and preventive health care services for poor and underserved minority and immigrant populations. Specifically, we aim to:1. Describe primary care for PTSD and sub threshold PTSD from multiple stakeholder perspectives (medical directors, PCCs, and patients) among a sample of community/migrant health centers (C/MHCs) ranging in structural characteristics, and with a high proportion of Latino immigrant patients. 2. Identify structural and individual PCC predictors of PCC tendency to screen for, assess, refer, and manage PTSD and sub threshold PTSD. 3. Elucidate potential intervention strategies, based on data from Aims 1 and 2, to develop recommendations for viable strategies that could be tested in a follow-on study to improve primary care for PTSD and sub threshold PTSD. For Aim 1, we will conduct site visits and interviews with three types of key informants from a purposeful sample of five of the 57 C/MHCs that serve Latino immigrants and refugees in one CDN region that represent a range of clinical structures that might affect PTSD care (5 medical directors, 15 PCCs, and 4 patients with current PTSD matched to each of the 15 PCCs, N=60). For Aim 2, we will formally test hypotheses about predictors of variation in treatment for PTSD with a representative survey of a census of all 57 C/MHC directors and a random sample of 285 PCCs (5 per C/MHC). Aim 3 will use Aim 1 and 2 data and stakeholder meetings to identify potential interventions most likely to improve PTSD management and will culminate with a follow-on R01 application to implement and evaluate a promising intervention program for primary care-based treatment of PTSD and sub threshold PTSD in adult, Latino immigrants.

"Promotion of Physical Activity in the Latino Community The San Diego Prevention Research Center (SDPRC) is an interdisciplinary academic-community partnership committed to conducting research and education in promoting physical activity (PA) and improving the health of Latinos. The community partner organization is the San Ysidro Health Clinic Inc., (SYHC), located near the San Diego/Tijuana border, and our Community Committee, of which the SYHC is a member, is the Enhancing Family Resources Collaborative (EFRC). The SDPRC comprises collaboration between a School of Public Health (SPH, San Diego State University; SDSU), a School of Medicine with a residency in Preventive Medicine (University of California at San Diego; UCSD), and a Department of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences (ENS; SDSU). Thus, training efforts will be readily accessible not only to practitioners but also to SPH and ENS graduate (masters and doctoral) and undergraduate students, and to UCSD preventive medicine residents. As a result of the training and education activities, the SDPRC will create a network of experienced professionals that will serve the needs of San Ysidro and other South Bay communities with respect to PA promotion, program evaluation, and community building. The core research activities we propose include conducting a community-wide needs and assets assessment for PA in San Ysidro, and developing and evaluating a community-wide walking initiative for adults and a soccer games/leagues enhancement program for children and adolescents. The SDPRC plans to create a PRC Latino Health Network as both a web- and meeting-based activity that will provide a forum for sharing strategies with the national PRC network to empower Latinos to reduce health disparities particular to their communities. The web site will have measurement materials, resource guides, community partner links, and conference information.

"Latino Based Multimedia to Prevent NIHL    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Noise induced hearing loss (NIHL) is the most common occupational disease in the United States (NIOSH, 1996). This proposal addresses hearing health among the 1.4 million Latino (Hispanic) construction workers, a population that comprises 17 percent of the U.S. construction workforce (CPWR, 2002). In keeping with the major goal of Healthy People 2010 to eliminate disparities in health outcomes in minority populations and objective 28-18 to ""reduce adult hearing loss in the noise-exposed public"" (USDHHS, 2000), the project goal is to adapt, implement and evaluate a health communication intervention to prevent NIHL in Latino construction workers. Through testing of the Health Promotion Model (Pender, 1987) in previous studies, the Investigators identified the predictors of construction workers' use of hearing protection, designed Theory-based interventions to promote use of hearing protection, and derived the Predictors of Use of Hearing Protection Model (PUHPM). The proposed study will build on results of the PI's previous studies and uses innovative health communication technology to deliver the intervention in an individually tailored, interactive multimedia format. The purpose of this project is to adapt and evaluate an innovative, culturally specific, computer-based tailored (CBT), intervention to increase Latino construction workers' use of hearing protection equipment. In the PIs previous study, tailoring health messages to individual workers and delivering informational boosters were shown to be effective health communication strategies of improve workers' use of hearing protection, thereby ultimately reducing their risk of NIHL. Three specific aims will be addressed in this study: 1) assess the acceptability of a CBT intervention adapted for use with Latino construction workers with text and sound in equivalent Spanish and English versions; 2) evaluate the effect of the CBT intervention with and without a booster intervention on Latino construction workers' use of hearing protection equipment; and 3) test the PUHPM as an explanatory model of Latino construction workers' use of hearing protection by determining if changes in theoretically-specified variables are associated with changes in use of hearing protection.         ",Latino Based Multimedia to Prevent NIHL,7045954,R25DC005623,"['computer human interaction ', ' noise induced deafness ', ' computer assisted instruction ', ' disease /disorder prevention /control ', ' human subject ', ' occupational health /safety ', ' occupational hazard ', ' health behavior ', ' Hispanic American ', ' culture ', ' interactive multimedia ', ' clinical research ', ' educational resource design /development ', ' medically underserved population ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R25,2006,180360,0.040447925968414386
"Infertility in Low-Income Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall aim of this qualitative, anthropological research is to examine the experiences of low-income Latinos of Mexican American and Central American descent who experience infertility. The specific aims are: 1) to examine the experience of infertility, including cultural meanings associated with gender and fertility, and cultural values about family and parenthood; 2) to examine access to the health care system for infertility treatment and use; 3) to explore the process of seeking and undergoing treatment for infertility; and 4) to examine the ways in which women and men seek to resolve fertility problems in the face of scarce resources, including efforts to become parents through non-medical means. The specific aims will be carried out by studying 120 women and 120 men who are their partners, age 21 and up, using qualitative methods. There will be three interviews at 6-month intervals: an initial couple interview will be followed six months later by solo interviews with each partner, and a final couple interview on year after the initial interview. In cases where it is not possible to include the male partner, women will be followed for all three interviews.   The sample will be drawn in approximately equal numbers from 1) the community itself, and 2) a low-income infertility clinic geographically situated within the community that serves this population. Qualitative analysis will be undertaken in a systematic progress of steps.

"Behavior & Clinical Trials Participation in HIV+ Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through this research career development award, I will complete the initial steps to establish myself as an independent researcher in HIV/AIDS behavioral research to reduce health disparities in Latino communities infected with HIV. Using didactic and mentored learning, I will improve upon my existing behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative research skills to address the issue of low participation in HIV/AIDS clinical trials in Latino communities. Proportionate representation of minority populations in research trials is necessary to improve research capacity to generalize results to diverse populations infected with HIV. My specific research aims are to: 1) Describe and understand the attitudes, beliefs, cultural and social norms, provider and system influences relating to entry into clinical trials in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and 2) Develop and pilot test an intervention for improving understanding and acceptance of HIV clinical trials participation by HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos and their communities. The theoretical framework of the research plan is the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (Andersen, Aday, et al.). The research plan will be carried out in three phases, each phase linked to a career development objective and activity. In Phase 1 I will conduct formative research using qualitative methods with HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, including design and implementation of an in-depth interview protocol and focus group questions to explore factors to consider in attempting to improve clinical trials participation in Latino populations. In Phase 2 I will carry out qualitative analysis, develop a social cognitive model of participation in research, develop research hypotheses, and develop and pilot test a survey to test the social cognitive model in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos. In Phase 3 I will validate the survey, analyze and report outcomes, design and pilot-test a behavioral intervention to increase clinical trials participation in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and finally, use intervention pilot data to prepare an R01 proposal to the NIH to promote participation of HIV+ Latinos in clinical trials.

"A Cultural Approach to the Study of Latino Parenting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Latino children and adolescents have higher rates of behavior problems and academic failure compared with chilldren and adolescents from other ethnic groups. The developmental outcomes of Latino youth appear to be related to family functioning variables and to parenting practices in particular. Yet, there is limited understanding of Latino parenting and of the relation between Latino parenting and child outcomes. The purpose of this application is to study Latino parenting of preschool-aged children using a culturally informed framework of parenting that focuses on cultural childrearing values and Latina mothers' value-driven behavior in different cultural contexts, as well as a traditional framework of parenting, to predict child behavior and pre-academic functioning. An understanding of parenting practices that are predictive of child behavioral and pre-academic functioning in Latino preschoolers is critical in the design of preventive interventions that enhance functioning among Latino preschoolers by promoting specific parenting practices.  Such services are key in addressing mental health disparities seen between Latino and non-Latino youth. To accomplish these goals, a career development plan will focus on training for the Candidate in: 1) culturally informed research, 2) ethnographic methodology, 3) behavioral observation and coding of parentchild interactions, and 4) statistical methods and analyses related to measure development, qualitative studies, model testing, and prevention trials. Training will be accomplished through formal coursework, individual tutorials with mentors and consultants, and participation in conferences on relevant topjcs.  Moreover, this training plan will be supplemented by a research plan that includes a qualitative study of cultural childrearing values that will be used for measurement development and a quantitative study of Latino parenting, assessed from both cultural and traditional perspectives, and its relation to child behavior and pre-academic functioning.

"HIV Among Rural Latino Gay Men and MSM in the Southeast    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern United States has the fastest growing Latino population in the country and at the same time carries a disproportionate HIV/AIDS disease burden. We propose a 2-year exploratory study (R21) to understand and characterize social and sexual networking patterns and socio-cultural and psychological correlates of sexual risk within a population about which little is currently known: newly-arrived, less-acculturated Latino gay men and Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) living in the rural Southeast. The AIDS case rate for Latino men is over 3 times that for non-Latino white men. The most common means of HIV transmission among Latinos is through same-sex sexual behavior. Among Latino gay men and Latino MSM in North Carolina, condom use rates are considerably lower than rates reported in other parts of the US. In a sample of MSM recruited in 3 bars in central NC, 69% of Spanish-preferring Latino MSM who reported having anal intercourse within the past 3 months reported inconsistent condom use with non-steady male partners. We also found that 32% reported having sex with both men and women within the past 3 months, and none of the men reported having ever been tested for HIV. Little is known about these men's social and sexual networking patterns and risk behaviors. This study will generate scientific knowledge and understanding needed to characterize risk and help identify potentially effective intervention approaches and strategies to reduce HIV exposure and transmission within this population. We will use 3 modes of data collection: (a) 30 rural Latino gay men and Latino MSM will complete iterative in-depth interviews (each respondent will be interviewed 3 times) to gain ""insider"" perspectives on HIV risk and prevention; (b) 16 local Latino-service and health providers will complete one-time in-depth interviews to gain ""outsider"" perspectives on HIV risk and prevention; and (c) 211 rural Latino gay men and Latino MSM will complete an interviewer- administered assessment to be developed based on formative interview data, through respondent-driven sampling (RDS). RDS is an innovative statistical approach to sampling to provide unbiased population estimates when a predetermined sampling frame is unknown. The proposed study will advance the field of HIV prevention research by generating in-depth knowledge necessary to develop culturally-appropriate models to better explain condom use within vulnerable communities: recently arrived, less-acculturated Latino gay men and Latino MSM who live in the rural Southeast. Study findings also will help shape new multilevel intervention approaches and strategies to reduce the disproportionate HIV/AIDS disease burden of Latino men.           ",HIV Among Rural Latino Gay Men and MSM in the Southeast,7166722,R21HD049282,"['communicable disease control ', ' communicable disease transmission ', ' AIDS education /prevention ', ' health care personnel ', ' human subject ', ' AIDS ', ' HIV infection ', ' interview ', ' high risk behavior /lifestyle ', ' sex behavior ', ' homosexual ', ' male ', ' Hispanic American ', ' rural area ', ' human immunodeficiency virus 1 ', ' condom ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' safe sex /sex abstinence ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2006,188936,0.040956538240497255
"Understanding ADHD in Low-Income Latino Children. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most research on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been conducted with sample groups of white, middle class boys living in suburban settings. Very few studies related to ADHD have been conducted with Latino children despite the fact that Latinos will soon be the largest ethnic minority group in this country. Research is needed to identify culturally sensitive, valid, and clinically useful methods for diagnosing ADHD and for assessing clinical characteristics such as impairment level and comorbidity patterns among Latino children. Theoretical frameworks specifically developed to take into account the unique cultural, historical, and socio-economic characteristics of most Latinos in this country would greatly facilitate research on Latino children with ADHD. The research aims of this project are (1) to determine the optimum number of symptoms from the DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) needed for the diagnosis of ADHD in a sample of Latino and White children living in low income urban settings; (2) to determine the optimal cut off scores for Latino and White children with ADHD on the ADHD Rating Scale IV; (3) to determine whether Latino and White children living in low-income urban settings differ in comorbidity patterns for ADHD, Combined Type (ADHD/COM); (4) to explore the relationship between familism (a cultural value that involves strong identification with and attachment to members of nuclear and extended families), acculturation and level of impairment and comorbidity among Latino children. To test Aims (1) through (4), 100 teacher-referred Latino children, and 100 teacher-referred White children between the ages of 6 and 13 attending seven public schools in a low income area with predominantly Latino and White student population will be assessed. My goal for the next five years is to conduct independent research to investigate diagnostic and clinical issues arising in Latino children and families coping with ADHD. In order for me to become proficient in these areas, my mentors and I have developed an educational plan with four specific aims: 1. To become proficient in understanding the unique needs of Latino families coping with ADHD; 2. To develop knowledge and practical skills in the assessment of ADHD among Latino children; 3. To become knowledgeable about comorbid disorders among Latino children with ADHD; 4. To become more proficient in research design and statistics. In addition, I will receive training in the responsible conduct of research. In order to insure that all aspects of this research project are responsive to the values and needs of Latino families, I will assemble a stakeholder group composed of Latino parents, professionals, and paraprofessionals from the local Latino community. The completion of the proposed research and educational plans will enable me to become a skilled independent researcher and to develop empirically based, culturally sensitive assessment and intervention procedures for what is currently an under-served segment of children and families coping with ADHD.

"Latin American Cancer Research Coalition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   There are approximately 36 million Latinos known to be living in the US and by the year 2050, this group will constitute 25 percent of the US population.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death among this rapidly growing minority group.  Latinos have higher rates of cancers with infectious etiologies.  For other sites, despite lower incidence, Latinos have more late stage, higher mortality-to-incidence ratios, and inferior survival compared to Caucasians.  Lifestyle changes associated with acculturation may also increase future cancer risks.  The greater Washington-Baltimore tri-state region (DC, Maryland, Virginia) has one of the largest urban concentrations of Latinos in the US. Latinos in this region are predominately of Central and South American ancestry, recently immigrated, un-insured, and largely monolingual.  We developed the Latin American Cancer Research Coalition (LACRC) as a local network in DC to address the unique needs of this Latino subgroup.  In our first 4 years, the LACRC trained community coordinators, students, and faculty, submitted an R25T post-doctoral grant, obtained pilot and career development funding, published manuscripts, and disseminated results with the community.  We propose to expand the LACRC as a regional network.  The overarching goal of this regional network is to document, understand, and reduce cancer disparities in Latinos.  LACRC partners include multidisciplinary, multicultural, and bilingual researchers and staff from the Washington Hospital Center/Cancer Institute, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown university, 19 community safety net clinics across our region, the Inova-Fairfax community hospital, and consultants and advisors from the regional Departments of Health and Tumor Registries, the Council of Latino Agencies, the National Council of La Raza, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the regional NCI Cancer Information Service and Spanish-language support line, the ACS, and others.  LACRC aims are to:  1) enhance capacity, especially for data collection on Latinos; 2) use the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to guide participatory research and use results to inform education, training, and planning; and 3) obtain funding, influence policy, and evaluate progress.  The structure of the LACRC is ideally suited as a platform for bridging the gaps between research discovery and delivery, and developing, evaluating, and disseminating culturally competent interventions across the spectrum of cancer control.

"Redes En Accion: National Latino Cancer Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Action is urgently needed to address persistent disparities in cancer control and prevention that harm the health of Latino populations.  To meet this need, we propose a comprehensive set of research, education, and training activities to be carried out at the national level and in regional centers in California, Florida, New York, and Texas by an established network of investigators uniquely qualified to understand issues from the perspectives of their diverse populations and to serve as leaders and role models for influencing change and fostering a new generation of Latino scientists and policy advocates.  Research activities will include: 1) development of disparity-related pilot projects for proposals to obtain independent NCI funding for Latino scientists; 2) national, regional, and local policy studies analyzing factors influencing disparities in access to cancer control and prevention, and the capacities of advocates concerned with this issue; and 3) multi-site evaluation of an experimental intervention designed to improve women's capacities for navigating health care systems that provide cancer screening and care.  Education activities at the national and regional levels will include:  1) multi-modal public education and outreach and 2) professional education and outreach for clinical providers and for organizations concerned with policies that influence access to cancer screening and care.  Training activities will consist of mentoring and pilot research support for students and junior scientists developing careers in research aimed at understanding and reducing disparities that affect the cancer health of Latinos.

"Greater Denver Latino Cancer Prevention/Control Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The Latino Research and Policy Center, under PI Dr. Estevan Flores, at the University of Colorado at Denver, will expand its SPN to 30 Latino community based organizations and create the Colorado Front Range Latino Community Network (CFRLCN) in 10 Colorado counties, representing 80 percent of all Colorado Latinos and 83 percent of all Latino cancer cases.  The Network will be composed of health clinics and agencies serving Latinos including Denver Health Medical Center, the CU Health Sciences' Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Disease Prevention Division, and La Salud Health Clinics. The CFRLCN builds on previous work on cancer awareness, education and research activities in the Latino population like our SPN's five pilot projects. Future activities include efforts in awareness, prevention and early detection of breast, cervical, prostate, lung (including smoking cessation) and colorectal cancers.  Colorado Cancer Registry data has been used to target specific cancers for intervention in these 10 counties.  Education and prevention activities include Dia de la Mujer Latina, and a colorectal education/prevention outreach program.  The CFRLCN will reduce cancer health disparities in the 10 counties and will embark, in Years 1 and 2, on a community participatory research framework in intervention research to achieve these aims.  This work will lead to development of interventions and pilot proposals and large scale interventions (R01s).

"Joining Forces with a Key Community to Reduce Obesity Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Obesity is a significant risk factor for the development of many common chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers. Evidence is accumulating that diet and physical activity are important for preventing obesity and protecting health. African-Americans, Latinos, and Pacific Islanders are more likely to experience high rates of obesity, lower levels of physical activity, and poor dietary habits than white communities.  Thus, obesity has emerged as a dominant and growing contributor to chronic disease disparities. Investigators from the UCLA School of Public Health have teamed up with the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services (DHS) to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) framework to select and pilot test an obesity control intervention among the staffs of health and social service agencies (including units within the health department and private community-based organizations [CBOs].  The DHS has long served in a convener role in addressing obesity in the community and has a staff of nearly 100,000, mostly African-American women and Latinos.  It also has relationships with and leverage to drive change in the many CBOs with which it collaborates to deliver health services; the demographic composition of these CBOs is also predominantly female and Latino or African-American.  Thus, the DHS is a perfect community partner in a CBPR effort to identify and test obesity prevention and control interventions.  The UCLA investigators have a long-standing commitment to conducting community based health disparities research.  This planning grant will provide crucial financial and institutional support to further develop and maintain the structures and communication channels necessary for an effective partnership between the academic research team, the health department, and other community agencies.  A Community Investigator Team, comprised of representatives from health and social services agencies and convened by DHS, will work closely with the research team to ensure that community input shapes each phase of the research process.  During the 3-year project period, a collaborative decision-making process will be utilized to identify, prioritize, and select obesity control intervention strategies. The project is innovative in its selection of these staff as the targeted ""community,"" and in its incorporation of evidence based decision-making algorithm into the intervention selection process. A pilot study that is both scientifically rigorous and acceptable to the community will test the intervention strategies.  Finally, the data from the pilot study will be analyzed and used to develop an R01 application. Results will also be disseminated among participating organizations.       This innovative community-based participatory research project will team UCLA researchers with local health department investigators to engage the staff of health and social services agencies in selecting and preliminarily testing obesity control interventions for their work settings.

"Latin American Cancer Research Coalition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   There are approximately 36 million Latinos known to be living in the US and by the year 2050, this group will constitute 25 percent of the US population.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death among this rapidly growing minority group.  Latinos have higher rates of cancers with infectious etiologies.  For other sites, despite lower incidence, Latinos have more late stage, higher mortality-to-incidence ratios, and inferior survival compared to Caucasians.  Lifestyle changes associated with acculturation may also increase future cancer risks.  The greater Washington-Baltimore tri-state region (DC, Maryland, Virginia) has one of the largest urban concentrations of Latinos in the US. Latinos in this region are predominately of Central and South American ancestry, recently immigrated, un-insured, and largely monolingual.  We developed the Latin American Cancer Research Coalition (LACRC) as a local network in DC to address the unique needs of this Latino subgroup.  In our first 4 years, the LACRC trained community coordinators, students, and faculty, submitted an R25T post-doctoral grant, obtained pilot and career development funding, published manuscripts, and disseminated results with the community.  We propose to expand the LACRC as a regional network.  The overarching goal of this regional network is to document, understand, and reduce cancer disparities in Latinos.  LACRC partners include multidisciplinary, multicultural, and bilingual researchers and staff from the Washington Hospital Center/Cancer Institute, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown university, 19 community safety net clinics across our region, the Inova-Fairfax community hospital, and consultants and advisors from the regional Departments of Health and Tumor Registries, the Council of Latino Agencies, the National Council of La Raza, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the regional NCI Cancer Information Service and Spanish-language support line, the ACS, and others.  LACRC aims are to:  1) enhance capacity, especially for data collection on Latinos; 2) use the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to guide participatory research and use results to inform education, training, and planning; and 3) obtain funding, influence policy, and evaluate progress.  The structure of the LACRC is ideally suited as a platform for bridging the gaps between research discovery and delivery, and developing, evaluating, and disseminating culturally competent interventions across the spectrum of cancer control.  Our approach should be broadly portable to reducing disparities in other US urban Latino communities         ",Latin American Cancer Research Coalition,7234064,U01CA114593,[''],NCI,MEDSTAR HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTE,U01,2007,800445,0.1537713908872325
"Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos have been consistently found to underutilize formal mental health services and are less likely to receive quality care for mental and behavioral disorders compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Efficacious treatments for mental disorders are available, but dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions for Latinos is limited. An annual LBHI Conference for five years is proposed to improve the exchange of scientific findings and enhance collaboration among 1000 attendees annually representing researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, consumers and their families. The conference sessions will provide findings on evidence-based interventions across the life span, and sessions that address the contextual issues (e.g., culturally and linguistically relevant program approaches, community characteristics, system-level barriers and interventions), and process issues (e.g. engagement strategies) that are critical to addressing the disparities in service access and utilization. The Conferences are a collaborative effort between LBHI and national, state, county and community partners to provide a forum for the exchange of information on the distinctive mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, and resilience issues of Latinos. They are also designed to provide a forum for developing strategic partnerships and community participation to support research capacity relevant to Latino mental health. The Conferences support, as attendees, investigators at the pre-doctoral, post-doctoral, and early investigator levels to stimulate their interest in Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the Latino organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. LBHI will convene a national strategic planning process to identify the: 1) information needs of target attendees regarding evidence-based interventions in Latino service settings and 2) effective dissemination and implementation mechanisms to address conference objectives. Barriers to effective dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions into Latino service settings will be addressed by the Conferences through the following objectives. The annual Conference will: (1) result in enhanced capacity of researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, and consumers and their families to collaborate in the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions in service settings for Latinos; (2) increase the capacity to conduct research in Latino mental health service settings through the formation of strategic partnerships, community engagement and the submission of NIH grant applications; and, (3) increase investigator knowledge and interest in addressing Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. The Latino Behavioral Health Institute (LBHI) proposes a series of five annual conferences designed to enhance behavioral health services to the Latino community, the fastest growing, and yet in terms of mental health services, the most underserved population in the United States. The purpose of the annual conferences is to facilitate the exchange of scientific information and clinical experience among the over 1000 attendees including researchers, clinicians, policy makers, consumers and their families. By improving the link between research and clinical practice, the LBHI conferences aim to provide participants with the knowledge and skills to decrease the disparities in mental health service utilization among Latinos and improve the overall health and mental health of the largest minority group in the United States.          ",Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference,7274624,R13MH078724,[''],NIMH,LATINO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INSTITUTE,R13,2007,25000,0.04588180892476277
"Developing a Navigation System for Latinos with Lung or Head-and-Neck Cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to conduct a one year developmental study designed to provide the information necessary to prepare a successful grant application to conduct a multi-center trial to test the effectiveness of navigation to improve the outcomes of Latino patients with Lung and/or Head-and-Neck (H&N) cancers. Patients with these cancers experience high levels of morbidity that often require careful coordination between multiple medical specialties to receive proper treatment and rehabilitation. Like other medically underserved patients, Latinos are disproportionately lost-to-follow-up or experience avoidable delays during this process. The many cultural, language, and health care access challenges faced by Latinos make the coordination of care especially difficult for cancers with such high morbidity as these. Thus, there is a need to create effective patient navigation programs that can better assist Latino patients and their health care team for these cancers. An in-depth interview design, augmented with medical chart reviews, will be used to obtain information on key barriers from relevant health care professionals, lay-health workers, and Lung and H&N cancer patients at Denver Health. Six key informant interviews will be conducted with health care professionals from the divisions of primary care, pulmonary medicine, otorhinolaryngology, surgery, medical oncology, and radiation oncology. Focus group interviews of 6 members each will be conducted with at least four groups of individuals: 1) patients who have or had Lung cancer, 2) patients who have or had H&N cancer, 3) caregivers of patients who have or had Lung and/or H&N cancer, and 4) lay health-workers who are employed as patient navigators for other cancer patients at Denver Health. Key informants and focus group interviewees will be asked to identify other key individuals that have not been interviewed but that should be included because of their relevant role in the care of these patients. From the list, an additional 8 individuals will be interviewed using one-on-one semi-structured interviews. The final outcome will be a protocol to be tested in a future randomized, controlled trial of a navigation program for cancer treatment and recovery for these patients. Creating effective interventions to reduce cancer treatment disparities among Latinos has significant public health implications given that Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among Latinos and second among Latinas (American Lung Association, 2005).          ",Developing a Navigation System for Latinos with Lung or Head-and-Neck Cancer,7336584,U01CA114604,"['Ensure ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Radiation Oncology ', ' Medical Oncology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Head and Neck Cancer ', ' malignant head and neck tumor ', ' Malignant Head and Neck Neoplasm ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' American Lung Association ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Depth ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Otolaryngology ', ' otorhinolaryngology ', ' Oto/Rhino/Laryngology ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Pulmonary Disease (Specialty) ', ' Pulmonology ', ' Pulmonary Medicine ', ' Pneumonology ', ' Pneumology ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Physical Health Services / Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Head and neck structure ', ' Head and Neck ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Services ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Latino ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Communication ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' head and neck cancer patient ', ' HNC patient ', ' Navigation System ', ' medically underserved ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER/HSC DENVER,U01,2007,84249,0.07959534126246237
"Partnership to Reduce Asthma & Obesity in Latino Schools    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Schools serving minority and low-income students suffer disproportionately from environmental hazards.  These hazards include poor indoor air quality and nutritionally poor food choices which contribute to increased rates of asthma-related conditions and obesity in these communities. A four year project is proposed. The Community Partnership for Healthy School Environments consists of community-based organizations, research scientists, and health care providers. Partners will identify specific school environmental health concerns in targeted Latino communities of Chicago through discussions, assessments, and audits. The communities will then guide the project's direction through their involvement in each step of data collection, development of interventions, and evaluation. By having an active role in the project's method and process, the communities will not only understand the importance of good school environmental health, but also gain the tools and resources to effectively address environmental stressors that will improve their overall quality of life.      The goal of this project is to reduce disparities of asthma-related illnesses and obesity in the quality of care, quality of life, and diagnoses of these conditions in Latino communities. The project has four aims:  1) develop a better understanding of the impact of the school environment, and a large school district's policies that influence this environment, on asthma and obesity; 2) develop a common language between 'professionals' and 'community members/parents' that will be used to activate, then resonate with school administrators; 3) evaluate two different models of community organizing in a school-based setting; and 4) open lines of communication and working partnerships between schools and community health providers.

"Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sedentary lifestyle is directly associated with disease and reduced quality of life. While the general United States population is suffering from an epidemic of sedentary lifestyle, Latinos are even more sedentary than their non-Hispanic white counterparts. Notably, Latinos suffer from greater rates of morbidity and mortality of conditions associated with being sedentary than non-Hispanic whites. One concern is that due to cultural artifacts, socioeconomic circumstances, and language barriers, Latinos have limited access to public health interventions that promote active lifestyles. Modern behavioral informatics interventions that use theory-based computer-run expert systems show great promise to provide more effective interventions for hard-to-reach populations at lower cost. The present application is in response to PA-04-153, 'Health Disparities Among Minority and Underserved Women.' We aim to both culturally and linguistically modify an evidence-based, inidvidually tailored intervention, founded on the Transtheoretical Model and Social Cognitive Theory, to target sedentary Latinas. This print-based, expert system intervention has been developed and tested by Dr. Bess Marcus and her team, who have spent 18 years developing programs to increase physical activity in sedentary adults. The study will involve two phases: 1) a formative research period in which 100 Latinas will be recruited to provide data on how to modify the current tailored intervention to be culturally congruent and 2) a pilot randomized trial with 80 recruited Latinas to test the modified intervention against off-the-shelf bilingual health educational materials for Latinas. The formative research phase will involve an iterative process of qualitative data collection and intervention modification, with: 1) translation from English to Spanish; 2) an initial round of exploratory focus groups to obtain data on unique themes to include in the modified intervention; 3) a second round of confirmatory focus groups to examine responses to modified intervention materials; and 4) a series of intensive individual cognitive interviews to examine readability and comprehension, consistency of perception of materials with theory, and conceptual integrity of the intervention materials across English and Spanish. The pilot study will provide data on feasibility as well as on effect size of the modified intervention to inform a future clinical trial. Secondary analyses will explore differences in intervention effect based on levels of acculturation and of ethnic identity.             ",Seamos Activas: Increasing Activity Among Latinas,7536959,R21NR009864,"['Data Collection ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Behavioral ', ' Female ', ' Comprehension ', ' Guidelines ', ' Focus Groups ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Future ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Heart ', ' sedentary ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Physical activity ', ' Language ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Printing ', ' Staging ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' instrument ', ' Condition ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' size ', ' interest ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Informatics ', ' Participant ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Modeling ', ' Readability ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Communities ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' Computers ', ' ']",NINR,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R21,2007,194200,0.059834713854874585
"Promoting physical activity among Latino youth: A community-based approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to conduct a program of clinical community-based participatory research aimed at prevention of chronic disease through the promotion of physical activity with underserved and disenfranchised populations. Historically, these populations have been omitted from clinical research and are at high risk for chronic illness. Immediate goals are to expand current research skills, incorporate a community-based participatory research approach, and work with a Latino community. To achieve these goals, a focused career development plan is proposed to1) acquire advanced theoretical knowledge and practical experience with conducting community-based participatory research aimed at physical activity promotion in Latino youth, 2) gain literacy in Latino culture, Spanish language, and knowledge of Latino health issues, and 3) gain advanced skills and mentored experience in designing and implementing interventions aimed at physical activity promotion. Research to be conducted will use a community-based participatory approach to address the lack of physical activity in Latino adolescents, which is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHO), the leading cause of death in the US. Latinos comprise 13% of the population of the US and are the fastest growing minority group. Latino youth bear a greater burden of CHD risk factors, compared with white non-Hispanic youth. In order to improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes for Latino youth, we must address risk factors early in adolescence. Increasing physical activity is one way to reduce CHD risk in Latino youth. There is a paucity of research directed toward promoting physical activity among Latino youth and this study addresses this critical gap. Thus, the specific aims of the proposed study are to 1) assess and evaluate community resources for physical activity, and 2) develop and assess the feasibility of a culturally appropriate physical activity intervention for middle school Latino adolescents. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for the community assessment. Based on the analysis of the community assessment data, the physical activity intervention will be finalized in partnership with the community. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for the feasibility assessment.

There are pervasive ethnic and racial disparities in mental health service utilization and in mental health status yet the underlying causes of these disparities are poorly understood. This application seeks to establish an Advanced Center for Latino and Mental Health Systems Research (Advanced Latino Disparities Center) that focuses on understanding the factors affecting mental health service disparities in Latinos and generating research and knowledge to eliminate them. This Center will be part of the Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research (CMMHR) and is built on the strengths and learning experiences of our ongoing NIMH-funded Latino Research Program Project (LRPP). The proposed Center is a five-year project, structured around two large (R01) and two smaller (pilot) projects. We support the research with an Administrative and Methods Core led by experienced, multidisciplinary investigators, build on the collaborative partnerships that characterize our past work, and mentor and develop junior investigators to become new experts in health disparities research. The overall aims of the Advanced Latino Disparities Center are to: (1) Establish an administrative structure that supports a synergistic core of researchers to conduct mental health service disparities research; (2) Institute a methodological and statistical component as an integral part of the proposed program; (3) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary mental health services disparity research program with a focus on four program areas: (a) Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos; (b) Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos; (c) Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care; and (d) Dialog with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements; (4) Continue developing a cadre of young investigators committed to mental health service disparities research with Latino populations; and (5) Disseminate the research findings to inform policy decisions and practice, contribute to stakeholders' knowledge, and encourage future disparities research in Latino communities.      Project 1: Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos. The goal of this project is to develop and test a mixed methods approach to helping clinicians in public health psychiatric settings decrease clinical uncertainty by more accurately diagnosing patients with diverse cultural backgrounds and improving the matching of clinical services to the needs of Latinos. Our approach combines methods from cultural anthropology with statistical methods and psychiatric epidemiology. The specific aims of this study focus on generating improved cultural formulations and diagnostic accuracy using information from qualitative and quantitative perspectives, iterating between the methods in a complementary fashion. The specific aims are to: Aim 1: Identify the information about symptoms and cultural and social context gathered in the initial diagnostic interview, that clinicians use to make determinations about three disorders: major depression, drug abuse and alcohol abuse; Aim 2: Use data from an epidemiological survey to assess the potential sensitivity and specificity of the clinical determinations identified in Aim1 in detecting the underlying diagnosis. We will test the hypothesis that clinical diagnosis is less accurate for Latino than non-Latino white patients; Aim 3: Assess clinician and patient reactions to the recommended improvements to diagnostic assessments developed in Aim 2. Using focus groups and consensus panels, prioritize the kinds of information to be collected to improve diagnostic determinations in safety net settings. Aim 4: Apply the findings of Aim 3 to make concrete recommendations to improve the efficiency and fairness of diagnostic decisions for Latino and non-Latino white population groups.      Project 2: Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos. In this research we propose to conduct statistical analyses of data from a large quasi-experimental project (ACCESS) and a 2-stage modified Delphi technique to generate recommendations for the modification of assertive community treatment (ACT) when applied to Latino and other severely mentally ill homeless (SMIH) minority populations. The ACCESS study compared the outcome effects of ""augmented"" ACT (i.e., ACT + quality improvement intervention) and standard ACT, and found no evidence of differences. Utilizing a disparities framework, advanced statistical methods, and a 2-stage Delphi method, we propose to conduct service and outcomes disparities research aimed at generating information with clinical or programmatic utility for Latinos. The proposed analyses will generate new evidence on service use and outcomes for Latino SMIH persons treated with ACT, and will broaden our understanding of the effects of quality improvement interventions for   Latinos. Findings will be integrated with expert opinion to generate recommendations regarding ACT for Latino SMIH persons.   The study has four aims:   1. To test for disparities in service use for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   2. To test for outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   3. To estimate the impact of observed service disparities on observed outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons   4. To integrate results from analyses of service and outcome disparities for Latinos, a literature review, and expert opinion, and generate recommendations to improve ACT for Latino SMIH persons.      Pilot 1: Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care. Parental belief that the child needs mental health care has been found to be the most significant factor associated with service use in non-minority populations. The results of several studies suggest that Latino parents are less likely than European Americans to recognize and/or label their children's behavior as a mental health problem requiring intervention. It is not clear which factors explain this lower recognition of mental health problems by Latino parents, and consequently the lower utilization of mental health services by this group. Differences between providers and parents in their views of children's impairments and/or the kind of problems that require treatment may also explain some of the lower utilization of mental health services among Latino children. There is some evidence that providers from different cultures differ in their impairment ratings of children. However, there is no research that examines whether non-Latino white providers as compared to Latino providers are more likely to rate the same children as impaired, nor is there any research that assesses the extent to which parents and providers from different cultures differ in their ratings of children's impairment. This pilot aims to investigate parental and provider beliefs about what is impaired behavior, the severity of the behavior, and the need for treatment in a sample of Mexican Americans, island Puerto Rican and non-Latino providers and parents. We will examine the ratings of providers and parents from the three ethnic groups using case vignettes of children with different levels of impairment and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Vignettes will be developed utilizing information obtained through secondary analyses of two clinical data sets. We will test the hypothesis that Puerto Rican and Mexican American parents and providers rate the children described in the vignettes as less impaired as compared to non-Latino white parents and providers. We further hypothesize that greater acculturation in Mexican American parents will be associated with less variation between Mexican American and non- Latino white parents in their impairment ratings of the vignettes. We also expect greater congruence in the impairment ratings and perceptions of need for services among parents and providers within the same ethnic group.      Pilot 2: Dialogue with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements. A disproportionate number of Latinos rely on free or reduced price care making them more vulnerable to the impact of shrinking resources on the quality of care at safety net healthcare systems. The main goal of this pilot is to identify quality improvements by increasing the Latino community voice in a safety net mental healthcare system. We will explore system concerns (disproportionate impact of economic constraints on quality of care and low levels of participation in mental health services among Latinos) by including members of the Latino community in a participatory research process together with representatives of a healthcare system (i.e., psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, senior hospital administrators, clinic coordinators). In addition, this resulting collaborative stakeholder group will jointly identify leverage points in the community and health care system to launch quality improvements.    The aims of the pilot are to:   1. Consult multiple stakeholders to identify community, client, administrative, provider and mental health care system barriers to access and quality mental health services for Latino patients.   2. Selecting barriers identified from Aim 1, conduct policy implementation analyses that ground the participatory process in a clear, shared understanding of the legal, administrative and fiscal constraints on efforts aimed at quality improvements.   3. Use the information generated in Aims 1 and 2 to launch a participatory process with multiple stakeholders to identify leverage points for mental health care system change. As part of this research, we will generate hypotheses to be tested in the context of community and/or systems interventions and their prospective evaluation in R01 applications.   We intend to use qualitative methods and policy implementation analysis to address these aims. We will build a collaborative, multidisciplinary community and mental health systems advisory group to assist in the identification and design of these quality improvements. By the end of this pilot, we will have a sustainable group of advisors who will work together in the future implementation of the quality improvements identified through this pilot work.      Center Core:         ",Advanced Center for Latino and MH Systems Research,7261835,P50MH073469,[''],NIMH,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,P50,2007,1346715,0.11234412173972488
"Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Studies in the U.S. and elsewhere have generally shown that higher social position is strongly associated with lower mortality risks and better health at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder. However, the situation for the Latino population is more complex. Despite the poorer socioeconomic status of Latinos, their infant and adult mortality rates are generally the same as or lower than those for whites, a pattern often referred to as the ""Hispanic Paradox."" A second puzzle pertains to findings in the literature that, despite this mortality advantage, Latino survey respondents are more likely than those in other ethnic groups to rate their overall health as fair or poor. Our preliminary research based on three data sets reveals yet another paradox: for a broad range of health-related behaviors and health outcomes, the social gradients in health for Latino youth and adults are weak or virtually non-existent in contrast to the generally strong gradients for whites. In the proposed project, we will systematically investigate the relationships between socioeconomic status, immigrant status, health behavior, and health outcomes for Latinos in the United States. Although our principal focus will be the Latino population, we will also examine these relationships for other ethnic groups. In addition, we will investigate associations between socioeconomic status and health outcomes in Mexico, which is the largest sending country for Latino immigrants in the U.S. Data for the analysis will come from waves 1 and 2 of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, from the National Health Interview Survey, and from the Mexican Encuesta Nacional de Salud. Our overall goal is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Latino health.              ",Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos,7260972,R01HD051764,"['Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Birth Weight ', ' age group ', ' ethnic difference ', ' drinking ', ' Social status ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' National origin ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Range ', ' Rate ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' residence ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' Central American ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mexican ', ' Legal Status ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marmota ', ' Marmots ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mexico ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Native Americans ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2007,470165,0.211954763785763
"Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dramatic increase in the population of Latinos-the largest minority group in the U.S.-over the last decade and challenges Latinos face in terms of accessing health care in the U.S. make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors and issues that affect Latino health disparities in the U.S. Our long term goal is to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventually elimination of Latino health disparities, especially those in HIV/AIDS and substance abuse. The objectives of the proposed P20 Center of Excellence-NCMHD Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the U.S. -are: (1) Conducting original research exploring the role of behavioral and social factors contributing to or influencing minority health and health disparities; (2) Translating research findings into effective interventions for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (3) Conducting original research exploring the efficacy of a full range of health promotion and information dissemination approaches for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (4) Establishing innovative partnerships between academic institutions and community groups/organizations; and (5) to increase the number of researchers and professionals who are committed to eliminating health disparities, especially those from minority and medically under-served populations. The proposed Center will expand the activities of two R24 Centers of Excellence in Florida International University (FIU), the largest four-year Hispanic Serving Institution in the U.S. It will build on an existing collaboration between FIU and two community-based organizations: SPECTRUM, the oldest and largest non-profit substance abuse treatment agency in South Florida, and Miami Behavioral Health Center, the largest provider of behavioral healthcare services to Latinos in Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: administrative, research, research education/ training, and community engagement/outreach. Its study population will be the Latino population in Miami-Dade County, the only county in the U.S. with an immigrant majority, 97 percent of which are Latinos. The contributions of the Center are significant, since the Center will fill in the need to conduct research that bridges HIV/AIDS and substance use, enhance trust between the researchers and the community, and produce a cadre of scientists conducting research on health disparities-especially those from Latino and other minority and medically under-served populations. Relevance to Public Health: The Center is expected to lead to development and refinement of culturally relevant and evidence-based HIV prevention strategies available to HIV-uninfected/ infected individuals and users of substances among the Latinos, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS and substance abuse epidemics in the U.S.          ",Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States,7304011,P20MD002288,[''],NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,P20,2007,1303329,0.022119022647667984
"Trabajando Juntos: Working for Health Disparity Reduction among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Southeastern Untied States has the fastest growing Latino population in the country and at the same time carries a disproportionate HIV/AIDS disease burden. Few efficacious HIV prevention interventions exist for Latinos, with none for recently arrived, monolingual (Spanish-speaking), less-acculturated Latino men who are settling in the Southeast. We propose a 2-year study (R21) to expand and test the efficacy of a culturally relevant intervention designed to reduce risk of HIV infection among immigrant Latino men. The intervention is based on the social cognitive theory and the theory of empowerment education. This study has used and will continue to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach throughout all phases of the research process. A randomized controlled design is proposed to test the efficacy of the interventions. A total of 120 Latino men will be recruited in rural NC and informed consent obtained. All eligible and willing men will complete an initial baseline assessment designed to measure current sexual behavior, and cultural, social, and psychological influences on sexual behavior and healthcare utilization. Participants will then be randomized to an HIV prevention intervention or a cancer prevention education comparison intervention. All participants will complete identical assessments at immediate post intervention and 3-month follow-up. Participants in the HIV prevention interventions, relative to their peers in the comparison group, are anticipated to demonstrate (a) increased self-reported use of condoms during sexual intercourse; (b) increased self-reported utilization of HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD) counseling, testing and treatment services; (c) greater knowledge of HIV risk behaviors and prevention strategies; (d) increased norm perception scores supporting risk-reduction strategies; (e) more positive attitudes toward condom use; (f) increased self-efficacy to use and assert the use of condoms; (g) increased sense of mastery scores; and (h) enhanced communication and sexual negotiation skills. This study will advance the field of HIV prevention research through the development of 3 important and much needed ""products"" that will fill existing gaps: (a) a culturally relevant Spanish-language intervention designed to reduce HIV/AIDS risk among recently arrived, less-acculturated Latino men that will be ready for further implementation and larger scale testing; (b) a deeper understanding of HIV risk among Latino men; and (c) insight into a research partnership process that includes lay community members, AIDS service organizations (ASOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), 3 universities, and a broad spectrum of other partners.              ",Trabajando Juntos: Working for Health Disparity Reduction among Latinos,7234935,R21MH079827,"['Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' comparison group ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' Counseling ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Prevention education ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Depth ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interviewer ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' newspaper article ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Score ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Manuscripts ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' ']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2007,206580,0.04268838966323732
"A Cultural Approach to the Study of Latino Parenting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Latino children and adolescents have higher rates of behavior problems and academic failure compared with chilldren and adolescents from other ethnic groups. The developmental outcomes of Latino youth appear to be related to family functioning variables and to parenting practices in particular. Yet, there is limited understanding of Latino parenting and of the relation between Latino parenting and child outcomes. The purpose of this application is to study Latino parenting of preschool-aged children using a culturally informed framework of parenting that focuses on cultural childrearing values and Latina mothers' value-driven behavior in different cultural contexts, as well as a traditional framework of parenting, to predict child behavior and pre-academic functioning. An understanding of parenting practices that are predictive of child behavioral and pre-academic functioning in Latino preschoolers is critical in the design of preventive interventions that enhance functioning among Latino preschoolers by promoting specific parenting practices.  Such services are key in addressing mental health disparities seen between Latino and non-Latino youth. To accomplish these goals, a career development plan will focus on training for the Candidate in: 1) culturally informed research, 2) ethnographic methodology, 3) behavioral observation and coding of parentchild interactions, and 4) statistical methods and analyses related to measure development, qualitative studies, model testing, and prevention trials. Training will be accomplished through formal coursework, individual tutorials with mentors and consultants, and participation in conferences on relevant topjcs.  Moreover, this training plan will be supplemented by a research plan that includes a qualitative study of cultural childrearing values that will be used for measurement development and a quantitative study of Latino parenting, assessed from both cultural and traditional perspectives, and its relation to child behavior and pre-academic functioning.

"Behavior & Clinical Trials Participation in HIV+ Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through this research career development award, I will complete the initial steps to establish myself as an independent researcher in HIV/AIDS behavioral research to reduce health disparities in Latino communities infected with HIV. Using didactic and mentored learning, I will improve upon my existing behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative research skills to address the issue of low participation in HIV/AIDS clinical trials in Latino communities. Proportionate representation of minority populations in research trials is necessary to improve research capacity to generalize results to diverse populations infected with HIV. My specific research aims are to: 1) Describe and understand the attitudes, beliefs, cultural and social norms, provider and system influences relating to entry into clinical trials in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and 2) Develop and pilot test an intervention for improving understanding and acceptance of HIV clinical trials participation by HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos and their communities. The theoretical framework of the research plan is the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (Andersen, Aday, et al.). The research plan will be carried out in three phases, each phase linked to a career development objective and activity. In Phase 1 I will conduct formative research using qualitative methods with HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, including design and implementation of an in-depth interview protocol and focus group questions to explore factors to consider in attempting to improve clinical trials participation in Latino populations. In Phase 2 I will carry out qualitative analysis, develop a social cognitive model of participation in research, develop research hypotheses, and develop and pilot test a survey to test the social cognitive model in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos. In Phase 3 I will validate the survey, analyze and report outcomes, design and pilot-test a behavioral intervention to increase clinical trials participation in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and finally, use intervention pilot data to prepare an R01 proposal to the NIH to promote participation of HIV+ Latinos in clinical trials.

"San Diego Partnership to Reduce Diabetes and CVD in Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The San Diego Latino Research Center of Excellence is a tri-lateral collaboration that seeks to promote and expedite research that improves cardiovascular disease outcomes in low-income Latinos living in the border region of San Diego. San Diego State University (SDSU) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) represent two large research intensive universities, one with a school of public health and the other with a school of medicine, but both with experience and interest in community based research and training. The San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC) is a large, predominantly Latino-serving community health center that provides services to disadvantaged patients. Together, these organizations will build on existing relationships to conduct epidemiologic, behavioral, and genetic research in an effort to improve the care being delivered to indigent Latinos at risk for and having CVD. Investigators and staff at these three institutions will be referred to as the San Diego Partnership Staff. The San Diego Latino Research Center of Excellence proposes to focus on the disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors experienced by low-income Latinos living in the San Diego border region. The center will conduct rigorous community-based research that will primarily lead to reduction in disparities for disadvantaged populations, and at the same time provide improved service to the community, answer important biomedical questions, build research capacity in the community, and stimulate and train investigators in CVD disparities. The goals of the San Diego Latino Center of Excellence are: Goal 1: Conduct research that will reduce CVD disparities in a predominantly Latino community through culturally and linguistically appropriate applications of the ADA and NCEP guidelines Goal 2: Strengthen the infrastructure for minority health and health disparities research and training at SDSU, UCSD, and SYHC Goal 3: Increase the number of minority investigators engaged in cardiovascular disparities research Goal 4: Strengthen the research infrastructure at a community site, SYHC, thereby increasing the potential for university-community partnerships in which research is conducted.          ",San Diego Partnership to Reduce Diabetes and CVD in Latinos,7304182,P20MD002293,[''],NIMHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,P20,2007,1188698,0.03267431653586671
"UPR-CHA Research Center of Excellence: Making a Difference for Latino Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Health and health service disparities are pervasive in asthma and mental disorders in both Puerto Rico and the United States among Latinos. The causes for these disparities are poorly understood and effective interventions to eliminate these disparities are needed. The mission of the proposed University of Puerto Rico-Cambridge Health Alliance Research Center of Excellence (UPR-CHA RCE) is to conduct research on Latino health and health care disparities, specifically mental disorders, substance abuse and asthma, and to generate and test models of improved service delivery to eliminate these disparities. The UPR-CHA RCE will build on the strengths and experiences of the UPR-CHA EXPORT Center. The UPR-CHA RCE is led by an experienced and diverse research team with a long history of collaboration and commitment to the study of service disparities among minority populations. The Center is structured around a Research, Administrative and Training Core. Based on a conceptual model developed by the group, three research projects will test multi-level interventions at the provider, individual/family and policy level to reduce health services disparities in mental disorders and pediatric asthma (Projects 1 and 2) and provide data to understand the magnitude of substance abuse treatment disparities and the social and economic burden of these disparities (Project 3). Two pilot projects open up new areas of research on disparities, one focusing on a low-cost prevention intervention for mothers of asthmatic children at risk for depression (Pilot 1) and another on documenting disparities in the treatment of mentally ill nursing home residents (Pilot 2). The five aims of the proposed UPR-CHA-RCE are to: 1) Establish an administrative structure that integrates and centralizes a synergistic core of researchers into a single interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary enterprise by pulling together resources, leadership, and expertise from the mainland US and Puerto Rico. 2) Continue to establish, strengthen and maintain partnerships with organizations and communities for conducting original and relevant research leading to improvement in Latino health and in eliminating service disparities. 3) Enhance research and training activities of the ongoing UPR-CHA EXPORT Center to mentor and develop Latino investigators and to increase the number of minority researchers who conduct health disparities research. 4) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary asthma and mental health services and intervention research program to increase our understanding of and eliminate and/or reduce service disparities of Latinos in all stages of their life cycle. 5) Disseminate and integrate the product of these efforts to inform policy decisions, clinical practice and community partners, and orient health service systems to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services.          ",UPR-CHA Research Center of Excellence: Making a Difference for Latino Health,7277374,P60MD002261,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,P60,2007,1509873,-0.04248120976134596
"Promotion of Physical Activity in the Latino Community The San Diego Prevention Research Center (SDPRC) is an interdisciplinary academic-community partnership committed to conducting research and education in promoting physical activity (PA) and improving the health of Latinos. The community partner organization is the San Ysidro Health Clinic Inc., (SYHC), located near the San Diego/Tijuana border, and our Community Committee, of which the SYHC is a member, is the Enhancing Family Resources Collaborative (EFRC). The SDPRC comprises collaboration between a School of Public Health (SPH, San Diego State University; SDSU), a School of Medicine with a residency in Preventive Medicine (University of California at San Diego; UCSD), and a Department of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences (ENS; SDSU). Thus, training efforts will be readily accessible not only to practitioners but also to SPH and ENS graduate (masters and doctoral) and undergraduate students, and to UCSD preventive medicine residents. As a result of the training and education activities, the SDPRC will create a network of experienced professionals that will serve the needs of San Ysidro and other South Bay communities with respect to PA promotion, program evaluation, and community building. The core research activities we propose include conducting a community-wide needs and assets assessment for PA in San Ysidro, and developing and evaluating a community-wide walking initiative for adults and a soccer games/leagues enhancement program for children and adolescents. The SDPRC plans to create a PRC Latino Health Network as both a web- and meeting-based activity that will provide a forum for sharing strategies with the national PRC network to empower Latinos to reduce health disparities particular to their communities. The web site will have measurement materials, resource guides, community partner links, and conference information.

"Perceived Racism and Cancer Risk Among Latino Immigrant Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Latino immigrant men, and studies have found that the longer they reside in the US, the greater their risk for cancer. North Carolina's economic opportunities have attracted the fastest growing Latino population in the US. Nevertheless, these men encounter environmental stressors of language barriers, immigration laws, and racism. Coping with such stressors can lead to behaviors that increase their cancer risk, such.as alcohol consumption and tobacco use. Contributing to the problem is a health care system that has been unable to keep pace with Latino immigrant men's rapidly growing needs. Studies have shown that perceived racism is positively associated with cigarette use and alcohol consumption, and inversely associated with use of health care. The objective of the proposed study is to reveal the pathways underlying the relationship between perceived racism and cancer risk behaviors among Latino immigrant men in rural North Carolina. The study will be guided by the Ecosocial Model of racism and health and the Biopsychosocial Model of racism as a stressor. The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1: To describe the prevalence of perceived racism among Latino immigrant men. Aim 2: To assess the relationship between perceived racism and cancer risk behaviors of tobacco use, alcohol consumption, and health care utilization among Latino immigrant men. Aim 3: To determine whether the relationship between perceived racism and cancer risk behaviors is moderated by Latino immigrant men's personal coping responses and sense of mastery. The study proposes to conduct confirmatory factor analysis and linear regression modeling, using cross- sectional data collected for the study, Men as Navigators for Health and Hombres Manteniendo Bienestar y Relaciones Saludables. The proposed research will contribute to the NCI goal of identifying and addressing underlying causes of racial and ethnic cancer disparities. Findings will contribute to both the theoretical and empirical literature by testing hypotheses about two pathways linking perceived racism and cancer risk behaviors, as well as proposed moderators of these relationships. Moreover, the results from our research can inform future cancer prevention and control interventions to reduce the negative effects of perceived racism for Latinos in new immigrant destinations.              ",Perceived Racism and Cancer Risk Among Latino Immigrant Men,7323427,F31CA130136,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Incidence ', ' India ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Language ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Literature ', ' Rural ', ' Legal Status ', ' Policies ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' North Carolina ', ' Perception ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Frequency ', ' Behavior ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' cancer risk ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Cigarette ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' binge drinking ', ' episodic drinking ', ' binge alcohol consumption ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Destinations ', ' Emotional ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' coping ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2007,29230,0.058927755151560686

"A Cultural Approach to the Study of Latino Parenting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Latino children and adolescents have higher rates of behavior problems and academic failure compared with chilldren and adolescents from other ethnic groups. The developmental outcomes of Latino youth appear to be related to family functioning variables and to parenting practices in particular. Yet, there is limited understanding of Latino parenting and of the relation between Latino parenting and child outcomes. The purpose of this application is to study Latino parenting of preschool-aged children using a culturally informed framework of parenting that focuses on cultural childrearing values and Latina mothers' value-driven behavior in different cultural contexts, as well as a traditional framework of parenting, to predict child behavior and pre-academic functioning. An understanding of parenting practices that are predictive of child behavioral and pre-academic functioning in Latino preschoolers is critical in the design of preventive interventions that enhance functioning among Latino preschoolers by promoting specific parenting practices.  Such services are key in addressing mental health disparities seen between Latino and non-Latino youth. To accomplish these goals, a career development plan will focus on training for the Candidate in: 1) culturally informed research, 2) ethnographic methodology, 3) behavioral observation and coding of parentchild interactions, and 4) statistical methods and analyses related to measure development, qualitative studies, model testing, and prevention trials.

"Intervention to improve end of life care for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer is the leading cause of death among Latinos in the US and the absolute number of individuals at risk for, and dying from cancer will increase over the coming decades as the population ages. Within this aging population, Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority group. Although little research exists, there is evidence that Latino cancer caregivers have worse outcomes including more depression and poorer quality of life in bereavement. Studies have shown that hospices can provide better care and less stress for the caregiver than hospitals or unsupported home care. Unfortunately hospice use is low and only 2% to 6% of hospice patients are Latino.      We are currently completing a qualitative study comparing Latino and White bereaved cancer caregivers who have used hospice to those who have not. Our results indicate that cultural factors, such as a collectivist orientation and social networks are key determinants of hospice use. In addition, there is a lack of knowledge about hospice services and little awareness of the availability of services. Based on these results, we have designed an intervention using a trained bi-lingual and bi-cultural Lay Health Worker (LHW) to deliver information and counseling about ""care that may be needed in the future"" and to help families navigate to hospice services, other community resources, and grief support. The LHW will also do community education to enhance understanding of hospice services.      The study is designed to pilot the feasibility of prospectively enrolling 40 terminally ill patients and their caregivers. Patients and families will be identified by collaborating physicians. Twenty will receive the intervention; they will be compared to 20 who will receive usual care and print materials. Outcome measures include: number of days of hospice use; knowledge of hospice; satisfaction with care. In addition we will perform a process evaluation of the intervention including both qualitative and quantitative analyses of process variables. Evidence of a feasible and effective intervention will provide a model of care for use with Latinos nationally and with other ethnic groups.      Physicians will be asked to identify Latino patients with ECOG scores of 3 or 4 and to ask if they or their caregiver would agree to talk with the study RA. The patient can be at any stage of care, including curative treatment, and need not be ready for hospice referral. The information provided by the study is about ""the availability of care in the future, should it be needed."" Prognosis and current treatment will not be discussed. One reason for this approach is that we don't want to interfere with the current plan of care; the other is that we are sensitive to the cultural norms of not discussing prognosis with patients.       Our RA will introduce the study and ask for participation. If the family agrees, they will be interviewed at baseline then selected for an intervention or control group. In the intervention group, they will be assigned a trained bi-lingual and bi-cultural counselor to inform them about future care options: palliative care, home hospice, inpatient hospice. They will also receive counseling, if necessary, and help accessing hospice care and other community services such as Meals on Wheels. The counselor will be available throughout caregiving and during bereavement, helping caregivers access bereavement services. Control families will receive usual care and written materials.             ",Intervention to improve end of life care for Latinos,7459187,U01CA114593,"['Counseling ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dramatic increase in the population of Latinos-the largest minority group in the U.S.-over the last decade and challenges Latinos face in terms of accessing health care in the U.S. make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors and issues that affect Latino health disparities in the U.S. Our long term goal is to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventually elimination of Latino health disparities, especially those in HIV/AIDS and substance abuse. The objectives of the proposed P20 Center of Excellence-NCMHD Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the U.S. -are: (1) Conducting original research exploring the role of behavioral and social factors contributing to or influencing minority health and health disparities; (2) Translating research findings into effective interventions for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (3) Conducting original research exploring the efficacy of a full range of health promotion and information dissemination approaches for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (4) Establishing innovative partnerships between academic institutions and community groups/organizations; and (5) to increase the number of researchers and professionals who are committed to eliminating health disparities, especially those from minority and medically under-served populations. The proposed Center will expand the activities of two R24 Centers of Excellence in Florida International University (FIU), the largest four-year Hispanic Serving Institution in the U.S. It will build on an existing collaboration between FIU and two community-based organizations: SPECTRUM, the oldest and largest non-profit substance abuse treatment agency in South Florida, and Miami Behavioral Health Center, the largest provider of behavioral healthcare services to Latinos in Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: administrative, research, research education/ training, and community engagement/outreach. Its study population will be the Latino population in Miami-Dade County, the only county in the U.S. with an immigrant majority, 97 percent of which are Latinos. The contributions of the Center are significant, since the Center will fill in the need to conduct research that bridges HIV/AIDS and substance use, enhance trust between the researchers and the community, and produce a cadre of scientists conducting research on health disparities-especially those from Latino and other minority and medically under-served populations. Relevance to Public Health: The Center is expected to lead to development and refinement of culturally relevant and evidence-based HIV prevention strategies available to HIV-uninfected/ infected individuals and users of substances among the Latinos, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS and substance abuse epidemics in the U.S.          ",Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States,7504019,P20MD002288,[''],NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,P20,2008,1862226,0.022119022647667984
"UPR-CHA Research Center of Excellence: Making a Difference for Latino Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Health and health service disparities are pervasive in asthma and mental disorders in both Puerto Rico and the United States among Latinos. The causes for these disparities are poorly understood and effective interventions to eliminate these disparities are needed. The mission of the proposed University of Puerto Rico-Cambridge Health Alliance Research Center of Excellence (UPR-CHA RCE) is to conduct research on Latino health and health care disparities, specifically mental disorders, substance abuse and asthma, and to generate and test models of improved service delivery to eliminate these disparities. The UPR-CHA RCE will build on the strengths and experiences of the UPR-CHA EXPORT Center. The UPR-CHA RCE is led by an experienced and diverse research team with a long history of collaboration and commitment to the study of service disparities among minority populations. The Center is structured around a Research, Administrative and Training Core. Based on a conceptual model developed by the group, three research projects will test multi-level interventions at the provider, individual/family and policy level to reduce health services disparities in mental disorders and pediatric asthma (Projects 1 and 2) and provide data to understand the magnitude of substance abuse treatment disparities and the social and economic burden of these disparities (Project 3). Two pilot projects open up new areas of research on disparities, one focusing on a low-cost prevention intervention for mothers of asthmatic children at risk for depression (Pilot 1) and another on documenting disparities in the treatment of mentally ill nursing home residents (Pilot 2). The five aims of the proposed UPR-CHA-RCE are to: 1) Establish an administrative structure that integrates and centralizes a synergistic core of researchers into a single interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary enterprise by pulling together resources, leadership, and expertise from the mainland US and Puerto Rico. 2) Continue to establish, strengthen and maintain partnerships with organizations and communities for conducting original and relevant research leading to improvement in Latino health and in eliminating service disparities. 3) Enhance research and training activities of the ongoing UPR-CHA EXPORT Center to mentor and develop Latino investigators and to increase the number of minority researchers who conduct health disparities research. 4) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary asthma and mental health services and intervention research program to increase our understanding of and eliminate and/or reduce service disparities of Latinos in all stages of their life cycle. 5) Disseminate and integrate the product of these efforts to inform policy decisions, clinical practice and community partners, and orient health service systems to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services.          ",UPR-CHA Research Center of Excellence: Making a Difference for Latino Health,7495960,P60MD002261,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,P60,2008,2126175,-0.04248120976134596
"Familias Fuertes: Outreach to Latino families with a child coping with cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this Phase I Small Business Innovation Research application, KDH Research and Communication (KDHRC) proposes to develop and evaluate a culturally relevant outreach program to provide education and support for Latino families with children coping with cancer. More specifically, the program, tentatively entitled Familias Fuertes (Strong Families) [FF], will address two different health situations. First, FF will provide specific materials for Latino families with a child diagnosed with pediatric cancer. Second, FF will supply materials to help Latino families with a child who has a parent, caregiver, or other close family member with cancer. To reduce institutional barriers to care that are often experienced by Latinos due to language, insurance, immigration status and other challenges, FF will be implemented in a two step process. First, community based health organizations that serve Latinos will recruit and train protomoras, using the FF training guide, a product that provides a blueprint for systematic, evidence-based training sessions and associated outreach tools like brochures, flipcharts, and flyers. Second, these promotoras will conduct outreach to Latino families with a child coping with cancer, reaching them at critical points in the cancer diagnosis, treatment, and coping processes of the children. In that way, FF will 1) provide a bridge between the family in its community and formalized medical systems of care to reduce the risk of negative medical outcomes, and 2) promote family communication about the disease to decrease distress and increase effective coping in children and adults. Latinos experience significant health disparities and barriers to care when coping with cancer. FF will support families with children, a vulnerable population presently unserved by existing programs. In Phase I, KDHRC will conduct formative research with families with children coping with cancer, health care providers, community advocates, and promotoras to inform the content and design of the training guide and promotora tools. A prototype of these products will be created, and a feasibility study will assess the extent to which the prototype is appropriate, relevant, and has the potential for successful implementation. The study will also lay the foundation for further product development and evaluation in Phase II. Latinos, particularly children, with cancer are more likely to receive a diagnosis at a later stage than non- Hispanic whites. This difference has been attributed to access-related barriers, such as uninsured or underinsured status, and linguistic/cultural communication difficulties with health care providers. Because of these rates and the health challenges that they may represent, there has been a strong call from the public health and medical fields to develop culturally appropriate initiatives to improve the spectrum of cancer-related health care for Latinos in the United States. Public Health Relevance: To that end, Familias Fuertes program will support Latino families with a child coping with cancer, and will provide an evidence-based, replicable, and easily disseminated program that may reduce health disparities and barriers to care in this population.          ",Familias Fuertes: Outreach to Latino families with a child coping with cancer,7538052,R43CA135984,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Geographic state ', ' US State ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Advocate ', ' Belief System ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Communication Research ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Malignant neoplasm of brain ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Brain ', ' Brain Cancer ', ' Family ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Germ cell tumor ', ' Germ Cell Neoplasms ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Insurance ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Distress ', ' Ritual compulsion ', ' Rituals ', ' leukemia ', ' Blood (Leukemia) ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Trust ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' pediatric neoplasm/cancer ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Medical Errors ', ' Medical Mistakes ', ' programs ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' United States ', ' Writing ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Bone neoplasms ', ' Osseous Tumor ', ' Osseous Neoplasm ', ' Bone Tumor ', ' care delivery ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' genetic testing ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' outreach program ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Underinsured ', ' Uninsured ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' health organization ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Communication ', ' Communication Barriers ', ' Communities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Instruction ', ' cost ', ' care systems ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' leukemia/lymphoma ', ' lymphoma/leukemia ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' community based service ', ' advocacy organizations ', ' prototype ', ' ']",NCI,"KDH RESEARCH AND COMMUNICATION, INC.",R43,2008,106531,0.14902317324817635
"Promoting physical activity among Latino youth: A community-based approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to conduct a program of clinical community-based participatory research aimed at prevention of chronic disease through the promotion of physical activity with underserved and disenfranchised populations. Historically, these populations have been omitted from clinical research and are at high risk for chronic illness. Immediate goals are to expand current research skills, incorporate a community-based participatory research approach, and work with a Latino community. To achieve these goals, a focused career development plan is proposed to1) acquire advanced theoretical knowledge and practical experience with conducting community-based participatory research aimed at physical activity promotion in Latino youth, 2) gain literacy in Latino culture, Spanish language, and knowledge of Latino health issues, and 3) gain advanced skills and mentored experience in designing and implementing interventions aimed at physical activity promotion. Research to be conducted will use a community-based participatory approach to address the lack of physical activity in Latino adolescents, which is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHO), the leading cause of death in the US. Latinos comprise 13% of the population of the US and are the fastest growing minority group. Latino youth bear a greater burden of CHD risk factors, compared with white non-Hispanic youth. In order to improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes for Latino youth, we must address risk factors early in adolescence. Increasing physical activity is one way to reduce CHD risk in Latino youth. There is a paucity of research directed toward promoting physical activity among Latino youth and this study addresses this critical gap. Thus, the specific aims of the proposed study are to 1) assess and evaluate community resources for physical activity, and 2) develop and assess the feasibility of a culturally appropriate physical activity intervention for middle school Latino adolescents. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for the community assessment. Based on the analysis of the community assessment data, the physical activity intervention will be finalized in partnership with the community. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for the feasibility assessment. The feasibility assessment will include a process evaluation, identification of barriers to participation by the adolescents in the intervention, and an outcomes evaluation.          ",Promoting physical activity among Latino youth: A community-based approach,7496097,K23NR010557,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Purpose ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' literacy ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Development Plans ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' United States ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Belief ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2008,127278,0.10910782961775123
"San Diego Partnership to Reduce Diabetes and CVD in Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The San Diego Latino Research Center of Excellence is a tri-lateral collaboration that seeks to promote and expedite research that improves cardiovascular disease outcomes in low-income Latinos living in the border region of San Diego. San Diego State University (SDSU) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) represent two large research intensive universities, one with a school of public health and the other with a school of medicine, but both with experience and interest in community based research and training. The San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC) is a large, predominantly Latino-serving community health center that provides services to disadvantaged patients. Together, these organizations will build on existing relationships to conduct epidemiologic, behavioral, and genetic research in an effort to improve the care being delivered to indigent Latinos at risk for and having CVD.

"Barriers to Care & Treatment Practices in HIV+ Latinos in US-Mexico Border Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify barriers to HIV care among HIV- positive Latinos in the U.S.-Mexico border region. California ranks among the top five states with highest numbers of Latino AIDS cases and Latinos comprise 66% of reported HIV cases in San Diego County's southern region. Latinos face substantial barriers to HIV care and enter care at advanced stages of HIV disease, but reasons for this are poorly understood, and could involve issues related to stigma, HIV treatment optimism and use of traditional, complementary and/or alternative medicines (CAM). We will assess barriers to HIV care and care practices among Latinos in the U.S.-Mexico border region applying Andersen & Aday's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use as our conceptual framework to study environmental, structural, behavioral and societal factors. We propose a community-based binational collaborative study that builds on existing academic-community partnerships and employs quantitative and qualitative methods to address aims. Aim 1: To assess binational health care seeking behavior and HIV treatment utilization, including access to ARVs and use of CAM (e.g. folk medicine, herbal medicine) among HIV-positive Latinos who currently reside in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico or San Diego, CA. Aim 2: To determine specific barriers to HIV care, including manifestations of HIV-related stigma, mobility and spirituality/religiosity among HIV-positive Latinos who reside in Tijuana and San Diego. Aim 3: To explore provider and system-level barriers to continuity of HIV care and receipt of ARVs in HIV-positive Latinos within the health care delivery context of both sides of the US- Mexico border. To address Aims 1 and 2 we will conduct a quantitative study, based on interviewer- administered surveys with 200 HIV-positive persons (100 participants recruited from both sides of border). We will use descriptive and multivariate logistic regression statistical analyses to test specific hypotheses. To meet Aim 3, we will purposively sample 20 providers/administrators, conducting in-depth interviews on experiences with patient barriers to HIV care. Following Grounded Theory methods, data collection and analysis will include development and revision of interview guides using constant comparison method. The investigator team will independently code and reach consensus on interview coding to reflect themes/issues, accounts of behaviors, and opinions on organizational/system characteristics that influence health services. This study will decrease health disparities in HIV-positive Latinos through improved understanding of HIV care-seeking behavior; HIV care practices}including CAM use; development of community-based and culturally-relevant research methods and measures; and advancing efforts to positively impact care delivery in Latinos living in the US- Mexico border region and in other US Latino populations living with HIV/AIDS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify barriers to HIV care among HIV- positive Latinos in the U.S.-Mexico border region. Latinos face substantial barriers to HIV care and enter care at advanced stages of HIV disease, but reasons for this are poorly understood, and could involve issues related to stigma, HIV treatment optimism and use of traditional, complementary and/or alternative medicines (CAM). The proposed study will assess barriers to HIV care and care practices among HIV-positive Latinos in the U.S.-Mexico border region applying Andersen & Aday's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use as our conceptual framework to study environmental, structural, behavioral and societal factors.          ",Barriers to Care & Treatment Practices in HIV+ Latinos in US-Mexico Border Region,7426983,R21MH084266,"['Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Geographic state ', ' US State ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Folk Medicine ', ' traditional medicine (folk) ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Herb ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Depth ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Alternative Medicine ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' optimism ', ' postiive attitude ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Medicine ', ' Herbal Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mexico ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Stigmata ', ' Consensus ', ' Solutions ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vitamins ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' care seeking ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Administrator ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2008,190864,0.0010460392288906474
"Community Health Worker Diabetes RCT for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos experience a 50-100% higher burden of illness and mortality due to diabetes than White Americans. Diabetes, if inadequately controlled, produces major social and economic costs for affected families and the larger community. While there is recent evidence of success for diabetes lifestyle interventions, there is a need for new and creative approaches that maintain the intensity of these interventions and at the same time meet the needs of under-resourced racial/ethnic communities. Community health worker (CHW) interventions have shown great promise, particularly among poor communities of color, but there is a need to evaluate these interventions for their effectiveness and potential cost-savings. The overall aim of this community-based randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) is to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of a CHW-led intervention designed to promote diabetes self-management and other healthy behaviors, compared to an enhanced usual- care (EUC) control group, among Latino residents of Detroit with physician-diagnosed type-2 diabetes. We will test the hypothesis that our CHW intervention led by trained Family Health Advocates (FHA) will increase knowledge of diabetes, increase physical activity, healthy dietary practices, improve diabetes self- management, and decrease HbA1c among Latino participants with diabetes. We propose to randomly assign 260 participants to either the FHA or EUC group. Participants assigned to the EUC group will receive invitations to community activities that are free and open to the public, including a general diabetes education class, physical activity classes, and healthy eating activities. The FHA group also will receive these invitations and the additional services of FHAs, who assist participants through a four-step, empowerment behavior change model and five-session diabetes education curriculum. FHAs also provide support services, including one-on-one education, accompanying clients on clinic visits, and linking clients to needed health care and other resources. Additionally, we hypothesize that the FHA group participants will have improved levels of patient activation compared to the EUC control group, as measured by health service utilization, completion of recommended tests, self-efficacy, and patient-provider communication. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of community health worker services that contribute to achievement of behavioral and clinical outcomes versus the EUC control group is hypothesized. This intervention will be implemented in collaboration with REACH Detroit, an existing partnership between university and community organizations which aims to reduce racial and ethnic disparities by preventing diabetes and its complications. The REACH Detroit and its collaborators have a successful record of community-based participatory intervention research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research aims to demonstrate how a culturally tailored community health worker intervention can be a cost-effective method for assisting Latinos with diabetes to improve their self-management skills and health status. If successful, the methods and results of this research will assist communities and health providers and systems to include community health worker services within their systems of care. Ultimately, we believe such interventions hold one key to eliminating disparities in diabetes care and diabetes complications.       ",Community Health Worker Diabetes RCT for

"Implementing the Health for All Model with Latino Community of Kansas City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to longstanding health disparities in multiple minority populations, there is a deep need for innovative strategies and models that change community conditions and promote health equity. The aim of this proposal is to implement the culturally and contextually-adapted Health for All model, a promising pilot-tested intervention to change community conditions to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes risk factors in the Latino community in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas. Using community-based participatory research methods, the project will assure that community members are equal and essential partners in developing, implementing and evaluating interventions focused on reducing health disparities. This project builds on the long-term relationship between the KU Work Group for Community Health and Development, at the University of Kansas, and the Kansas City - Chronic Disease Coalition. The community intervention will be comprised of several key components and elements, including: the creation of a clear vision and mission, logic model, and action plan adapted for the local Latino community; the assurance of intensive supports for the plan's implementation; the hiring of community mobilizers; documentation and review of activities for feedback and improvement; and shared responsibility among scientific and community partners for the project's development, implementation, and evaluation. Community-determined long-term objectives focus on related risk behaviors (e.g., increasing daily fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity levels, cholesterol screen levels, and decreasing obesity). This will be achieved through the implementation of an action plan that puts in place new programs, policies and practices at the community and system levels that affect risk for CVD and diabetes in the Latino community and among organizations that serve Latinos. Data will be collected through ongoing documentation of all project-related activities and accomplishments facilitated by the coalition and its partners and annual surveys of self-reported behaviors among the targeted population. A panel design will be used with additional cross sectional samples for which pre-post comparisons will be conducted. The CBPR study will expand the science and practice of how communities create conditions that promote health and healthy equity.          ",Implementing the Health for All Model with Latino Community of Kansas City,7493828,R24MD002780,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Data ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Depth ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Kansas ', ' Logic ', ' Policies ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Mission ', ' Missouri ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Daily ', ' Condition ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' metropolitan ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Communities ', ' community intervention ', ' self reported behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R24,2008,573536,0.07343565726151571
"Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will test the causal effects of social capital on levels and inequalities of children's social and cognitive development during the early elementary years. Social capital here refers to trust and shared expectations embedded in social networks of parents, teachers, and children. For young children, social capital operates primarily through their relationships with their parents, enhancing development through mechanisms of social support and social control. Children from low-income Latino families are a special focus of the study. The research design is experimental: social capital will be manipulated through a well-tested intervention Families and Schools Together (FAST) that will enhance the social capital among parents, teachers, and children through an intensive after-school program and a 2-year follow-up program. The study will include 52 schools in Milwaukee and San Antonio (about 208 teachers and 3,120 first graders and their families), with half the schools randomly selected for the intervention and half serving as controls. The experimental design will permit a strong test of the causal role of social capital. The project will also involve an implementation study intended to illuminate the processes by which social capital is generated and affects child development. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, drawing on sociology, psychology, and economics,and it reflects an ecological perspective that crosses boundaries between families and schools. The study thus responds to the call for research on the Science and Ecology of Early Development. Key aspects of child development will be assessed, including (a) social skills and problem behavior from standardized behavioral ratings by parents; (b) the latter plus academic competence as rated by teachers; and (c) grade retention, attendance rates, and third-grade reading and mathematics scores from school records. Social capital will be measured with repeated surveys of teachers and parents that address the extent of social networks, parent involvement, trust, and shared expectations among parents, between parents and schools, and between parents and children. Data will be analyzed with multilevel statistical models that take account of variation at the individual and school levels of analysis.RELEVANCE. Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, and among the most disadvantaged. Latino families often perceive a sense of distance from the school system, which can create barriers to their children's academic and social development, important dimensions of public health. This study will yield practical as well as scientific insights into the value of increased social capital for development of children among a variety of demographic groups, and particularly those from low-income Latino families.          ",Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study,7373457,R01HD051762,"['expectation ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Absenteeism ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Low income ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Social Network ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Interview ', ' teacher ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Inequality ', ' Mathematics ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Parents ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Condition ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Development ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Sociology ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Dimensions ', ' Score ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' intervention program ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2008,757964,0.06808873208394509
"Behavior & Clinical Trials Participation in HIV+ Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through this research career development award, I will complete the initial steps to establish myself as an independent researcher in HIV/AIDS behavioral research to reduce health disparities in Latino communities infected with HIV. Using didactic and mentored learning, I will improve upon my existing behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative research skills to address the issue of low participation in HIV/AIDS clinical trials in Latino communities. Proportionate representation of minority populations in research trials is necessary to improve research capacity to generalize results to diverse populations infected with HIV. My specific research aims are to: 1) Describe and understand the attitudes, beliefs, cultural and social norms, provider and system influences relating to entry into clinical trials in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and 2) Develop and pilot test an intervention for improving understanding and acceptance of HIV clinical trials participation by HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos and their communities. The theoretical framework of the research plan is the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (Andersen, Aday, et al.). The research plan will be carried out in three phases, each phase linked to a career development objective and activity. In Phase 1 I will conduct formative research using qualitative methods with HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, including design and implementation of an in-depth interview protocol and focus group questions to explore factors to consider in attempting to improve clinical trials participation in Latino populations. In Phase 2 I will carry out qualitative analysis, develop a social cognitive model of participation in research, develop research hypotheses, and develop and pilot test a survey to test the social cognitive model in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos. In Phase 3 I will validate the survey, analyze and report outcomes, design and pilot-test a behavioral intervention to increase clinical trials participation in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and finally, use intervention pilot data to prepare an R01 proposal to the NIH to promote participation of HIV+ Latinos in clinical trials.

"Greater Denver Latino Cancer Prevention/Control Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The Latino Research and Policy Center, under PI Dr. Estevan Flores, at the University of Colorado at Denver, will expand its SPN to 30 Latino community based organizations and create the Colorado Front Range Latino Community Network (CFRLCN) in 10 Colorado counties, representing 80 percent of all Colorado Latinos and 83 percent of all Latino cancer cases.  The Network will be composed of health clinics and agencies serving Latinos including Denver Health Medical Center, the CU Health Sciences' Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Disease Prevention Division, and La Salud Health Clinics. The CFRLCN builds on previous work on cancer awareness, education and research activities in the Latino population like our SPN's five pilot projects. Future activities include efforts in awareness, prevention and early detection of breast, cervical, prostate, lung (including smoking cessation) and colorectal cancers.  Colorado Cancer Registry data has been used to target specific cancers for intervention in these 10 counties.  Education and prevention activities include Dia de la Mujer Latina, and a colorectal education/prevention outreach program.  The CFRLCN will reduce cancer health disparities in the 10 counties and will embark, in Years 1 and 2, on a community participatory research framework in intervention research to achieve these aims.  This work will lead to development of interventions and pilot proposals and large scale interventions (R01s).  Three plans address separately junior investigator training, health disparities community research, and education and prevention projects.  A separate pilot research proposal by Dr. Tim Byers (PI) will test sustainable navigation and support for the Hispanic cancer survivor.

"Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos have been consistently found to underutilize formal mental health services and are less likely to receive quality care for mental and behavioral disorders compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Efficacious treatments for mental disorders are available, but dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions for Latinos is limited. An annual LBHI Conference for five years is proposed to improve the exchange of scientific findings and enhance collaboration among 1000 attendees annually representing researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, consumers and their families. The conference sessions will provide findings on evidence-based interventions across the life span, and sessions that address the contextual issues (e.g., culturally and linguistically relevant program approaches, community characteristics, system-level barriers and interventions), and process issues (e.g. engagement strategies) that are critical to addressing the disparities in service access and utilization. The Conferences are a collaborative effort between LBHI and national, state, county and community partners to provide a forum for the exchange of information on the distinctive mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, and resilience issues of Latinos. They are also designed to provide a forum for developing strategic partnerships and community participation to support research capacity relevant to Latino mental health. The Conferences support, as attendees, investigators at the pre-doctoral, post-doctoral, and early investigator levels to stimulate their interest in Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the Latino organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. LBHI will convene a national strategic planning process to identify the: 1) information needs of target attendees regarding evidence-based interventions in Latino service settings and 2) effective dissemination and implementation mechanisms to address conference objectives. Barriers to effective dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions into Latino service settings will be addressed by the Conferences through the following objectives. The annual Conference will: (1) result in enhanced capacity of researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, and consumers and their families to collaborate in the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions in service settings for Latinos; (2) increase the capacity to conduct research in Latino mental health service settings through the formation of strategic partnerships, community engagement and the submission of NIH grant applications; and, (3) increase investigator knowledge and interest in addressing Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. The Latino Behavioral Health Institute (LBHI) proposes a series of five annual conferences designed to enhance behavioral health services to the Latino community, the fastest growing, and yet in terms of mental health services, the most underserved population in the United States. The purpose of the annual conferences is to facilitate the exchange of scientific information and clinical experience among the over 1000 attendees including researchers, clinicians, policy makers, consumers and their families. By improving the link between research and clinical practice, the LBHI conferences aim to provide participants with the knowledge and skills to decrease the disparities in mental health service utilization among Latinos and improve the overall health and mental health of the largest minority group in the United States.          ",Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference,7499526,R13MH078724,"['racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Purpose ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Advocate ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Family ', ' Support of Research ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Institutes ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Recovery ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' United States ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' interest ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' County ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Latino ', ' behavioral health ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' ']",NIMH,LATINO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INSTITUTE,R13,2008,24275,0.04588180892476277

"Latin American Cancer Research Coalition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   There are approximately 36 million Latinos known to be living in the US and by the year 2050, this group will constitute 25 percent of the US population.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death among this rapidly growing minority group.  Latinos have higher rates of cancers with infectious etiologies.  For other sites, despite lower incidence, Latinos have more late stage, higher mortality-to-incidence ratios, and inferior survival compared to Caucasians.  Lifestyle changes associated with acculturation may also increase future cancer risks.  The greater Washington-Baltimore tri-state region (DC, Maryland, Virginia) has one of the largest urban concentrations of Latinos in the US. Latinos in this region are predominately of Central and South American ancestry, recently immigrated, un-insured, and largely monolingual.  We developed the Latin American Cancer Research Coalition (LACRC) as a local network in DC to address the unique needs of this Latino subgroup.  In our first 4 years, the LACRC trained community coordinators, students, and faculty, submitted an R25T post-doctoral grant, obtained pilot and career development funding, published manuscripts, and disseminated results with the community.  We propose to expand the LACRC as a regional network.  The overarching goal of this regional network is to document, understand, and reduce cancer disparities in Latinos.  LACRC partners include multidisciplinary, multicultural, and bilingual researchers and staff from the Washington Hospital Center/Cancer Institute, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown university, 19 community safety net clinics across our region, the Inova-Fairfax community hospital, and consultants and advisors from the regional Departments of Health and Tumor Registries, the Council of Latino Agencies, the National Council of La Raza, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the regional NCI Cancer Information Service and Spanish-language support line, the ACS, and others.  LACRC aims are to:  1) enhance capacity, especially for data collection on Latinos; 2) use the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to guide participatory research and use results to inform education, training, and planning; and 3) obtain funding, influence policy, and evaluate progress.  The structure of the LACRC is ideally suited as a platform for bridging the gaps between research discovery and delivery, and developing, evaluating, and disseminating culturally competent interventions across the spectrum of cancer control.  Our approach should be broadly portable to reducing disparities in other US urban Latino communities         ",Latin American Cancer Research Coalition,7414874,U01CA114593,"['Costs and Benefits ', '

"Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Studies in the U.S. and elsewhere have generally shown that higher social position is strongly associated with lower mortality risks and better health at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder. However, the situation for the Latino population is more complex. Despite the poorer socioeconomic status of Latinos, their infant and adult mortality rates are generally the same as or lower than those for whites, a pattern often referred to as the ""Hispanic Paradox."" A second puzzle pertains to findings in the literature that, despite this mortality advantage, Latino survey respondents are more likely than those in other ethnic groups to rate their overall health as fair or poor. Our preliminary research based on three data sets reveals yet another paradox: for a broad range of health-related behaviors and health outcomes, the social gradients in health for Latino youth and adults are weak or virtually non-existent in contrast to the generally strong gradients for whites. In the proposed project, we will systematically investigate the relationships between socioeconomic status, immigrant status, health behavior, and health outcomes for Latinos in the United States. Although our principal focus will be the Latino population, we will also examine these relationships for other ethnic groups. In addition, we will investigate associations between socioeconomic status and health outcomes in Mexico, which is the largest sending country for Latino immigrants in the U.S. Data for the analysis will come from waves 1 and 2 of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, from the National Health Interview Survey, and from the Mexican Encuesta Nacional de Salud. Our overall goal is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Latino health.              ",Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos,7409021,R01HD051764,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Range ', ' Rate ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' residence ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' Central American ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mexican ', ' Legal Status ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marmota ', ' Marmots ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mexico ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Native Americans ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Birth Weight ', ' age group ', ' ethnic difference ', ' drinking ', ' Social status ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' National origin ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2008,431053,0.211954763785763
"Trabajando Juntos: Working for Health Disparity Reduction among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Southeastern Untied States has the fastest growing Latino population in the country and at the same time carries a disproportionate HIV/AIDS disease burden. Few efficacious HIV prevention interventions exist for Latinos, with none for recently arrived, monolingual (Spanish-speaking), less-acculturated Latino men who are settling in the Southeast. We propose a 2-year study (R21) to expand and test the efficacy of a culturally relevant intervention designed to reduce risk of HIV infection among immigrant Latino men. The intervention is based on the social cognitive theory and the theory of empowerment education. This study has used and will continue to use a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach throughout all phases of the research process. A randomized controlled design is proposed to test the efficacy of the interventions. A total of 120 Latino men will be recruited in rural NC and informed consent obtained. All eligible and willing men will complete an initial baseline assessment designed to measure current sexual behavior, and cultural, social, and psychological influences on sexual behavior and healthcare utilization. Participants will then be randomized to an HIV prevention intervention or a cancer prevention education comparison intervention. All participants will complete identical assessments at immediate post intervention and 3-month follow-up. Participants in the HIV prevention interventions, relative to their peers in the comparison group, are anticipated to demonstrate (a) increased self-reported use of condoms during sexual intercourse; (b) increased self-reported utilization of HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD) counseling, testing and treatment services; (c) greater knowledge of HIV risk behaviors and prevention strategies; (d) increased norm perception scores supporting risk-reduction strategies; (e) more positive attitudes toward condom use; (f) increased self-efficacy to use and assert the use of condoms; (g) increased sense of mastery scores; and (h) enhanced communication and sexual negotiation skills. This study will advance the field of HIV prevention research through the development of 3 important and much needed ""products"" that will fill existing gaps: (a) a culturally relevant Spanish-language intervention designed to reduce HIV/AIDS risk among recently arrived, less-acculturated Latino men that will be ready for further implementation and larger scale testing; (b) a deeper understanding of HIV risk among Latino men; and (c) insight into a research partnership process that includes lay community members, AIDS service organizations (ASOs), community-based organizations (CBOs), 3 universities, and a broad spectrum of other partners.              ",Trabajando Juntos: Working for Health Disparity Reduction among Latinos,7407398,R21MH079827,"['Counseling ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Prevention education ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Depth ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interviewer ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Policies ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' newspaper article ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Public Health Practice ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Score ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Manuscripts ', ' condoms ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Human Sexual Intercourse ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' comparison group ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' ']",NIMH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2008,159591,0.04268838966323732
"Promotion of Physical Activity in the Latino Community The San Diego Prevention Research Center (SDPRC) is an interdisciplinary academic-community partnership committed to conducting research and education in promoting physical activity (PA) and improving the health of Latinos. The community partner organization is the San Ysidro Health Clinic Inc., (SYHC), located near the San Diego/Tijuana border, and our Community Committee, of which the SYHC is a member, is the Enhancing Family Resources Collaborative (EFRC). The SDPRC comprises collaboration between a School of Public Health (SPH, San Diego State University; SDSU), a School of Medicine with a residency in Preventive Medicine (University of California at San Diego; UCSD), and a Department of Exercise and Nutrition Sciences (ENS; SDSU). Thus, training efforts will be readily accessible not only to practitioners but also to SPH and ENS graduate (masters and doctoral) and undergraduate students, and to UCSD preventive medicine residents. As a result of the training and education activities, the SDPRC will create a network of experienced professionals that will serve the needs of San Ysidro and other South Bay communities with respect to PA promotion, program evaluation, and community building. The core research activities we propose include conducting a community-wide needs and assets assessment for PA in San Ysidro, and developing and evaluating a community-wide walking initiative for adults and a soccer games/leagues enhancement program for children and adolescents. The SDPRC plans to create a PRC Latino Health Network as both a web- and meeting-based activity that will provide a forum for sharing strategies with the national PRC network to empower Latinos to reduce health disparities particular to their communities. The web site will have measurement materials, resource guides, community partner links, and conference information.

"Redes En Accion: National Latino Cancer Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Action is urgently needed to address persistent disparities in cancer control and prevention that harm the health of Latino populations.  To meet this need, we propose a comprehensive set of research, education, and training activities to be carried out at the national level and in regional centers in California, Florida, New York, and Texas by an established network of investigators uniquely qualified to understand issues from the perspectives of their diverse populations and to serve as leaders and role models for influencing change and fostering a new generation of Latino scientists and policy advocates.  Research activities will include: 1) development of disparity-related pilot projects for proposals to obtain independent NCI funding for Latino scientists; 2) national, regional, and local policy studies analyzing factors influencing disparities in access to cancer control and prevention, and the capacities of advocates concerned with this issue; and 3) multi-site evaluation of an experimental intervention designed to improve women's capacities for navigating health care systems that provide cancer screening and care.  Education activities at the national and regional levels will include:  1) multi-modal public education and outreach and 2) professional education and outreach for clinical providers and for organizations concerned with policies that influence access to cancer screening and care.  Training activities will consist of mentoring and pilot research support for students and junior scientists developing careers in research aimed at understanding and reducing disparities that affect the cancer health of Latinos.  This work will be conducted in three phases.  In Phase I, network infrastructure will be established, administrative and communications systems go online, and preparations for Phase II activation completed.

"Redes En Accion: National Latino Cancer Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Action is urgently needed to address persistent disparities in cancer control and prevention that harm the health of Latino populations.  To meet this need, we propose a comprehensive set of research, education, and training activities to be carried out at the national level and in regional centers in California, Florida, New York, and Texas by an established network of investigators uniquely qualified to understand issues from the perspectives of their diverse populations and to serve as leaders and role models for influencing change and fostering a new generation of Latino scientists and policy advocates.  Research activities will include: 1) development of disparity-related pilot projects for proposals to obtain independent NCI funding for Latino scientists; 2) national, regional, and local policy studies analyzing factors influencing disparities in access to cancer control and prevention, and the capacities of advocates concerned with this issue; and 3) multi-site evaluation of an experimental intervention designed to improve women's capacities for navigating health care systems that provide cancer screening and care.  Education activities at the national and regional levels will include:  1) multi-modal public education and outreach and 2) professional education and outreach for clinical providers and for organizations concerned with policies that influence access to cancer screening and care.  Training activities will consist of mentoring and pilot research support for students and junior scientists developing careers in research aimed at understanding and reducing disparities that affect the cancer health of Latinos.  This work will be conducted in three phases.  In Phase I, network infrastructure will be established, administrative and communications systems go online, and preparations for Phase II activation completed.

"Defining Latino Intercultural Competence and Its Relationship to Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The application entitled Defining Latino Intercultural Competence and Its Relationship to Depression, proposes to examine Latino intercultural competence, or proficiency of skills that facilitate cultural interactions, and its influence on psychological distress. This innovative construct will advance the research on mental health disparities by examining the underlying processes that link culture and psychopathology. The result will be a comprehensive account of cultural experiences that directly influence psychological functioning. The specific aims of the study are: 1) to refine Latino intercultural competence through the development of a culturally-appropriate measure, and 2) to examine the ability of the constructed Latino intercultural competence scale to predict mental health and depression. To accomplish the first specific aim, three sub-goals are outlined including: a) generation of items and development of the Latino intercultural competence scale; b) examination of reliability and exploration of factor structure; and c) analysis of validity. A methodological tool known as cultural consensus analysis, adapted from the field of medical anthropology, will be used to describe the features of Latino intercultural competence (aim sub-goal 1a). Examining scale reliability and validity will be accomplished via survey procedures to determine internal consistency and checks for content (aim sub-goal 1b-1c). The second specific aim will entail completing paper-and-pencil questionnaires to investigate the impact of Latino intercultural competence on mental health while accounting for orthogonal dimensions and subfactors of acculturation. The current project will add to current conceptualizations of adaptation and determine the skills-based factors that protect Latinos from negative psychological consequences. Such a focus is readily transferable to culturally-effective intervention efforts that ease recovery and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As mental health problems, particularly depression, are a significant and growing problem in the Latino community, the relevance of this project is evident in its contributions to understanding the underlying aspects of Latino culture that serve to buffer individuals from negative psychological consequences. The information from the study will be used to facilitate more effective ways of dealing with psychological difficulties that take advantage of the resources that are characteristic of the Latino way of life. This will lay the groundwork for creating better management strategies of prevalent health and mental health problems in the Latino.                ",Defining Latino Intercultural Competence and Its Relationship to Depression,7469701,R21MH077735,"['Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Range ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Language ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Persons ', ' Immigrant ', ' Reliance ', ' Paper ', ' Anthropology ', ' tool ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' Buffers ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Prevention ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' psychological distress ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' protective effect ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NIMH,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R21,2008,194895,0.12865448958259615
"Advanced Center for Latino and MH Systems Research    DESCRIPTIONS (provided by applicant):       Center Core. There are pervasive ethnic and racial disparities in mental health service utilization and in mental health status yet the underlying causes of these disparities are poorly understood. This application seeks to establish an Advanced Center for Latino and Mental Health Systems Research (Advanced Latino Disparities Center) that focuses on understanding the factors affecting mental health service disparities in Latinos and generating research and knowledge to eliminate them. This Center will be part of the Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research (CMMHR) and is built on the strengths and learning experiences of our ongoing NIMH-funded Latino Research Program Project (LRPP). The proposed Center is a five-year project, structured around two large (R01) and two smaller (pilot) projects. We support the research with an Administrative and Methods Core led by experienced, multidisciplinary investigators, build on the collaborative partnerships that characterize our past work, and mentor and develop junior investigators to become new experts in health disparities research. The overall aims of the Advanced Latino Disparities Center are to: (1) Establish an administrative structure that supports a synergistic core of researchers to conduct mental health service disparities research; (2) Institute a methodological and statistical component as an integral part of the proposed program; (3) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary mental health services disparity research program with a focus on four program areas: (a) Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos; (b) Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos; (c) Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care; and (d) Dialog with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements; (4) Continue developing a cadre of young investigators committed to mental health service disparities research with Latino populations; and (5) Disseminate the research findings to inform policy decisions and practice, contribute to stakeholders' knowledge, and encourage future disparities research in Latino communities.      Project 1: Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos. The goal of this project is to develop and test a mixed methods approach to helping clinicians in public health psychiatric settings decrease clinical uncertainty by more accurately diagnosing patients with diverse cultural backgrounds and improving the matching of clinical services to the needs of Latinos. Our approach combines methods from cultural anthropology with statistical methods and psychiatric epidemiology. The specific aims of this study focus on generating improved cultural formulations and diagnostic accuracy using information from qualitative and quantitative perspectives, iterating between the methods in a complementary fashion. The specific aims are to: Aim 1: Identify the information about symptoms and cultural and social context gathered in the initial diagnostic interview, that clinicians use to make determinations about three disorders: major depression, drug abuse and alcohol abuse; Aim 2: Use data from an epidemiological survey to assess the potential sensitivity and specificity of the clinical determinations identified in Aim1 in detecting the underlying diagnosis. We will test the hypothesis that clinical diagnosis is less accurate for Latino than non-Latino white patients; Aim 3: Assess clinician and patient reactions to the recommended improvements to diagnostic assessments developed in Aim 2. Using focus groups and consensus panels, prioritize the kinds of information to be collected to improve diagnostic determinations in safety net settings. Aim 4: Apply the findings of Aim 3 to make concrete recommendations to improve the efficiency and fairness of diagnostic decisions for Latino and non-Latino white population groups.      Project 2: Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos. In this research we propose to conduct statistical analyses of data from a large quasi-experimental project (ACCESS) and a 2-stage modified Delphi technique to generate recommendations for the modification of assertive community treatment (ACT) when applied to Latino and other severely mentally ill homeless (SMIH) minority populations. The ACCESS study compared the outcome effects of ""augmented"" ACT (i.e., ACT + quality improvement intervention) and standard ACT, and found no evidence of differences. Utilizing a disparities framework, advanced statistical methods, and a 2-stage Delphi method, we propose to conduct service and outcomes disparities research aimed at generating information with clinical or programmatic utility for Latinos. The proposed analyses will generate new evidence on service use and outcomes for Latino SMIH persons treated with ACT, and will broaden our understanding of the effects of quality improvement interventions for   Latinos. Findings will be integrated with expert opinion to generate recommendations regarding ACT for Latino SMIH persons.   The study has four aims:   1. To test for disparities in service use for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   2. To test for outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   3. To estimate the impact of observed service disparities on observed outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons   4. To integrate results from analyses of service and outcome disparities for Latinos, a literature review, and expert opinion, and generate recommendations to improve ACT for Latino SMIH persons.      Pilot 1: Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care. Parental belief that the child needs mental health care has been found to be the most significant factor associated with service use in non-minority populations. The results of several studies suggest that Latino parents are less likely than European Americans to recognize and/or label their children's behavior as a mental health problem requiring intervention. It is not clear which factors explain this lower recognition of mental health problems by Latino parents, and consequently the lower utilization of mental health services by this group. Differences between providers and parents in their views of children's impairments and/or the kind of problems that require treatment may also explain some of the lower utilization of mental health services among Latino children. There is some evidence that providers from different cultures differ in their impairment ratings of children. However, there is no research that examines whether non-Latino white providers as compared to Latino providers are more likely to rate the same children as impaired, nor is there any research that assesses the extent to which parents and providers from different cultures differ in their ratings of children's impairment. This pilot aims to investigate parental and provider beliefs about what is impaired behavior, the severity of the behavior, and the need for treatment in a sample of Mexican Americans, island Puerto Rican and non-Latino providers and parents. We will examine the ratings of providers and parents from the three ethnic groups using case vignettes of children with different levels of impairment and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Vignettes will be developed utilizing information obtained through secondary analyses of two clinical data sets. We will test the hypothesis that Puerto Rican and Mexican American parents and providers rate the children described in the vignettes as less impaired as compared to non-Latino white parents and providers. We further hypothesize that greater acculturation in Mexican American parents will be associated with less variation between Mexican American and non- Latino white parents in their impairment ratings of the vignettes. We also expect greater congruence in the impairment ratings and perceptions of need for services among parents and providers within the same ethnic group.      Pilot 2: Dialogue with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements. A disproportionate number of Latinos rely on free or reduced price care making them more vulnerable to the impact of shrinking resources on the quality of care at safety net healthcare systems. The main goal of this pilot is to identify quality improvements by increasing the Latino community voice in a safety net mental healthcare system. We will explore system concerns (disproportionate impact of economic constraints on quality of care and low levels of participation in mental health services among Latinos) by including members of the Latino community in a participatory research process together with representatives of a healthcare system (i.e., psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, senior hospital administrators, clinic coordinators). In addition, this resulting collaborative stakeholder group will jointly identify leverage points in the community and health care system to launch quality improvements.    The aims of the pilot are to:   1. Consult multiple stakeholders to identify community, client, administrative, provider and mental health care system barriers to access and quality mental health services for Latino patients.   2. Selecting barriers identified from Aim 1, conduct policy implementation analyses that ground the participatory process in a clear, shared understanding of the legal, administrative and fiscal constraints on efforts aimed at quality improvements.   3. Use the information generated in Aims 1 and 2 to launch a participatory process with multiple stakeholders to identify leverage points for mental health care system change. As part of this research, we will generate hypotheses to be tested in the context of community and/or systems interventions and their prospective evaluation in R01 applications.   We intend to use qualitative methods and policy implementation analysis to address these aims. We will build a collaborative, multidisciplinary community and mental health systems advisory group to assist in the identification and design of these quality improvements. By the end of this pilot, we will have a sustainable group of advisors who will work together in the future implementation of the quality improvements identified through this pilot work.      Center Core:         ",Advanced Center for Latino and MH Systems Research,7450744,P50MH073469,[''],NIMH,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,P50,2008,1104527,0.11234412173972488
"A Partnership Approach to Reducing HIV Disparities Among Latino Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern United States has the fastest growing Latino population in the country and carries a disproportionate HIV/AIDS disease burden. We propose a 5-year study (R24) to fully implement and rigorously evaluate a piloted lay health advisor (LHA) intervention designed to reduce risk of HIV infection among recently arrived, monolingual, less-acculturated Latino men who are settling in the Southeast. The intervention is based on social cognitive theory and the theory of empowerment education and was developed using community-based participatory research (CBPR). This study is a result of a long-term community-university partnership that has used and will continue to use CBPR throughout all phases of the research process.      A total of 20 Latino soccer teams in rural NC will be randomized to an LHA-led HIV prevention intervention or a delayed-intervention comparison group. One man from each of the intervention teams (n=10) will be nominated by his teammates and selected as an LHA in Year 2. The delayed-intervention teams (n=10) will receive the same intervention in Year 3. Quantitative assessment data will be collected from each LHA and 12 of his teammates from each of the 20 teams at: (1) baseline, (2) immediate postintervention, and (3) 12-month follow-up.      Participants in the HIV prevention intervention, relative to their peers in the delayed-intervention comparison group, are anticipated to demonstrate (1) increased self-reported use of condoms during sexual intercourse and (2) increased self-reported utilization of HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD) counseling, testing, and treatment services.      To further evaluate and explore the intervention, qualitative data will be collected using individual in-depth interviews with LHAs and their teammates. We also will evaluate the CBPR process, using direct observation of partnership meetings, in-depth interviews with partners, and partnership document review.      Products from this study will include (1) a Spanish-language intervention that is ready for dissemination and adaptation, culturally relevant and gender-specific, and designed to reduce HIV risk among recently arrived, less-acculturated Latino men; (2) a deeper understanding of HIV risk and intervention among Latino men that will be reported through briefs, newspaper articles, local and national presentations, and manuscripts; and (3) insight into a research partnership process that includes lay community members, Latino soccer leagues and teams, AIDS service organizations, community-based organizations, 3 universities, and a broad spectrum of other partners.          ",A Partnership Approach to Reducing HIV Disparities Among Latino Men,7493815,R24MD002774,"['Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', '

"Latin American Cancer Research Coalition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   There are approximately 36 million Latinos known to be living in the US and by the year 2050, this group will constitute 25 percent of the US population.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death among this rapidly growing minority group.  Latinos have higher rates of cancers with infectious etiologies.  For other sites, despite lower incidence, Latinos have more late stage, higher mortality-to-incidence ratios, and inferior survival compared to Caucasians.  Lifestyle changes associated with acculturation may also increase future cancer risks.  The greater Washington-Baltimore tri-state region (DC, Maryland, Virginia) has one of the largest urban concentrations of Latinos in the US. Latinos in this region are predominately of Central and South American ancestry, recently immigrated, un-insured, and largely monolingual.  We developed the Latin American Cancer Research Coalition (LACRC) as a local network in DC to address the unique needs of this Latino subgroup.  In our first 4 years, the LACRC trained community coordinators, students, and faculty, submitted an R25T post-doctoral grant, obtained pilot and career development funding, published manuscripts, and disseminated results with the community.  We propose to expand the LACRC as a regional network.  The overarching goal of this regional network is to document, understand, and reduce cancer disparities in Latinos.  LACRC partners include multidisciplinary, multicultural, and bilingual researchers and staff from the Washington Hospital Center/Cancer Institute, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown university, 19 community safety net clinics across our region, the Inova-Fairfax community hospital, and consultants and advisors from the regional Departments of Health and Tumor Registries, the Council of Latino Agencies, the National Council of La Raza, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the regional NCI Cancer Information Service and Spanish-language support line, the ACS, and others.  LACRC aims are to:  1) enhance capacity, especially for data collection on Latinos; 2) use the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to guide participatory research and use results to inform education, training, and planning; and 3) obtain funding, influence policy, and evaluate progress.  The structure of the LACRC is ideally suited as a platform for bridging the gaps between research discovery and delivery, and developing, evaluating, and disseminating culturally competent interventions across the spectrum of cancer control.  Our approach should be broadly portable to reducing disparities in other US urban Latino communities         ",Latin American Cancer Research Coalition,7940361,U01CA114593,"['Costs and Benefits ', '

"Family Care of Older Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos age 65 or older have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and more severe complications from the disease, compared to non-Latino Whites. Latino elders' consequent risks for functional impairment and permanent disability raise questions about their family environment and the role caregivers play in helping them to manage the disease. Studying the family environment is important for addressing and eventually eliminating Latinos' health disparities arising from this chronic disease. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to provide mentored research and professional training to prepare me for a career as a federally-funded, independent investigator on health disparities and aging research in the area of family care of older Latinos. My immediate goals are to 1) develop a research program that characterizes the care of older adults within the Mexican-origin family; and 2) develop proficiency in culturally-relevant interventions for Latino elders and their caregivers. I propose to move my research beyond the female caregiver, toward a family level approach to elder care along one specific health dimension, management of type 2 diabetes. The K01 award builds directly on my current work by 1) including the perspectives of caregiving men and diabetic care-receiving elders; and 2) examining the process of family elder care through observation of caregiver-care receiver dyads (CG-CR dyad) in home settings. I propose three phases of research that culminate in developing and evaluating the feasibility of a CG-CR dyad intervention to improve care receiving Latino elders' diabetes outcomes. The training aspect of this award will provide me with in-depth knowledge in: 1) theory development and measurement of family care of Latino elders; 2) observational methods in home settings; and 3) intervention development and evaluation. My long-term objective is to establish a research trajectory based on theoretical and empirical principles that can be applied in real-world settings to improve the health outcomes of community-dwelling Latino elders. The interdisciplinary mentoring team I put together and my affiliations with the UCLA RCMAR and the UCLA School of Public Health provide the infrastructure to support these endeavors.       RELEVANCE: The proposed research focuses on older Latinos, the largest and second fastest aging sub-population in the United States. Many older Latinos have diabetes and suffer severe consequences from the disease, leading to poor health and disability. This research looks at the role of family caregivers in Latino elders' management of diabetes, one step toward finding ways to improve Latino elders' health in this area.           ",Family Care of Older Latinos with Diabetes,7739728,K01AG033122,"['Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Family Study ', ' Housekeeping ', ' Housework ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Love ', ' Mexican ', ' diabetic ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' One Step ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' glucose monitor ', ' glucose meter ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2009,161721,0.09090717886075113
"A Spanish-Language Intervention to Enhance Routine HIV Patient Care Delivery [CAR     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies and specific Challenge Topic, 06-OD(OBSSR)-101, Using New Technologies to Improve Adherence. Latinos are the fastest-growing group with some of the largest health disparities including HIV. Barriers including language are associated with lower antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence seen among Latinos. There are no evidence-based interventions (randomized trials that significantly reduced viral load and HIV transmission risk to sexual partners - 'positive prevention') delivered in Spanish in routine clinical practice. Our computerized counseling tool (CARE+) in a Phase III trial of English-speaking adults increased ART adherence and reduced viral load and condom use errors. We now propose a longitudinal effectiveness (Phase IV) study to evaluate the impact of computerized counseling in audio-narrated Spanish in a busy urban HIV clinic. This 'CARE+ Spanish' application is responsive to 06-OD(OBSSR)-101, for new technologies to improve adherence in clinical practice. Aim 1: Adapt CARE+ Spanish for use during routine clinical visits by Spanish-speaking HIV clinic attendees using an expert panel to shorten content and add Spanish audio dialects; do usability testing (n<8). Aim 2: Establish real-world utility of 'CARE+ Spanish'. Peer staff will recruit Spanish-speaking adults on ART who will be randomly assigned to intervention (Group A n=250) or risk-assessment control (B, n=250) for 0,3-,6-,9- month sessions; at 12-month session groups will switch to opposite arm (delayed intervention design). Linear and generalized linear mixed effects models will analyze impact on 30-day ART adherence, clinic visit adherence, HIV-1 viral load and sexual risks, and to assess whether any Group A changes are sustained at month 12, among an expected n=400 retained study participants (120 female, 280 male). Aim 3: Explore cultural acceptability of tool among clients and clinic providers. Conduct qualitative exit interviews with patients (n=75) to assess technology uptake factors, cultural/linguistic acceptability, and suggestions for ongoing use among older vs. younger, and US-born vs. foreign-born Latino groups. Conduct two focus groups with providers (n<30) to assess perceived technology barriers/facilitators. Analysis will identify factors affecting acceptability, utilization, and impact. Technology tools like CARE+ present significant opportunities to bridge the health promotion delivery gap, especially if linguistically adapted for often-neglected groups such as Latinos (15 percent of the US population). This Spanish-language computerized counseling intervention will deliver evidence-based treatment support to a highly vulnerable Latino population. We will evaluate effectiveness on medication and clinic visit adherence, and biological outcomes (n=500). We will identify cultural factors related to this technology's acceptability and scalability among Spanish-speaking HIV patients, and providers.               PROJECT NARRATIVE This Spanish-language computerized counseling intervention will deliver evidence-based treatment support to a highly vulnerable Latino population.

"Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will test the causal effects of social capital on levels and inequalities of children's social and cognitive development during the early elementary years. Social capital here refers to trust and shared expectations embedded in social networks of parents, teachers, and children. For young children, social capital operates primarily through their relationships with their parents, enhancing development through mechanisms of social support and social control. Children from low-income Latino families are a special focus of the study. The research design is experimental: social capital will be manipulated through a well-tested intervention Families and Schools Together (FAST) that will enhance the social capital among parents, teachers, and children through an intensive after-school program and a 2-year follow-up program. The study will include 52 schools in Milwaukee and San Antonio (about 208 teachers and 3,120 first graders and their families), with half the schools randomly selected for the intervention and half serving as controls. The experimental design will permit a strong test of the causal role of social capital. The project will also involve an implementation study intended to illuminate the processes by which social capital is generated and affects child development. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, drawing on sociology, psychology, and economics,and it reflects an ecological perspective that crosses boundaries between families and schools. The study thus responds to the call for research on the Science and Ecology of Early Development. Key aspects of child development will be assessed, including (a) social skills and problem behavior from standardized behavioral ratings by parents; (b) the latter plus academic competence as rated by teachers; and (c) grade retention, attendance rates, and third-grade reading and mathematics scores from school records. Social capital will be measured with repeated surveys of teachers and parents that address the extent of social networks, parent involvement, trust, and shared expectations among parents, between parents and schools, and between parents and children. Data will be analyzed with multilevel statistical models that take account of variation at the individual and school levels of analysis.RELEVANCE. Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, and among the most disadvantaged. Latino families often perceive a sense of distance from the school system, which can create barriers to their children's academic and social development, important dimensions of public health. This study will yield practical as well as scientific insights into the value of increased social capital for development of children among a variety of demographic groups, and particularly those from low-income Latino families.

"Community Health Worker Diabetes RCT for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos experience a 50-100% higher burden of illness and mortality due to diabetes than White Americans. Diabetes, if inadequately controlled, produces major social and economic costs for affected families and the larger community. While there is recent evidence of success for diabetes lifestyle interventions, there is a need for new and creative approaches that maintain the intensity of these interventions and at the same time meet the needs of under-resourced racial/ethnic communities. Community health worker (CHW) interventions have shown great promise, particularly among poor communities of color, but there is a need to evaluate these interventions for their effectiveness and potential cost-savings. The overall aim of this community-based randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) is to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of a CHW-led intervention designed to promote diabetes self-management and other healthy behaviors, compared to an enhanced usual- care (EUC) control group, among Latino residents of Detroit with physician-diagnosed type-2 diabetes. We will test the hypothesis that our CHW intervention led by trained Family Health Advocates (FHA) will increase knowledge of diabetes, increase physical activity, healthy dietary practices, improve diabetes self- management, and decrease HbA1c among Latino participants with diabetes. We propose to randomly assign 260 participants to either the FHA or EUC group. Participants assigned to the EUC group will receive invitations to community activities that are free and open to the public, including a general diabetes education class, physical activity classes, and healthy eating activities. The FHA group also will receive these invitations and the additional services of FHAs, who assist participants through a four-step, empowerment behavior change model and five-session diabetes education curriculum. FHAs also provide support services, including one-on-one education, accompanying clients on clinic visits, and linking clients to needed health care and other resources. Additionally, we hypothesize that the FHA group participants will have improved levels of patient activation compared to the EUC control group, as measured by health service utilization, completion of recommended tests, self-efficacy, and patient-provider communication. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of community health worker services that contribute to achievement of behavioral and clinical outcomes versus the EUC control group is hypothesized. This intervention will be implemented in collaboration with REACH Detroit, an existing partnership between university and community organizations which aims to reduce racial and ethnic disparities by preventing diabetes and its complications. The REACH Detroit and its collaborators have a successful record of community-based participatory intervention research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research aims to demonstrate how a culturally tailored community health worker intervention can be a cost-effective method for assisting Latinos with diabetes to improve their self-management skills and health status. If successful, the methods and results of this research will assist communities and health providers and systems to include community health worker services within their systems of care. Ultimately, we believe such interventions hold one key to eliminating disparities in diabetes care and diabetes complications.       ",Community Health Worker Diabetes RCT for

"Greater Denver Latino Cancer Prevention/Control Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   The Latino Research and Policy Center, under PI Dr. Estevan Flores, at the University of Colorado at Denver, will expand its SPN to 30 Latino community based organizations and create the Colorado Front Range Latino Community Network (CFRLCN) in 10 Colorado counties, representing 80 percent of all Colorado Latinos and 83 percent of all Latino cancer cases.  The Network will be composed of health clinics and agencies serving Latinos including Denver Health Medical Center, the CU Health Sciences' Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, Disease Prevention Division, and La Salud Health Clinics. The CFRLCN builds on previous work on cancer awareness, education and research activities in the Latino population like our SPN's five pilot projects. Future activities include efforts in awareness, prevention and early detection of breast, cervical, prostate, lung (including smoking cessation) and colorectal cancers.  Colorado Cancer Registry data has been used to target specific cancers for intervention in these 10 counties.  Education and prevention activities include Dia de la Mujer Latina, and a colorectal education/prevention outreach program.  The CFRLCN will reduce cancer health disparities in the 10 counties and will embark, in Years 1 and 2, on a community participatory research framework in intervention research to achieve these aims.  This work will lead to development of interventions and pilot proposals and large scale interventions (R01s).  Three plans address separately junior investigator training, health disparities community research, and education and prevention projects.  A separate pilot research proposal by Dr. Tim Byers (PI) will test sustainable navigation and support for the Hispanic cancer survivor.

"Complementary & Alternative Care Behavior in HIV+ Latinos in the US-Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos in the United States (US) - Mexico border region. HIV-positive Latinos in the US face substantial health disparities when compared to non- Latino Whites, including delayed care entry/entering care with advanced HIV disease and they are disproportionately impacted by HIV-stigma and poor patient-provider communication. CAM use (e.g. herbal therapies, alternative healers, and spirituality/religious practices) may be implicated in disparities (e.g. low antiretroviral therapy (ARVs) adherence). Study aims and hypotheses are: Aim 1: To assess CAM-specific health care behavior, including bi-national CAM utilization from allied/alternative health personnel (e.g. pharmacists, non-Western medicine healers) among HIV-positive Latinos residing in Tijuana and San Diego. Hypothesis 1 (H1) Greater use of CAM will be observed among HIV-positive Latinos who report a) crossing the U.S. border more frequently, and b) having migrated to Tijuana or San Diego (e.g. from southern Mexico). Aim 2: To assess use of CAM in the context of HIV treatment utilization and practices, including factors related to delayed entry into HIV care (e.g. HIV stigma); and utilization of and adherence to ARVs among HIV-positive Latinos residing in Tijuana or San Diego. H2.a) Compared to HIV-positive Latinos who report using herbal CAM, those who do not use herbal CAM are more likely to be receiving ARVs and report higher levels of adherence to ARVs; H2.b) Compared to HIV-positive Latinos who do not attend religious services regularly, those who attend religious services regularly are more likely to be receiving ARV; H2.c) Compared to HIV- positive Latinos who report experiencing HIV-related stigma, those who do not report experiencing HIV-related stigma are significantly more likely to be receiving ARV. Aim 3: To determine perceived barriers to communicating use of CAM and ARV adherence to clinicians among HIV-positive Latinos residing in Tijuana or San Diego, including satisfaction with clinician communication, concern about clinician response to reporting CAM use and perception of ARV efficacy; H3) Among CAM users, disclosure of CAM use will be higher among Latino patients who report higher satisfaction with clinician communication than among those who report lower satisfaction. Aim 4: To explore provider and system barriers to culturally-effective communication about CAM and ARV adherence in HIV+ Latinos. In Aims 1-3 we will conduct quantitative, interviewer-administered surveys with 200 HIV+ Latinos (100 from each side of the border). Aim 4 will assess clinician perspectives on CAM through interviews with 20 HIV clinicians on both sides of the border. This study will reduce health disparities in US Latinos by improving culturally-effective clinician communication and will lead to interventions to increase adherence to ARVs and improved health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos on the San Diego/Tijuana border. CAM use among US Latinos living with HIV is associated with delayed utilization of and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapies (ARVs) that may exacerbate health disparities in HIV care access and health outcomes. This study will lead to development of culturally-effective interventions to improve access and adherence to HIV care in Latinos who face health disparities.           Project Narrative The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos on the San Diego/Tijuana border.

"Disseminating Scientific Information on Autism to the Latino Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (15): Translational Science and Specific Challenge Topic 15-NR-101: NIH Partners in Research Program: Pathways for Translational Research. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) represent a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that cause significant impairments in language, learning, thinking and social communication. Findings of racial, cultural, and linguistic (RCL) disparities in access to services for children and adults with disabilities are consistent regardless of the service system being accessed. Specific findings show that children with ASD from culturally and linguistically diverse families have more difficulty accessing services, are diagnosed later than their mainstream counterparts and receive a different mix of services. Studies suggest that these disparities are multi-factorial in nature, but most studies indicate that a ""lack of information"" is reported by consumers from all ethnic groups. This project utilizes theories of health communication and relationship-oriented social marketing strategies to develop and field-test a prototype for distilling scientific articles on ASD into consumer-friendly audience-defined Science Briefs and to effectively disseminate these informational products to Latino families. The central premise of this work is that strong, robust collaborations between academic institutions and community-based networks serving underserved populations are necessary to create a ""bridge"" infrastructure to translate research findings into formats which are easily accessible and meaningful. The goal is to get scientific information that is understandable and useful into the hands of Latino consumers. Building on our current NIH Partners in Research Program, we propose to use Fiesta Educativa as the bridging entity between the research community and Latino families of children with autism in this translational research effort to 1) Develop and field-test a culturally appropriate consumer-accessible product format for scientific journal articles designed for Latino families with children with ASD; 2) Develop and field-test two ""relationship-oriented"" knowledge transfer strategies specific for the Latino community; 3) Describe the nature of the socio-spatial knowledge networks available to the community of Latino families of children with ASD and how these networks may support or impede knowledge transfer; and 4) Evaluate the impact of the project's Knowledge Transfer interventions. This project focuses on translating scientific information on autism spectrum disorders into everyday language so that Latino families can understand and utilize scientific discoveries in their health decision-making process. Our research is done in partnership with Fiesta Educativa, a community-based education, advocacy, and support organizing serving Latino families who have children with disabilities. Together, we will develop and study the most effective strategies to translate scientific information about autism research and bring it into the hands of consumers, Latino families. The long term goal is to develop a model for academic institutions nationwide.              PROJECT NARRATIVE This project focuses on translating scientific information on autism spectrum disorders into everyday language so that Latino families can understand and utilize scientific discoveries in their health decision-making process.

"Defining Latino Intercultural Competence and Its Relationship to Depression    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The application entitled Defining Latino Intercultural Competence and Its Relationship to Depression, proposes to examine Latino intercultural competence, or proficiency of skills that facilitate cultural interactions, and its influence on psychological distress. This innovative construct will advance the research on mental health disparities by examining the underlying processes that link culture and psychopathology. The result will be a comprehensive account of cultural experiences that directly influence psychological functioning. The specific aims of the study are: 1) to refine Latino intercultural competence through the development of a culturally-appropriate measure, and 2) to examine the ability of the constructed Latino intercultural competence scale to predict mental health and depression. To accomplish the first specific aim, three sub-goals are outlined including: a) generation of items and development of the Latino intercultural competence scale; b) examination of reliability and exploration of factor structure; and c) analysis of validity. A methodological tool known as cultural consensus analysis, adapted from the field of medical anthropology, will be used to describe the features of Latino intercultural competence (aim sub-goal 1a). Examining scale reliability and validity will be accomplished via survey procedures to determine internal consistency and checks for content (aim sub-goal 1b-1c). The second specific aim will entail completing paper-and-pencil questionnaires to investigate the impact of Latino intercultural competence on mental health while accounting for orthogonal dimensions and subfactors of acculturation. The current project will add to current conceptualizations of adaptation and determine the skills-based factors that protect Latinos from negative psychological consequences. Such a focus is readily transferable to culturally-effective intervention efforts that ease recovery and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: As mental health problems, particularly depression, are a significant and growing problem in the Latino community, the relevance of this project is evident in its contributions to understanding the underlying aspects of Latino culture that serve to buffer individuals from negative psychological consequences. The information from the study will be used to facilitate more effective ways of dealing with psychological difficulties that take advantage of the resources that are characteristic of the Latino way of life. This will lay the groundwork for creating better management strategies of prevalent health and mental health problems in the Latino.                ",Defining Latino Intercultural Competence and Its Relationship to Depression,7591792,R21MH077735,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Encapsulated ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Language ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Literature ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Persons ', ' Immigrant ', ' Reliance ', ' Paper ', ' Anthropology ', ' tool ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Behavior ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' Buffers ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Prevention ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' psychological distress ', ' Competence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Communities ', ' protective effect ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' depression ', ' ']",NIMH,MARQUETTE UNIVERSITY,R21,2009,161057,0.12865448958259615
"Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dramatic increase in the population of Latinos-the largest minority group in the U.S.-over the last decade and challenges Latinos face in terms of accessing health care in the U.S. make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors and issues that affect Latino health disparities in the U.S. Our long term goal is to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventually elimination of Latino health disparities, especially those in HIV/AIDS and substance abuse. The objectives of the proposed P20 Center of Excellence-NCMHD Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the U.S. -are: (1) Conducting original research exploring the role of behavioral and social factors contributing to or influencing minority health and health disparities; (2) Translating research findings into effective interventions for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (3) Conducting original research exploring the efficacy of a full range of health promotion and information dissemination approaches for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (4) Establishing innovative partnerships between academic institutions and community groups/organizations; and (5) to increase the number of researchers and professionals who are committed to eliminating health disparities, especially those from minority and medically under-served populations. The proposed Center will expand the activities of two R24 Centers of Excellence in Florida International University (FIU), the largest four-year Hispanic Serving Institution in the U.S. It will build on an existing collaboration between FIU and two community-based organizations: SPECTRUM, the oldest and largest non-profit substance abuse treatment agency in South Florida, and Miami Behavioral Health Center, the largest provider of behavioral healthcare services to Latinos in Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: administrative, research, research education/ training, and community engagement/outreach. Its study population will be the Latino population in Miami-Dade County, the only county in the U.S. with an immigrant majority, 97 percent of which are Latinos. The contributions of the Center are significant, since the Center will fill in the need to conduct research that bridges HIV/AIDS and substance use, enhance trust between the researchers and the community, and produce a cadre of scientists conducting research on health disparities-especially those from Latino and other minority and medically under-served populations. Relevance to Public Health: The Center is expected to lead to development and refinement of culturally relevant and evidence-based HIV prevention strategies available to HIV-uninfected/ infected individuals and users of substances among the Latinos, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS and substance abuse epidemics in the U.S.          ",Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States,7650315,P20MD002288,[''],NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,P20,2009,1609055,0.022119022647667984
"Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos have been consistently found to underutilize formal mental health services and are less likely to receive quality care for mental and behavioral disorders compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Efficacious treatments for mental disorders are available, but dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions for Latinos is limited. An annual LBHI Conference for five years is proposed to improve the exchange of scientific findings and enhance collaboration among 1000 attendees annually representing researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, consumers and their families. The conference sessions will provide findings on evidence-based interventions across the life span, and sessions that address the contextual issues (e.g., culturally and linguistically relevant program approaches, community characteristics, system-level barriers and interventions), and process issues (e.g. engagement strategies) that are critical to addressing the disparities in service access and utilization. The Conferences are a collaborative effort between LBHI and national, state, county and community partners to provide a forum for the exchange of information on the distinctive mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, and resilience issues of Latinos. They are also designed to provide a forum for developing strategic partnerships and community participation to support research capacity relevant to Latino mental health. The Conferences support, as attendees, investigators at the pre-doctoral, post-doctoral, and early investigator levels to stimulate their interest in Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the Latino organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. LBHI will convene a national strategic planning process to identify the: 1) information needs of target attendees regarding evidence-based interventions in Latino service settings and 2) effective dissemination and implementation mechanisms to address conference objectives. Barriers to effective dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions into Latino service settings will be addressed by the Conferences through the following objectives. The annual Conference will: (1) result in enhanced capacity of researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, and consumers and their families to collaborate in the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions in service settings for Latinos; (2) increase the capacity to conduct research in Latino mental health service settings through the formation of strategic partnerships, community engagement and the submission of NIH grant applications; and, (3) increase investigator knowledge and interest in addressing Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. The Latino Behavioral Health Institute (LBHI) proposes a series of five annual conferences designed to enhance behavioral health services to the Latino community, the fastest growing, and yet in terms of mental health services, the most underserved population in the United States. The purpose of the annual conferences is to facilitate the exchange of scientific information and clinical experience among the over 1000 attendees including researchers, clinicians, policy makers, consumers and their families. By improving the link between research and clinical practice, the LBHI conferences aim to provide participants with the knowledge and skills to decrease the disparities in mental health service utilization among Latinos and improve the overall health and mental health of the largest minority group in the United States.          ",Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference,7688157,R13MH078724,"['Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Advocate ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Family ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Institutes ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Recovery ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' United States ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' interest ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' County ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Latino ', ' behavioral health ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' clinical practice ', ' ']",NIMH,LATINO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INSTITUTE,R13,2009,24275,0.04588180892476277
"A Partnership Approach to Reducing HIV Disparities Among Latino Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern United States has the fastest growing Latino population in the country and carries a disproportionate HIV/AIDS disease burden. We propose a 5-year study (R24) to fully implement and rigorously evaluate a piloted lay health advisor (LHA) intervention designed to reduce risk of HIV infection among recently arrived, monolingual, less-acculturated Latino men who are settling in the Southeast. The intervention is based on social cognitive theory and the theory of empowerment education and was developed using community-based participatory research (CBPR). This study is a result of a long-term community-university partnership that has used and will continue to use CBPR throughout all phases of the research process.      A total of 20 Latino soccer teams in rural NC will be randomized to an LHA-led HIV prevention intervention or a delayed-intervention comparison group. One man from each of the intervention teams (n=10) will be nominated by his teammates and selected as an LHA in Year 2. The delayed-intervention teams (n=10) will receive the same intervention in Year 3. Quantitative assessment data will be collected from each LHA and 12 of his teammates from each of the 20 teams at: (1) baseline, (2) immediate postintervention, and (3) 12-month follow-up.      Participants in the HIV prevention intervention, relative to their peers in the delayed-intervention comparison group, are anticipated to demonstrate (1) increased self-reported use of condoms during sexual intercourse and (2) increased self-reported utilization of HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD) counseling, testing, and treatment services.      To further evaluate and explore the intervention, qualitative data will be collected using individual in-depth interviews with LHAs and their teammates. We also will evaluate the CBPR process, using direct observation of partnership meetings, in-depth interviews with partners, and partnership document review.      Products from this study will include (1) a Spanish-language intervention that is ready for dissemination and adaptation, culturally relevant and gender-specific, and designed to reduce HIV risk among recently arrived, less-acculturated Latino men; (2) a deeper understanding of HIV risk and intervention among Latino men that will be reported through briefs, newspaper articles, local and national presentations, and manuscripts; and (3) insight into a research partnership process that includes lay community members, Latino soccer leagues and teams, AIDS service organizations, community-based organizations, 3 universities, and a broad spectrum of other partners.          ",A Partnership Approach to Reducing HIV Disparities Among Latino Men,7672297,R24MD002774,"['Evaluation Research ', ' Principal

"PictureRx: An Intervention to Reduce Latino Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major health disparities in chronic disease control and outcomes exist among Latinos, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. If these disparities continue, demographic trends will magnify their adverse health, societal, and economic impact. Chronic disease control often requires successful management of multiple prescription medications, yet many patients struggle to understand medication information, which contributes to poor adherence and outcomes. The situation is particularly challenging for Latino patients, the majority of whom have low health literacy and/or limited English proficiency. Medication instructions that incorporate illustrations and plain language have been proven to enhance medication management, particularly among patients with low health literacy. However, few tools have been developed to generate such instructions in a way that could be delivered to Latino and other underserved populations. PictureRx is an innovative, effective, affordable, evidence-based technology which enables patients, their caregivers, or health professionals to rapidly develop illustrated medication instructions. The PictureRx platform, which is available in English via the internet, is well-suited for adaptation to serve the needs of the Latino community, where it may enhance medication management and reduce health disparities.  The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1) Adapt PictureRx into a Spanish-language, culturally appropriate educational intervention for improving medication management and outcomes among Latinos, and 2) Conduct a small randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the Spanish-language PictureRx, compared to traditional prescription instructions, on Latinos' knowledge of their medication regimens.  The project team consists of experienced software engineers and academic physicians with expertise in business development and clinical research among underserved populations. For Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and interviews with Latino patients, their caregivers, and health care professionals, as well as leading national experts who have agreed to serve as key informants. We will use this information in an iterative fashion to adapt PictureRx for the Latino community. For Aim 2, we will enroll 200 patients in a randomized study at the Cayce Clinic, a safety net clinic which primarily serves Latino patients. Patients in the intervention group will receive PictureRx illustrated schedules of their daily medication regimen, while those in the control group will receive usual care. The study will evaluate the effect of PictureRx on Latino patients' understanding of their medication regimen (primary outcome), as well as their self-reported adherence (secondary outcome).  Through a process of development and evaluation which engages the Latino community, our goal is to complete a culturally-appropriate and effective adaptation of PictureRx for Latinos. This will set the stage for subsequent efforts to disseminate PictureRx as an appropriate technology to reduce health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine and this SBIR announcement have called for innovative approaches to reduce health disparities.

"Implementing the Health for All Model with Latino Community of Kansas City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to longstanding health disparities in multiple minority populations, there is a deep need for innovative strategies and models that change community conditions and promote health equity. The aim of this proposal is to implement the culturally and contextually-adapted Health for All model, a promising pilot-tested intervention to change community conditions to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes risk factors in the Latino community in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas. Using community-based participatory research methods, the project will assure that community members are equal and essential partners in developing, implementing and evaluating interventions focused on reducing health disparities. This project builds on the long-term relationship between the KU Work Group for Community Health and Development, at the University of Kansas, and the Kansas City - Chronic Disease Coalition. The community intervention will be comprised of several key components and elements, including: the creation of a clear vision and mission, logic model, and action plan adapted for the local Latino community; the assurance of intensive supports for the plan's implementation; the hiring of community mobilizers; documentation and review of activities for feedback and improvement; and shared responsibility among scientific and community partners for the project's development, implementation, and evaluation. Community-determined long-term objectives focus on related risk behaviors (e.g., increasing daily fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity levels, cholesterol screen levels, and decreasing obesity). This will be achieved through the implementation of an action plan that puts in place new programs, policies and practices at the community and system levels that affect risk for CVD and diabetes in the Latino community and among organizations that serve Latinos.

"Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will test the causal effects of social capital on levels and inequalities of children's social and cognitive development during the early elementary years. Social capital here refers to trust and shared expectations embedded in social networks of parents, teachers, and children. For young children, social capital operates primarily through their relationships with their parents, enhancing development through mechanisms of social support and social control. Children from low-income Latino families are a special focus of the study. The research design is experimental: social capital will be manipulated through a well-tested intervention Families and Schools Together (FAST) that will enhance the social capital among parents, teachers, and children through an intensive after-school program and a 2-year follow-up program. The study will include 52 schools in Milwaukee and San Antonio (about 208 teachers and 3,120 first graders and their families), with half the schools randomly selected for the intervention and half serving as controls. The experimental design will permit a strong test of the causal role of social capital. The project will also involve an implementation study intended to illuminate the processes by which social capital is generated and affects child development. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, drawing on sociology, psychology, and economics,and it reflects an ecological perspective that crosses boundaries between families and schools. The study thus responds to the call for research on the Science and Ecology of Early Development. Key aspects of child development will be assessed, including (a) social skills and problem behavior from standardized behavioral ratings by parents; (b) the latter plus academic competence as rated by teachers; and (c) grade retention, attendance rates, and third-grade reading and mathematics scores from school records. Social capital will be measured with repeated surveys of teachers and parents that address the extent of social networks, parent involvement, trust, and shared expectations among parents, between parents and schools, and between parents and children. Data will be analyzed with multilevel statistical models that take account of variation at the individual and school levels of analysis.RELEVANCE. Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, and among the most disadvantaged. Latino families often perceive a sense of distance from the school system, which can create barriers to their children's academic and social development, important dimensions of public health. This study will yield practical as well as scientific insights into the value of increased social capital for development of children among a variety of demographic groups, and particularly those from low-income Latino families.          ",Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study,7653770,R01HD051762,"['Disadvantaged ', ' Low income ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Social Network ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials ', ' Interview ', ' teacher ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Inequality ', ' Mathematics ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Parents ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Development ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Sociology ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' first grade ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' intervention program ', ' expectation ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' third grade ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' after-school program ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Absenteeism ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2009,838239,0.06808873208394509
"A Cultural Approach to the Study of Latino Parenting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Latino children and adolescents have higher rates of behavior problems and academic failure compared with chilldren and adolescents from other ethnic groups. The developmental outcomes of Latino youth appear to be related to family functioning variables and to parenting practices in particular. Yet, there is limited understanding of Latino parenting and of the relation between Latino parenting and child outcomes. The purpose of this application is to study Latino parenting of preschool-aged children using a culturally informed framework of parenting that focuses on cultural childrearing values and Latina mothers' value-driven behavior in different cultural contexts, as well as a traditional framework of parenting, to predict child behavior and pre-academic functioning. An understanding of parenting practices that are predictive of child behavioral and pre-academic functioning in Latino preschoolers is critical in the design of preventive interventions that enhance functioning among Latino preschoolers by promoting specific parenting practices.  Such services are key in addressing mental health disparities seen between Latino and non-Latino youth. To accomplish these goals, a career development plan will focus on training for the Candidate in: 1) culturally informed research, 2) ethnographic methodology, 3) behavioral observation and coding of parentchild interactions, and 4) statistical methods and analyses related to measure development, qualitative studies, model testing, and prevention trials. Training will be accomplished through formal coursework, individual tutorials with mentors and consultants, and participation in conferences on relevant topjcs.  Moreover, this training plan will be supplemented by a research plan that includes a qualitative study of cultural childrearing values that will be used for measurement development and a quantitative study of Latino parenting, assessed from both cultural and traditional perspectives, and its relation to child behavior and pre-academic functioning.

"Promoting physical activity among Latino youth: A community-based approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The applicant's long-term career goal is to conduct a program of clinical community-based participatory research aimed at prevention of chronic disease through the promotion of physical activity with underserved and disenfranchised populations. Historically, these populations have been omitted from clinical research and are at high risk for chronic illness. Immediate goals are to expand current research skills, incorporate a community-based participatory research approach, and work with a Latino community. To achieve these goals, a focused career development plan is proposed to1) acquire advanced theoretical knowledge and practical experience with conducting community-based participatory research aimed at physical activity promotion in Latino youth, 2) gain literacy in Latino culture, Spanish language, and knowledge of Latino health issues, and 3) gain advanced skills and mentored experience in designing and implementing interventions aimed at physical activity promotion. Research to be conducted will use a community-based participatory approach to address the lack of physical activity in Latino adolescents, which is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHO), the leading cause of death in the US. Latinos comprise 13% of the population of the US and are the fastest growing minority group. Latino youth bear a greater burden of CHD risk factors, compared with white non-Hispanic youth. In order to improve long-term cardiovascular outcomes for Latino youth, we must address risk factors early in adolescence. Increasing physical activity is one way to reduce CHD risk in Latino youth. There is a paucity of research directed toward promoting physical activity among Latino youth and this study addresses this critical gap. Thus, the specific aims of the proposed study are to 1) assess and evaluate community resources for physical activity, and 2) develop and assess the feasibility of a culturally appropriate physical activity intervention for middle school Latino adolescents. Qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for the community assessment. Based on the analysis of the community assessment data, the physical activity intervention will be finalized in partnership with the community. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected for the feasibility assessment. The feasibility assessment will include a process evaluation, identification of barriers to participation by the adolescents in the intervention, and an outcomes evaluation.          ",Promoting physical activity among Latino youth: A community-based approach,7640769,K23NR010557,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Clinical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Language ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' literacy ', ' School-Age Population ', ' school age ', ' Development Plans ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' United States ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Belief ', ' middle school ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' career development ', ' girls ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,K23,2009,127278,0.10910782961775123
"Latin American Cancer Research Coalition    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   There are approximately 36 million Latinos known to be living in the US and by the year 2050, this group will constitute 25 percent of the US population.  Cancer is the second leading cause of death among this rapidly growing minority group.  Latinos have higher rates of cancers with infectious etiologies.  For other sites, despite lower incidence, Latinos have more late stage, higher mortality-to-incidence ratios, and inferior survival compared to Caucasians.  Lifestyle changes associated with acculturation may also increase future cancer risks.  The greater Washington-Baltimore tri-state region (DC, Maryland, Virginia) has one of the largest urban concentrations of Latinos in the US. Latinos in this region are predominately of Central and South American ancestry, recently immigrated, un-insured, and largely monolingual.  We developed the Latin American Cancer Research Coalition (LACRC) as a local network in DC to address the unique needs of this Latino subgroup.  In our first 4 years, the LACRC trained community coordinators, students, and faculty, submitted an R25T post-doctoral grant, obtained pilot and career development funding, published manuscripts, and disseminated results with the community.  We propose to expand the LACRC as a regional network.  The overarching goal of this regional network is to document, understand, and reduce cancer disparities in Latinos.  LACRC partners include multidisciplinary, multicultural, and bilingual researchers and staff from the Washington Hospital Center/Cancer Institute, Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center, Georgetown university, 19 community safety net clinics across our region, the Inova-Fairfax community hospital, and consultants and advisors from the regional Departments of Health and Tumor Registries, the Council of Latino Agencies, the National Council of La Raza, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the regional NCI Cancer Information Service and Spanish-language support line, the ACS, and others.  LACRC aims are to:  1) enhance capacity, especially for data collection on Latinos; 2) use the PRECEDE-PROCEED model to guide participatory research and use results to inform education, training, and planning; and 3) obtain funding, influence policy, and evaluate progress.  The structure of the LACRC is ideally suited as a platform for bridging the gaps between research discovery and delivery, and developing, evaluating, and disseminating culturally competent interventions across the spectrum of cancer control.  Our approach should be broadly portable to reducing disparities in other US urban Latino communities         ",Latin American Cancer Research Coalition,7657362,U01CA114593,"['Costs and Benefits ', '

"Improving Latino Health Literacy: An Intergenerational Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this FAST TRACK SBIR is to develop and evaluate a culturally relevant health literacy- training program for Latinos to improve the knowledge and skills to protect health and prevent disease. This program is tentatively entitled Entre Nuestra Familias/Among Our Latino Families (ENF). Drawing from traditional Hispanic values, the ENF Program provides an intergenerational approach to health education, offering multiple members of the family simultaneous training in key health literacy skills and information on cross-cutting health topics to reinforce healthy behaviors within families and communities. This training program will be offered through community-based organizations to reduce institutional barriers to care that are often experienced by Latinos.  The U.S. Census reported in 2007 that there are45.5 million Hispanics living in the U.S. Not only do Latinos constitute the fastest growing minority group in the country, but they also face significant health challenges. Indeed, Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and there is evidence that the health disparities experienced by Latinos may be linked to significant barriers to health care, including low rates of health insurance, low English proficiency, lack of accurate and culturally relevant health information, a dearth of culturally competent health facilities and information, fear and mistrust of the U.S. Medical system. Because of these disparities and their resulting impact on health, there have been strong calls to develop culturally appropriate public health initiatives to improve the health of Latinos in the U.S. To that end, KDH Research & Communication will develop the ENF Program.  In Phase I, KDHRC will develop the print portions of the training program, and conduct a pilot evaluation of the product's effectiveness, in collaboration with Dia de la Mujer Latino, a health advocacy group that serves Latinos. In Phase II, we will expand the training program to include video elements for the participants and multimedia aspects for the facilitator. Then, we will implement and evaluate the training program at multiple sites to examine the program's effectiveness and the extent to which different social factors (poverty, education, country of origin, geographic location) best predict efficacy of the program, using a quasi- experimental pre-test, post-test evaluation design.  Following product completion and evaluation, the ENF program will be disseminated to community-based organizations nationwide. The results of the evaluation will be disseminated through the academic literature and practice and policy briefs to add to scientific knowledge about best practices for reducing health disparities in Latino communities. Further, we will conduct town hall meetings in our target communities to disseminate results of the evaluation to those most affected by the research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and as a result, there have been strong calls for the public health community to develop culturally appropriate interventions to reduce health disparities. This proposal is to develop an intergenerational health literacy training program that incorporates key aspects of Latino culture to engage and retain participants. The program will be delivered through community based nonprofit and faith-based organizations to reduce barriers to care. After the development and evaluation of this product, the training program will be disseminated nationwide to provide the public health field with an effective and innovative tool to reduce health disparities among Latinos.                Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and as a  result, there have been strong calls for the public health community to develop culturally appropriate  interventions to reduce health disparities.

"Nuestro Futoro Saludable: The JP Partnership for Healthy Caribbean Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Through a community-based participatory research partnership, we will plan for, develop, implement, evaluate and disseminate an intervention to address health disparities in the Caribbean Latino population in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To establish a community advisory board to guide the development, implementation and dissemination of an intervention that is culturally appropriate and community specific. (2) Assure that community needs, advisory board recommendations, and steering committee decisions and actions are aligned. (3) We will a) determine the specific disease/chronic condition to serve as the basis for intervention and b) identify appropriate aspects of the built environment to be targeted by the intervention; and (4) We will a) design and pilot test a community-level disease-specific intervention to address deficiencies and maximize any existing advantages in the built environment, and/or to mitigate the direct and/or indirect effects of the built environment on health, b) conduct both a process and outcome evaluation of the intervention, and c) disseminate findings and develop a full intervention trial. Latinos are and will remain the country's largest minority group well into the future. In the northeast Caribbean Latinos (Puerto Ricans and Dominicans) represent the largest segment of the Latino population. Because of the youthfulness of the demographic, Latino children/youth are a priority age group. By addressing the causes of health disparities among Latino children and youth early and life, it is possible to provide children with living environments and social conditions conducive to good health, which can create pathways to health as opposed to disparities. This project is significant because, (1) it is a within-group intervention research project targeting a not well-understood sub-population of the Latino demographic; (2) the project is unique because it brings together a diverse group of community stakeholders; (3) key personnel are primarily people of color, with a majority of bilingual Latina women of varying backgrounds; and (4) the project introduces two new investigators of color.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): Characteristics of the built environment can create/sustain health disparities, hence tackling them requires interventions to address macro-level factors that influence health.

"Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Studies in the U.S. and elsewhere have generally shown that higher social position is strongly associated with lower mortality risks and better health at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder. However, the situation for the Latino population is more complex. Despite the poorer socioeconomic status of Latinos, their infant and adult mortality rates are generally the same as or lower than those for whites, a pattern often referred to as the ""Hispanic Paradox."" A second puzzle pertains to findings in the literature that, despite this mortality advantage, Latino survey respondents are more likely than those in other ethnic groups to rate their overall health as fair or poor. Our preliminary research based on three data sets reveals yet another paradox: for a broad range of health-related behaviors and health outcomes, the social gradients in health for Latino youth and adults are weak or virtually non-existent in contrast to the generally strong gradients for whites. In the proposed project, we will systematically investigate the relationships between socioeconomic status, immigrant status, health behavior, and health outcomes for Latinos in the United States. Although our principal focus will be the Latino population, we will also examine these relationships for other ethnic groups. In addition, we will investigate associations between socioeconomic status and health outcomes in Mexico, which is the largest sending country for Latino immigrants in the U.S. Data for the analysis will come from waves 1 and 2 of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, from the National Health Interview Survey, and from the Mexican Encuesta Nacional de Salud. Our overall goal is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Latino health.              ",Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos,7615694,R01HD051764,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' residence ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' Central American ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mexican ', ' Legal Status ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marmota ', ' Marmots ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mexico ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Native Americans ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Birth Weight ', ' age group ', ' ethnic difference ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' National origin ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2009,412130,0.211954763785763
"Redes En Accion: National Latino Cancer Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Action is urgently needed to address persistent disparities in cancer control and prevention that harm the health of Latino populations.  To meet this need, we propose a comprehensive set of research, education, and training activities to be carried out at the national level and in regional centers in California, Florida, New York, and Texas by an established network of investigators uniquely qualified to understand issues from the perspectives of their diverse populations and to serve as leaders and role models for influencing change and fostering a new generation of Latino scientists and policy advocates.  Research activities will include: 1) development of disparity-related pilot projects for proposals to obtain independent NCI funding for Latino scientists; 2) national, regional, and local policy studies analyzing factors influencing disparities in access to cancer control and prevention, and the capacities of advocates concerned with this issue; and 3) multi-site evaluation of an experimental intervention designed to improve women's capacities for navigating health care systems that provide cancer screening and care.  Education activities at the national and regional levels will include:  1) multi-modal public education and outreach and 2) professional education and outreach for clinical providers and for organizations concerned with policies that influence access to cancer screening and care.  Training activities will consist of mentoring and pilot research support for students and junior scientists developing careers in research aimed at understanding and reducing disparities that affect the cancer health of Latinos.

"Salud y el Exito: Addressing Proven Factors in HIV Prevention for Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Padres Unidos por la Salud y el ¿xito de Nuestros Hijos aims to support Latino parents and schools in their efforts to promote the healthy choices of children, with the goal of reducing behaviors that lead to elevated levels of HIV/AIDS in urban Latino communities. The study is designed to advance efforts to begin HIV prevention early, during the preteen and young adolescent years, before youth establish patterns of behavior that jeopardize their health and success, or ""Salud y ¿xito."" Salud y ¿xito draws on a solid foundation of theoretical and empirical research that underscores the importance of supporting the primary role that parents play in healthy youth development. The study will test a bilingual version of a multi-year parent-mediated intervention, Salud y ¿xito, with primary Spanish- as well as English-speaking Latino parents and youth. This intervention consists of parent education delivered through sets of audio-CDs to promote positive parenting practices, including monitoring, rule setting, communication, and support. In addition, Salud y ¿xito M s, an enhanced version of this parent-mediated approach, will be tested. This enhanced intervention integrates audio-CD parent education with a school-based parent involvement program, PALMS Tools for Latino Family Outreach. These tools facilitate the creation of welcoming environments that encourage parental involvement in their preteens' and young adolescents' academic success and future education planning. This is critical because Latinos experience the highest levels of school dropout and school failure, which are both consequences and risk factors for risky behaviors related to HIV/AIDS. Both intervention components have a common purpose: Promoting positive parenting practices known to foster resiliency and protect youth from risk. The specific aims are to: (1) Enroll and randomly assign 60 urban schools serving high proportions of Latino families to one of three conditions: (a) Salud y ¿xito multi-year parent education; (b) Salud y ¿xito M s parent education supplemented with PALMS; or a (c) comparison condition (health education print materials); (2) Enroll 1600 Latino families with youth from 6th grade classes in the study and conduct telephone parent surveys and youth classroom surveys at baseline; (3)Implement Salud y ¿xito intervention components at schools assigned to the intervention conditions; (4) Conduct youth surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions are effective in reducing risk behaviors and intentions and promoting school attachment and pro-social activities; (5) Conduct parent surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions promote and sustain positive parenting practices; (6) Examine how parenting practices and youth outcomes vary by individual and family characteristics, including gender as well as acculturation; and (7) Examine whether youth outcomes are explained by parenting practices and identify which parenting practices mediate the relationship between experimental condition and youth outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Salud y el ¿xito aims to support Latino parents and schools in their efforts to promote the academic success and healthy choices of children, with the goal of reducing behaviors that lead to elevated levels of HIV/AIDS in urban Latino communities.

"Barriers to Care & Treatment Practices in HIV+ Latinos in US-Mexico Border Region    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify barriers to HIV care among HIV- positive Latinos in the U.S.-Mexico border region. California ranks among the top five states with highest numbers of Latino AIDS cases and Latinos comprise 66% of reported HIV cases in San Diego County's southern region. Latinos face substantial barriers to HIV care and enter care at advanced stages of HIV disease, but reasons for this are poorly understood, and could involve issues related to stigma, HIV treatment optimism and use of traditional, complementary and/or alternative medicines (CAM). We will assess barriers to HIV care and care practices among Latinos in the U.S.-Mexico border region applying Andersen & Aday's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use as our conceptual framework to study environmental, structural, behavioral and societal factors. We propose a community-based binational collaborative study that builds on existing academic-community partnerships and employs quantitative and qualitative methods to address aims. Aim 1: To assess binational health care seeking behavior and HIV treatment utilization, including access to ARVs and use of CAM (e.g. folk medicine, herbal medicine) among HIV-positive Latinos who currently reside in Tijuana, Baja California, Mexico or San Diego, CA. Aim 2: To determine specific barriers to HIV care, including manifestations of HIV-related stigma, mobility and spirituality/religiosity among HIV-positive Latinos who reside in Tijuana and San Diego. Aim 3: To explore provider and system-level barriers to continuity of HIV care and receipt of ARVs in HIV-positive Latinos within the health care delivery context of both sides of the US- Mexico border. To address Aims 1 and 2 we will conduct a quantitative study, based on interviewer- administered surveys with 200 HIV-positive persons (100 participants recruited from both sides of border). We will use descriptive and multivariate logistic regression statistical analyses to test specific hypotheses. To meet Aim 3, we will purposively sample 20 providers/administrators, conducting in-depth interviews on experiences with patient barriers to HIV care. Following Grounded Theory methods, data collection and analysis will include development and revision of interview guides using constant comparison method. The investigator team will independently code and reach consensus on interview coding to reflect themes/issues, accounts of behaviors, and opinions on organizational/system characteristics that influence health services. This study will decrease health disparities in HIV-positive Latinos through improved understanding of HIV care-seeking behavior; HIV care practices}including CAM use; development of community-based and culturally-relevant research methods and measures; and advancing efforts to positively impact care delivery in Latinos living in the US- Mexico border region and in other US Latino populations living with HIV/AIDS. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify barriers to HIV care among HIV- positive Latinos in the U.S.-Mexico border region. Latinos face substantial barriers to HIV care and enter care at advanced stages of HIV disease, but reasons for this are poorly understood, and could involve issues related to stigma, HIV treatment optimism and use of traditional, complementary and/or alternative medicines (CAM). The proposed study will assess barriers to HIV care and care practices among HIV-positive Latinos in the U.S.-Mexico border region applying Andersen & Aday's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use as our conceptual framework to study environmental, structural, behavioral and societal factors.          ",Barriers to Care & Treatment Practices in HIV+ Latinos in US-Mexico Border Region,7645604,R21MH084266,"['Community Developments ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' Data Collection ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Geographic state ', ' US State ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Behavioral ', ' Folk Medicine ', ' traditional medicine (folk) ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Herb ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Interviewer ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Alternative Medicine ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' optimism ', ' postiive attitude ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Herbal Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Staging ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Stigmata ', ' Consensus ', ' Solutions ', ' Life ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vitamins ', ' Side ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' care seeking ', ' Budgets ', ' California ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Administrator ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",R21,2009,153089,0.0010460392288906474
"Behavior & Clinical Trials Participation in HIV+ Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Through this research career development award, I will complete the initial steps to establish myself as an independent researcher in HIV/AIDS behavioral research to reduce health disparities in Latino communities infected with HIV. Using didactic and mentored learning, I will improve upon my existing behavioral, qualitative, and quantitative research skills to address the issue of low participation in HIV/AIDS clinical trials in Latino communities. Proportionate representation of minority populations in research trials is necessary to improve research capacity to generalize results to diverse populations infected with HIV. My specific research aims are to: 1) Describe and understand the attitudes, beliefs, cultural and social norms, provider and system influences relating to entry into clinical trials in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and 2) Develop and pilot test an intervention for improving understanding and acceptance of HIV clinical trials participation by HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos and their communities. The theoretical framework of the research plan is the Behavioral Model of Health Services Use (Andersen, Aday, et al.). The research plan will be carried out in three phases, each phase linked to a career development objective and activity. In Phase 1 I will conduct formative research using qualitative methods with HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, including design and implementation of an in-depth interview protocol and focus group questions to explore factors to consider in attempting to improve clinical trials participation in Latino populations. In Phase 2 I will carry out qualitative analysis, develop a social cognitive model of participation in research, develop research hypotheses, and develop and pilot test a survey to test the social cognitive model in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos. In Phase 3 I will validate the survey, analyze and report outcomes, design and pilot-test a behavioral intervention to increase clinical trials participation in HIV+ Mexican-origin Latinos, and finally, use intervention pilot data to prepare an R01 proposal to the NIH to promote participation of HIV+ Latinos in clinical trials.

"UPR-CHA Research Center of Excellence: Making a Difference for Latino Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Health and health service disparities are pervasive in asthma and mental disorders in both Puerto Rico and the United States among Latinos. The causes for these disparities are poorly understood and effective interventions to eliminate these disparities are needed. The mission of the proposed University of Puerto Rico-Cambridge Health Alliance Research Center of Excellence (UPR-CHA RCE) is to conduct research on Latino health and health care disparities, specifically mental disorders, substance abuse and asthma, and to generate and test models of improved service delivery to eliminate these disparities. The UPR-CHA RCE will build on the strengths and experiences of the UPR-CHA EXPORT Center. The UPR-CHA RCE is led by an experienced and diverse research team with a long history of collaboration and commitment to the study of service disparities among minority populations. The Center is structured around a Research, Administrative and Training Core. Based on a conceptual model developed by the group, three research projects will test multi-level interventions at the provider, individual/family and policy level to reduce health services disparities in mental disorders and pediatric asthma (Projects 1 and 2) and provide data to understand the magnitude of substance abuse treatment disparities and the social and economic burden of these disparities (Project 3). Two pilot projects open up new areas of research on disparities, one focusing on a low-cost prevention intervention for mothers of asthmatic children at risk for depression (Pilot 1) and another on documenting disparities in the treatment of mentally ill nursing home residents (Pilot 2). The five aims of the proposed UPR-CHA-RCE are to: 1) Establish an administrative structure that integrates and centralizes a synergistic core of researchers into a single interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary enterprise by pulling together resources, leadership, and expertise from the mainland US and Puerto Rico. 2) Continue to establish, strengthen and maintain partnerships with organizations and communities for conducting original and relevant research leading to improvement in Latino health and in eliminating service disparities. 3) Enhance research and training activities of the ongoing UPR-CHA EXPORT Center to mentor and develop Latino investigators and to increase the number of minority researchers who conduct health disparities research. 4) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary asthma and mental health services and intervention research program to increase our understanding of and eliminate and/or reduce service disparities of Latinos in all stages of their life cycle. 5) Disseminate and integrate the product of these efforts to inform policy decisions, clinical practice and community partners, and orient health service systems to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services.          ",UPR-CHA Research Center of Excellence: Making a Difference for Latino Health,7630502,P60MD002261,[''],NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,P60,2009,2305729,-0.04248120976134596
"Advanced Center for Latino and MH Systems Research    DESCRIPTIONS (provided by applicant):       Center Core. There are pervasive ethnic and racial disparities in mental health service utilization and in mental health status yet the underlying causes of these disparities are poorly understood. This application seeks to establish an Advanced Center for Latino and Mental Health Systems Research (Advanced Latino Disparities Center) that focuses on understanding the factors affecting mental health service disparities in Latinos and generating research and knowledge to eliminate them. This Center will be part of the Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research (CMMHR) and is built on the strengths and learning experiences of our ongoing NIMH-funded Latino Research Program Project (LRPP). The proposed Center is a five-year project, structured around two large (R01) and two smaller (pilot) projects. We support the research with an Administrative and Methods Core led by experienced, multidisciplinary investigators, build on the collaborative partnerships that characterize our past work, and mentor and develop junior investigators to become new experts in health disparities research. The overall aims of the Advanced Latino Disparities Center are to: (1) Establish an administrative structure that supports a synergistic core of researchers to conduct mental health service disparities research; (2) Institute a methodological and statistical component as an integral part of the proposed program; (3) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary mental health services disparity research program with a focus on four program areas: (a) Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos; (b) Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos; (c) Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care; and (d) Dialog with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements; (4) Continue developing a cadre of young investigators committed to mental health service disparities research with Latino populations; and (5) Disseminate the research findings to inform policy decisions and practice, contribute to stakeholders' knowledge, and encourage future disparities research in Latino communities.      Project 1: Improving Clinical Assessment of Diagnosis for Latinos. The goal of this project is to develop and test a mixed methods approach to helping clinicians in public health psychiatric settings decrease clinical uncertainty by more accurately diagnosing patients with diverse cultural backgrounds and improving the matching of clinical services to the needs of Latinos. Our approach combines methods from cultural anthropology with statistical methods and psychiatric epidemiology. The specific aims of this study focus on generating improved cultural formulations and diagnostic accuracy using information from qualitative and quantitative perspectives, iterating between the methods in a complementary fashion. The specific aims are to: Aim 1: Identify the information about symptoms and cultural and social context gathered in the initial diagnostic interview, that clinicians use to make determinations about three disorders: major depression, drug abuse and alcohol abuse; Aim 2: Use data from an epidemiological survey to assess the potential sensitivity and specificity of the clinical determinations identified in Aim1 in detecting the underlying diagnosis. We will test the hypothesis that clinical diagnosis is less accurate for Latino than non-Latino white patients; Aim 3: Assess clinician and patient reactions to the recommended improvements to diagnostic assessments developed in Aim 2. Using focus groups and consensus panels, prioritize the kinds of information to be collected to improve diagnostic determinations in safety net settings. Aim 4: Apply the findings of Aim 3 to make concrete recommendations to improve the efficiency and fairness of diagnostic decisions for Latino and non-Latino white population groups.      Project 2: Identifying Sources Linked to Differential Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) Outcomes for Latinos. In this research we propose to conduct statistical analyses of data from a large quasi-experimental project (ACCESS) and a 2-stage modified Delphi technique to generate recommendations for the modification of assertive community treatment (ACT) when applied to Latino and other severely mentally ill homeless (SMIH) minority populations. The ACCESS study compared the outcome effects of ""augmented"" ACT (i.e., ACT + quality improvement intervention) and standard ACT, and found no evidence of differences. Utilizing a disparities framework, advanced statistical methods, and a 2-stage Delphi method, we propose to conduct service and outcomes disparities research aimed at generating information with clinical or programmatic utility for Latinos. The proposed analyses will generate new evidence on service use and outcomes for Latino SMIH persons treated with ACT, and will broaden our understanding of the effects of quality improvement interventions for   Latinos. Findings will be integrated with expert opinion to generate recommendations regarding ACT for Latino SMIH persons.   The study has four aims:   1. To test for disparities in service use for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   2. To test for outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons served by standard and augmented ACT   3. To estimate the impact of observed service disparities on observed outcome disparities for Latino and African American as compared to white SMIH persons   4. To integrate results from analyses of service and outcome disparities for Latinos, a literature review, and expert opinion, and generate recommendations to improve ACT for Latino SMIH persons.      Pilot 1: Ethnic Differences in Perceived Impairment and Need for Care. Parental belief that the child needs mental health care has been found to be the most significant factor associated with service use in non-minority populations. The results of several studies suggest that Latino parents are less likely than European Americans to recognize and/or label their children's behavior as a mental health problem requiring intervention. It is not clear which factors explain this lower recognition of mental health problems by Latino parents, and consequently the lower utilization of mental health services by this group. Differences between providers and parents in their views of children's impairments and/or the kind of problems that require treatment may also explain some of the lower utilization of mental health services among Latino children. There is some evidence that providers from different cultures differ in their impairment ratings of children. However, there is no research that examines whether non-Latino white providers as compared to Latino providers are more likely to rate the same children as impaired, nor is there any research that assesses the extent to which parents and providers from different cultures differ in their ratings of children's impairment. This pilot aims to investigate parental and provider beliefs about what is impaired behavior, the severity of the behavior, and the need for treatment in a sample of Mexican Americans, island Puerto Rican and non-Latino providers and parents. We will examine the ratings of providers and parents from the three ethnic groups using case vignettes of children with different levels of impairment and internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Vignettes will be developed utilizing information obtained through secondary analyses of two clinical data sets. We will test the hypothesis that Puerto Rican and Mexican American parents and providers rate the children described in the vignettes as less impaired as compared to non-Latino white parents and providers. We further hypothesize that greater acculturation in Mexican American parents will be associated with less variation between Mexican American and non- Latino white parents in their impairment ratings of the vignettes. We also expect greater congruence in the impairment ratings and perceptions of need for services among parents and providers within the same ethnic group.      Pilot 2: Dialogue with the Latino Community and Healthcare System Stakeholders for Identifying Quality Improvements. A disproportionate number of Latinos rely on free or reduced price care making them more vulnerable to the impact of shrinking resources on the quality of care at safety net healthcare systems. The main goal of this pilot is to identify quality improvements by increasing the Latino community voice in a safety net mental healthcare system. We will explore system concerns (disproportionate impact of economic constraints on quality of care and low levels of participation in mental health services among Latinos) by including members of the Latino community in a participatory research process together with representatives of a healthcare system (i.e., psychiatrists, nurses, social workers, senior hospital administrators, clinic coordinators). In addition, this resulting collaborative stakeholder group will jointly identify leverage points in the community and health care system to launch quality improvements.    The aims of the pilot are to:   1. Consult multiple stakeholders to identify community, client, administrative, provider and mental health care system barriers to access and quality mental health services for Latino patients.   2. Selecting barriers identified from Aim 1, conduct policy implementation analyses that ground the participatory process in a clear, shared understanding of the legal, administrative and fiscal constraints on efforts aimed at quality improvements.   3. Use the information generated in Aims 1 and 2 to launch a participatory process with multiple stakeholders to identify leverage points for mental health care system change. As part of this research, we will generate hypotheses to be tested in the context of community and/or systems interventions and their prospective evaluation in R01 applications.   We intend to use qualitative methods and policy implementation analysis to address these aims. We will build a collaborative, multidisciplinary community and mental health systems advisory group to assist in the identification and design of these quality improvements. By the end of this pilot, we will have a sustainable group of advisors who will work together in the future implementation of the quality improvements identified through this pilot work.      Center Core:         ",Advanced Center for Latino and MH Systems Research,7686294,P50MH073469,[''],NIMH,CAMBRIDGE HEALTH ALLIANCE,P50,2009,870470,0.11234412173972488
"End-of-life treatment preferences of Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End of Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Principal Investigator: Isabel Torres, Dr.P.H. The overall goal of the NCI K01 career development plan is to provide the candidate with a program of mentored research activity and study in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and outcomes research to launch an independent research career with specialization in the integration of these research areas. The five-year plan is carefully designed to 1) obtain further research experience in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and health services research; 2) advance skills related to the design and analyses of prospective palliative care studies through training in advanced statistical methods; 3) improve skills needed to develop and test new instruments and performance measures to improve the accuracy of assessing quality outcomes for both English and Spanish speaking Latinos with cancer; 4) acquire further grant writing skills and experiences, resulting in the submission of an R01 grant before the end of the support period. Properly identifying the end-of-life preferences of cancer patients is a national healthcare priority and understanding the clinical, cultural, psychosocial and system-level factors that influence these decisions is paramount for clinicians and policymakers trying to respect patient preferences and improve their quality of care. The aim of the study is to determine if declining health status influences the end-of-life treatment preferences in Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and how these preferences are modified by factors such as acculturation, health literacy, medical mistrust, provider ethnicity or the use of interpreters, or patient navigators. Participants will be 100 older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, stage III or greater, and 100 contemporaries without cancer. Persons without cancer will be surveyed only once cross-sectionally and those with cancer will be interviewed at baseline and then monthly until twelve months or death to capture the preferences of both those who are undergoing rapid decline and those who are stable. Understanding the relationship between declining functional status and the treatment preferences of older Latinos with cancer has important clinical and policy implications, as findings could influence the use of written documents for advance care planning and inform the content and frequency of discussions that may be needed to capture changes in preferences triggered by changes in health status. We expect the proposed area of study and research that integrates palliative cancer care and health disparities research and applies prospective analytic methods to investigate a critical and understudied area to make a significant contribution to cancer care research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: End-of-Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the older population and new Latino cancer cases are predicted to double within the next twenty years. A person with cancer's choices to forgo life-extending treatment may change over time and as their health declines, yet identifying their choices related to one of life's most difficult periods is not always easy. This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients, influence their end-of-life treatment choices.           End-of-Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the older population and new Latino cancer cases are predicted to double within the next twenty years.

"Johns Hopkins Healthy Eyes Translational Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this cooperative agreement is to assess and evaluate system level and individual level factors that impact access to eye care; and to identify barriers and enablers to the delivery of eye care conforming to best practices that prevent vision loss and promote eye health. The Johns Hopkins Translational Research Center (TRC) will analyze multiple existing databases to develop a knowledge base for a public health interventions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities and improving the eye health of underserved populations in the United States. Specifically, we will focus on focus on cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Finally, we propose a collaborative study that uses this knowledge for implementation at the city level. The first set of analyses will focus on personal and perceived system barriers associated with the uptake of eyecare services in three previously studied populations: African Americans and Caucasians from the Salisbury Eye Evaluation (SEE) study and Latinos living in Arizona (studied as part of Proyecto Ver) and Latinos living in Baltimore (evaluated in the ProVision study funded by the NIH). The barriers and enablers of obtaining cataract surgical services will be assessed in all three racial/ethnic groups, whereas factors related to screening for diabetic retinopathy will be addressed using the two Latino populations, supplemented with analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Finally, the rates of glaucoma screening provided using the Medicare screening benefit as well as the rates and patterns of treatment of glaucoma will be assessed using data from Medicare. Additionally, NHANES has both visual field and optic nerve imaging and these data will be used to determine associations with having been diagnosed with glaucoma when it is present in order to identify groups at high risk for underdiagnosis. The proposed TRC network combined project will consist of establishing diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening surveillance systems in collaboration with city governments to be able to monitor patterns of care, especially among at risk underserved populations. An intervention will be tested to increase DR screening rates based on the findings of the analyses described above. Finally, a pre/post assessment will be made to see if the intervention might be expanded nationally.              Project Narrative This study is highly relevant to the public health. Findings from this research will inform policy planners and insurance administrators of key barriers and enablers associated with the major blinding eye conditions faced by minority populations in the United States.

"Acculturation and physical activity: Forecasting and improving Latino health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to expand the UCLA Health Forecasting Tool (UCLA HFT) to examine drivers of health and longevity in Latinos in California compared to other ethnic/racial groups, and to elucidate the contribution of acculturation, as defined by time lived in the U.S. and age at immigration to the U.S., on rates of disease and death. The proposed project will analyze causes of disparities and the mitigating effects of physical activity interventions on health outcomes and disparities. This research will facilitate more proactive and effective policy responses to California's changing demographic profile and related changes in population health outcomes, and will serve as a model for other regions of the country where similar demographic shifts are expected. The project will also demonstrate methodology for generating sound, evidence-based estimates of the potential impact of large-scale implementation of health interventions.  Disparities in morbidity and mortality exist between and within racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Overall, Latinos in California exhibit lower mortality rates than non-Latinos, however disaggregation into subgroups based on the age of immigration and number of years in the U.S. permits a more robust understanding of complex disparities in morbidity. Despite better overall health outcomes, as Latinos spend more time in the U.S. they are more likely to be obese and have diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease than most other sub-populations. The rapid increase in the Latino population, expected to become the largest ethnic group in California by 2020, along with a health profile that deteriorates with time spent in the U.S., adds urgency to better understanding how health outcomes may evolve and how programs and policies may be used to improve future health outcomes.  The UCLA HFT, which has been developed over the course of seven years, comprehensively evaluates and forecasts future health outcomes associated with preventable and/or reducible ill-health and injury in California. The UCLA HFT uses micro stimulation to model individuals' health over the entire life span. It incorporates data on demographics, behavioral risk factors and other determinants of health, related disease and health conditions. Most important is its ability to evaluate a broad range of policy alternatives that can improve population health and modify disparities. We propose to expand the UCLA HFT to (1) incorporate information on the migration of Latinos in California, including the length of time they have been in the U.S., (2) estimate future trends in the incidence rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mortality, (3) examine mortality, disease and risk factor trends in relation to physical inactivity, smoking and obesity for Latinos in California compared to other ethnic/racial groups, (4) analyze the contribution of differential health behaviors on health disparities among Latinos and other groups, and (5) estimate the effects of several evidence-based interventions, designed to increase physical activity, on the health of Latinos and disparities in health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disparities in health are seen between and within ethnic groups. Notably, Latinos exhibit disparities associated with place of birth and time lived in the United States. We will examine the causes of these disparities through the use of a computer-based simulation model, estimate future changes in the health of Californians that take into account migration patterns, and compare the potential for different interventions that promote physical activity to improve the health of Latinos living in California.           Project Narrative (2-3 sentence layperson summary):  Disparities in health are seen between and within ethnic groups.

"Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dramatic increase in the population of Latinos-the largest minority group in the U.S.-over the last decade and challenges Latinos face in terms of accessing health care in the U.S. make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors and issues that affect Latino health disparities in the U.S. Our long term goal is to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventually elimination of Latino health disparities, especially those in HIV/AIDS and substance abuse. The objectives of the proposed P20 Center of Excellence-NCMHD Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the U.S. -are: (1) Conducting original research exploring the role of behavioral and social factors contributing to or influencing minority health and health disparities; (2) Translating research findings into effective interventions for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (3) Conducting original research exploring the efficacy of a full range of health promotion and information dissemination approaches for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (4) Establishing innovative partnerships between academic institutions and community groups/organizations; and (5) to increase the number of researchers and professionals who are committed to eliminating health disparities, especially those from minority and medically under-served populations. The proposed Center will expand the activities of two R24 Centers of Excellence in Florida International University (FIU), the largest four-year Hispanic Serving Institution in the U.S. It will build on an existing collaboration between FIU and two community-based organizations: SPECTRUM, the oldest and largest non-profit substance abuse treatment agency in South Florida, and Miami Behavioral Health Center, the largest provider of behavioral healthcare services to Latinos in Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: administrative, research, research education/ training, and community engagement/outreach. Its study population will be the Latino population in Miami-Dade County, the only county in the U.S. with an immigrant majority, 97 percent of which are Latinos. The contributions of the Center are significant, since the Center will fill in the need to conduct research that bridges HIV/AIDS and substance use, enhance trust between the researchers and the community, and produce a cadre of scientists conducting research on health disparities-especially those from Latino and other minority and medically under-served populations. Relevance to Public Health: The Center is expected to lead to development and refinement of culturally relevant and evidence-based HIV prevention strategies available to HIV-uninfected/ infected individuals and users of substances among the Latinos, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS and substance abuse epidemics in the U.S.          ",Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States,7885320,P20MD002288,[''],NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,P20,2010,1596295,0.022119022647667984
"San Diego Partnership to Reduce Diabetes and CVD in Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The San Diego Latino Research Center of Excellence is a tri-lateral collaboration that seeks to promote and expedite research that improves cardiovascular disease outcomes in low-income Latinos living in the border region of San Diego. San Diego State University (SDSU) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) represent two large research intensive universities, one with a school of public health and the other with a school of medicine, but both with experience and interest in community based research and training. The San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC) is a large, predominantly Latino-serving community health center that provides services to disadvantaged patients. Together, these organizations will build on existing relationships to conduct epidemiologic, behavioral, and genetic research in an effort to improve the care being delivered to indigent Latinos at risk for and having CVD. Investigators and staff at these three institutions will be referred to as the San Diego Partnership Staff. The San Diego Latino Research Center of Excellence proposes to focus on the disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors experienced by low-income Latinos living in the San Diego border region. The center will conduct rigorous community-based research that will primarily lead to reduction in disparities for disadvantaged populations, and at the same time provide improved service to the community, answer important biomedical questions, build research capacity in the community, and stimulate and train investigators in CVD disparities. The goals of the San Diego Latino Center of Excellence are: Goal 1: Conduct research that will reduce CVD disparities in a predominantly Latino community through culturally and linguistically appropriate applications of the ADA and NCEP guidelines Goal 2: Strengthen the infrastructure for minority health and health disparities research and training at SDSU, UCSD, and SYHC Goal 3: Increase the number of minority investigators engaged in cardiovascular disparities research Goal 4: Strengthen the research infrastructure at a community site, SYHC, thereby increasing the potential for university-community partnerships in which research is conducted.          ",San Diego Partnership to Reduce Diabetes and CVD in Latinos,7858205,P20MD002293,[''],NIMHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,P20,2010,2112185,0.03267431653586671
"Increasing the Pipeline: Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to increase the proportion of Latinos in cancer control research, particularly in the Southwestern U.S., by establishing a Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research (LTPCCR) that will motivate Latino master's-level students and health professionals to complete doctoral programs and careers as cancer control researchers. The LTPCCR is modeled after an evidence-based training model entitled, Minority Training Program in Cancer Control Research (MTPCCR) that targeted a spectrum of ethnic groups in California. Specifically, the LTPCCR will recruit an annual cohort of 20 Latino master's-level students or master's-trained health professionals. An innovation of the LTPCCR is that it targets a single ethnic minority - Latinos/Hispanics who will come from the Southwestern U.S. and Oklahoma. It will provide four interventions along the pipeline from masters-level to doctoral-level training, including: a) a Summer Institute for all participants, b) 9 annual paid summer internships in cancer disparities research (Y2-5), c) 3 annual Doctoral Application Support Awards and d) a Doctoral Student Retreat. Lastly, it will demonstrate an enrollment rate in doctoral programs that exceeds Latino enrollment achieved by the previous MTPCCR. We anticipate a minimum annual Latino enrollment of at least 15% (a 33% increase over that achieved by the MTPCCR). Additional we expect at least 50% of doctoral students reporting cancer control as their research focus and the majority of doctoral students indicating that the Texas program had a strong positive influence on these academic goals. Other benchmarks for success include a significant increase in self-efficacy and in participants' intention to apply to a doctoral program after attending the Summer Institute; and a minimum of 65% of participants rating each session as excellent.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite private and governmental support for programs that encourage Latinos to move through the pipeline from high school to college to research in basic sciences and medicine, there has been little investment in the social and behavioral sciences that send cancer control researchers out into communities to conduct epidemiologic, communication, and behavioral research.

"Life Course Socioeconomics, Acculturation, & Type-2 Diabetes Risk Among Latinos Latinos in the US carry a disproportionate burden of type-2 diabetes. Research has  implicated life course socioeconomic position as a major factor in the development of  chronic diseases, such as type-2 diabetes; yet most evidence is limited to non-Hispanic  White populations. We hypothesize that the large disparities in type-2 diabetes among  Latinos reflects the joint effect of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic  factors, cultural characteristics, behaviors, biology, and other risk factors accumulating  over the life course. The experience of Latinos in the US represents an especially fruitful  context in which to investigate the influence of life course socioeconomic and cultural  resources in relation to type-2 diabetes. In addition to being the fastest growing minority  population with high rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes, the experience of Latinos is  one that includes first generation immigrants with limited education and job skills, and  later generations who were born and raised in the US showing varying levels of  acculturation and assimilation, behavioral change, and socioeconomic advancement.  With these unique considerations in mind, the present study seeks to: (1) Examine the  impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos, (2)  Assess whether acculturation modifies the impact of life course socioeconomic position  on type-2 diabetes among Latinos, and 3) Examine whether metabolic, immune, and  inflammatory markers related to health behaviors and stress mediate the relationships  between life course socioeconomic position, acculturation and type-2 diabetes among  Latinos. The proposed research activity will constitute the first systematic attempt to  assess the unique and synergistic contributions of life course socioeconomic position  and acculturation on type-2 diabetes among Latinos. By assessing life course  exposures, this project provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify targets for  early intervention for reducing the heavy burden of type-2 diabetes among Latinos in the  US. More broadly, the proposed research may uncover crucial life course socioeconomic  and cultural patterning of risk factors or health promoting characteristics that may also  benefit other race/ethnic minorities disproportionately living in poverty and suffering from  type-2 diabetes. The proposed study will assess the impact of life course socioeconomic position and  acculturation on type 2 diabetes and examine potential biological mediators, including  inflammation. The findings from this study will have important public health implications,  including identification of critical biological mechanisms mediating the effects of life  course sociocultural contexts on type 2 diabetes across several generations of US  Latinos.","Life Course Socioeconomics, Acculturation, & Type-2 Diabetes Risk Among Latinos",8038521,R56DK087864,"['Cultural Characteristics ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Biological ', ' Inflammation ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Research Activity ', ' Immigrant ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Metabolic ', ' Poverty ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Life ', ' Stress ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' skills ', ' Generations ', ' Assimilations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' inflammation marker ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R56,2010,207732,0.1158866334419653
"A Church-Based, Self-Management Intervention for Mexican-Americans with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term research objective is to become a nationally respected, independent community-based researcher, with a specific focus on using faith-based interventions to reduce diabetes disparities among Latinos. Diabetes is a very prevalent and morbid condition affecting Latinos, especially Mexican-Americans in the United States. Many church-based interventions have shown promise improving health outcomes among minority populations; but data on church-based interventions for Latino populations is scarce. Considering that the church is a center of Latino family and culture, interventions based in churches has promise to have great impact on this population.

"Nuestro Futoro Saludable: The JP Partnership for Healthy Caribbean Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Through a community-based participatory research partnership, we will plan for, develop, implement, evaluate and disseminate an intervention to address health disparities in the Caribbean Latino population in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts. The Specific Aims of this project are: (1) To establish a community advisory board to guide the development, implementation and dissemination of an intervention that is culturally appropriate and community specific. (2) Assure that community needs, advisory board recommendations, and steering committee decisions and actions are aligned. (3) We will a) determine the specific disease/chronic condition to serve as the basis for intervention and b) identify appropriate aspects of the built environment to be targeted by the intervention; and (4) We will a) design and pilot test a community-level disease-specific intervention to address deficiencies and maximize any existing advantages in the built environment, and/or to mitigate the direct and/or indirect effects of the built environment on health, b) conduct both a process and outcome evaluation of the intervention, and c) disseminate findings and develop a full intervention trial. Latinos are and will remain the country's largest minority group well into the future. In the northeast Caribbean Latinos (Puerto Ricans and Dominicans) represent the largest segment of the Latino population. Because of the youthfulness of the demographic, Latino children/youth are a priority age group. By addressing the causes of health disparities among Latino children and youth early and life, it is possible to provide children with living environments and social conditions conducive to good health, which can create pathways to health as opposed to disparities. This project is significant because, (1) it is a within-group intervention research project targeting a not well-understood sub-population of the Latino demographic; (2) the project is unique because it brings together a diverse group of community stakeholders; (3) key personnel are primarily people of color, with a majority of bilingual Latina women of varying backgrounds; and (4) the project introduces two new investigators of color.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): Characteristics of the built environment can create/sustain health disparities, hence tackling them requires interventions to address macro-level factors that influence health.

"Disseminating Scientific Information on Autism to the Latino Community    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses broad Challenge Area (15): Translational Science and Specific Challenge Topic 15-NR-101: NIH Partners in Research Program: Pathways for Translational Research. Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) represent a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that cause significant impairments in language, learning, thinking and social communication. Findings of racial, cultural, and linguistic (RCL) disparities in access to services for children and adults with disabilities are consistent regardless of the service system being accessed. Specific findings show that children with ASD from culturally and linguistically diverse families have more difficulty accessing services, are diagnosed later than their mainstream counterparts and receive a different mix of services. Studies suggest that these disparities are multi-factorial in nature, but most studies indicate that a ""lack of information"" is reported by consumers from all ethnic groups. This project utilizes theories of health communication and relationship-oriented social marketing strategies to develop and field-test a prototype for distilling scientific articles on ASD into consumer-friendly audience-defined Science Briefs and to effectively disseminate these informational products to Latino families. The central premise of this work is that strong, robust collaborations between academic institutions and community-based networks serving underserved populations are necessary to create a ""bridge"" infrastructure to translate research findings into formats which are easily accessible and meaningful. The goal is to get scientific information that is understandable and useful into the hands of Latino consumers. Building on our current NIH Partners in Research Program, we propose to use Fiesta Educativa as the bridging entity between the research community and Latino families of children with autism in this translational research effort to 1) Develop and field-test a culturally appropriate consumer-accessible product format for scientific journal articles designed for Latino families with children with ASD; 2) Develop and field-test two ""relationship-oriented"" knowledge transfer strategies specific for the Latino community; 3) Describe the nature of the socio-spatial knowledge networks available to the community of Latino families of children with ASD and how these networks may support or impede knowledge transfer; and 4) Evaluate the impact of the project's Knowledge Transfer interventions. This project focuses on translating scientific information on autism spectrum disorders into everyday language so that Latino families can understand and utilize scientific discoveries in their health decision-making process. Our research is done in partnership with Fiesta Educativa, a community-based education, advocacy, and support organizing serving Latino families who have children with disabilities. Together, we will develop and study the most effective strategies to translate scientific information about autism research and bring it into the hands of consumers, Latino families.

"Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will test the causal effects of social capital on levels and inequalities of children's social and cognitive development during the early elementary years. Social capital here refers to trust and shared expectations embedded in social networks of parents, teachers, and children. For young children, social capital operates primarily through their relationships with their parents, enhancing development through mechanisms of social support and social control. Children from low-income Latino families are a special focus of the study. The research design is experimental: social capital will be manipulated through a well-tested intervention Families and Schools Together (FAST) that will enhance the social capital among parents, teachers, and children through an intensive after-school program and a 2-year follow-up program. The study will include 52 schools in Milwaukee and San Antonio (about 208 teachers and 3,120 first graders and their families), with half the schools randomly selected for the intervention and half serving as controls. The experimental design will permit a strong test of the causal role of social capital. The project will also involve an implementation study intended to illuminate the processes by which social capital is generated and affects child development. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, drawing on sociology, psychology, and economics,and it reflects an ecological perspective that crosses boundaries between families and schools. The study thus responds to the call for research on the Science and Ecology of Early Development. Key aspects of child development will be assessed, including (a) social skills and problem behavior from standardized behavioral ratings by parents; (b) the latter plus academic competence as rated by teachers; and (c) grade retention, attendance rates, and third-grade reading and mathematics scores from school records. Social capital will be measured with repeated surveys of teachers and parents that address the extent of social networks, parent involvement, trust, and shared expectations among parents, between parents and schools, and between parents and children. Data will be analyzed with multilevel statistical models that take account of variation at the individual and school levels of analysis.RELEVANCE. Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, and among the most disadvantaged. Latino families often perceive a sense of distance from the school system, which can create barriers to their children's academic and social development, important dimensions of public health. This study will yield practical as well as scientific insights into the value of increased social capital for development of children among a variety of demographic groups, and particularly those from low-income Latino families.

"Salud y el Exito: Addressing Proven Factors in HIV Prevention for Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Padres Unidos por la Salud y el ¿xito de Nuestros Hijos aims to support Latino parents and schools in their efforts to promote the healthy choices of children, with the goal of reducing behaviors that lead to elevated levels of HIV/AIDS in urban Latino communities. The study is designed to advance efforts to begin HIV prevention early, during the preteen and young adolescent years, before youth establish patterns of behavior that jeopardize their health and success, or ""Salud y ¿xito."" Salud y ¿xito draws on a solid foundation of theoretical and empirical research that underscores the importance of supporting the primary role that parents play in healthy youth development. The study will test a bilingual version of a multi-year parent-mediated intervention, Salud y ¿xito, with primary Spanish- as well as English-speaking Latino parents and youth. This intervention consists of parent education delivered through sets of audio-CDs to promote positive parenting practices, including monitoring, rule setting, communication, and support. In addition, Salud y ¿xito M s, an enhanced version of this parent-mediated approach, will be tested. This enhanced intervention integrates audio-CD parent education with a school-based parent involvement program, PALMS Tools for Latino Family Outreach. These tools facilitate the creation of welcoming environments that encourage parental involvement in their preteens' and young adolescents' academic success and future education planning. This is critical because Latinos experience the highest levels of school dropout and school failure, which are both consequences and risk factors for risky behaviors related to HIV/AIDS. Both intervention components have a common purpose: Promoting positive parenting practices known to foster resiliency and protect youth from risk. The specific aims are to: (1) Enroll and randomly assign 60 urban schools serving high proportions of Latino families to one of three conditions: (a) Salud y ¿xito multi-year parent education; (b) Salud y ¿xito M s parent education supplemented with PALMS; or a (c) comparison condition (health education print materials); (2) Enroll 1600 Latino families with youth from 6th grade classes in the study and conduct telephone parent surveys and youth classroom surveys at baseline; (3)Implement Salud y ¿xito intervention components at schools assigned to the intervention conditions; (4) Conduct youth surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions are effective in reducing risk behaviors and intentions and promoting school attachment and pro-social activities; (5) Conduct parent surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions promote and sustain positive parenting practices; (6) Examine how parenting practices and youth outcomes vary by individual and family characteristics, including gender as well as acculturation; and (7) Examine whether youth outcomes are explained by parenting practices and identify which parenting practices mediate the relationship between experimental condition and youth outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Salud y el ¿xito aims to support Latino parents and schools in their efforts to promote the academic success and healthy choices of children, with the goal of reducing behaviors that lead to elevated levels of HIV/AIDS in urban Latino communities.

"Reducing Cancer Disparaties Among Latinos in Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Texas regional Community Networks Program, Latinos Contra El Cancer, combines innovative research, extensive community outreach, and a multi-faceted training program, all conducted within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) context, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in Latinos, and to build a cadre of competitive health disparities researchers trained in CBPR in three regions of Texas (Houston, El Paso, the Lower Rio Grande Valley). This will be accomplished through the work of three distinct yet complementary cores (Outreach, Research, and Training) to integrate knowledge generation, community health education, and community and researcher capacity building within and across the three sites, building on existing research infrastructures, longstanding relationships, and novel communication systems. The overarching goals of each Core are described below.  The goal of the proposed Outreach Program is to increase the use of evidence-based biomedical and behavioral procedures and interventions to reduce the cancer burden among Latinos in Texas. We will build on existing community partnerships, infrastructure, and programs to develop an Outreach Program that will accomplish this goal through capacity building with community partners and direct health promotion in Latino communities.  The goal of the Research Core - Intervention Study is to develop and evaluate an innovative intervention approach for reducing cancer risk related to the three leading behavioral risk factors for cancer: smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity. The project will focus on participants in a longitudinal study of cancer risk factors among Mexican Americans in Houston (Mexican American Cohort Study).  The goal of the Research Core - Pilot Study is to utilize quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the socio-demographic, acculturation, and psychosocial factors that influence Mexican Americans willingness to provide biologic specimens for biobanking.  The goal of the mentored Training Program is to prepare a cadre of new and early stage investigators to conduct cancer disparities research in Latino communities, with a particular emphasis on building skills and capacity to conduct community-based participatory research.              Latinos Contra El Cancer combines innovative research, extensive community outreach, and a multi-faceted training program, all conducted within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) context, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in Latinos, and to build a cadre of competitive health disparities researchers trained in CBPR in three regions of Texas (Houston, El Paso, the Lower Rio Grande Valley).",Reducing Cancer Disparaties Among Latinos in Texas,8008524,U54CA153505,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U54,2010,821633,0.04296226760927538
"Complementary & Alternative Care Behavior in HIV+ Latinos in the US-Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos in the United States (US) - Mexico border region. HIV-positive Latinos in the US face substantial health disparities when compared to non- Latino Whites, including delayed care entry/entering care with advanced HIV disease and they are disproportionately impacted by HIV-stigma and poor patient-provider communication. CAM use (e.g. herbal therapies, alternative healers, and spirituality/religious practices) may be implicated in disparities (e.g. low antiretroviral therapy (ARVs) adherence). Study aims and hypotheses are: Aim 1: To assess CAM-specific health care behavior, including bi-national CAM utilization from allied/alternative health personnel (e.g. pharmacists, non-Western medicine healers) among HIV-positive Latinos residing in Tijuana and San Diego. Hypothesis 1 (H1) Greater use of CAM will be observed among HIV-positive Latinos who report a) crossing the U.S. border more frequently, and b) having migrated to Tijuana or San Diego (e.g. from southern Mexico). Aim 2: To assess use of CAM in the context of HIV treatment utilization and practices, including factors related to delayed entry into HIV care (e.g. HIV stigma); and utilization of and adherence to ARVs among HIV-positive Latinos residing in Tijuana or San Diego. H2.a) Compared to HIV-positive Latinos who report using herbal CAM, those who do not use herbal CAM are more likely to be receiving ARVs and report higher levels of adherence to ARVs; H2.b) Compared to HIV-positive Latinos who do not attend religious services regularly, those who attend religious services regularly are more likely to be receiving ARV; H2.c) Compared to HIV- positive Latinos who report experiencing HIV-related stigma, those who do not report experiencing HIV-related stigma are significantly more likely to be receiving ARV. Aim 3: To determine perceived barriers to communicating use of CAM and ARV adherence to clinicians among HIV-positive Latinos residing in Tijuana or San Diego, including satisfaction with clinician communication, concern about clinician response to reporting CAM use and perception of ARV efficacy; H3) Among CAM users, disclosure of CAM use will be higher among Latino patients who report higher satisfaction with clinician communication than among those who report lower satisfaction. Aim 4: To explore provider and system barriers to culturally-effective communication about CAM and ARV adherence in HIV+ Latinos. In Aims 1-3 we will conduct quantitative, interviewer-administered surveys with 200 HIV+ Latinos (100 from each side of the border). Aim 4 will assess clinician perspectives on CAM through interviews with 20 HIV clinicians on both sides of the border. This study will reduce health disparities in US Latinos by improving culturally-effective clinician communication and will lead to interventions to increase adherence to ARVs and improved health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos on the San Diego/Tijuana border. CAM use among US Latinos living with HIV is associated with delayed utilization of and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapies (ARVs) that may exacerbate health disparities in HIV care access and health outcomes. This study will lead to development of culturally-effective interventions to improve access and adherence to HIV care in Latinos who face health disparities.

"Student Provider Perceptions of Latino Patients in Cancer Care Settings    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed study is to develop and evaluate an instrument to assess racial/ethnic discriminatory attitudes, beliefs and behavior among future healthcare providers. Data collected will be used to identify and describe discriminatory behavior toward Latinos among medical and nursing students in the context of cancer care. This is an innovative application with an important research population with previously tested data collection methods. Few if any studies have been conducted with this population regarding readiness to treat Latino populations.   The project will use a web-based survey that will assess medical and nursing student   knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors toward Latino patients receiving cancer education,   screening, and treatment. Survey participants will be approximately 946 medical and nursing students   from four educational institutions in South Carolina and Georgia. The instrument will assess student   readiness to treat Latinos in cancer care settings as well as comfort with Latinos, cultural competence   with Latinos, attitudes/beliefs toward Latinos, knowledge of Latinos, knowledge of cancer in Latinos,   language proficiency and previous experience with Latinos. A preliminary draft of the survey instrument   based on expert review, existing instruments and pilot data collected by the research team is   appended. Specific aims of the project are to: 1) Develop and refine a survey instrument to assess medical and nursing student knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and behaviors toward Latino patients receiving cancer education, screening, and treatment; 2) Assess the instrument's psychometric properties;3) Assess medical and nursing students' readiness to treat Latinos in cancer care settings as well as other index measures; 4) Examine relationships between medical and nursing student readiness to treat Latinos in cancer care settings with index measures of cultural competency, comfort with Latinos ,attitudes and beliefs toward Latinos, knowledge of Latinos, Spanish proficiency and experience with Latinos. Examining the knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of future health care providers toward Latino patients can inform the design of focused and effective interventions in medical and nursing education. Because Latinos are a relatively new population in the Southeast, interventions should be developed that are appropriate to the needs of the region.      Public Health Relevance: The development of a well-designed survey instrument to assess nursing and medical students' readiness to treat Latino patients will provide a useful research tool for future   studies in health disparities.

"A Cultural Approach to the Study of Latino Parenting    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Latino children and adolescents have higher rates of behavior problems and academic failure compared with chilldren and adolescents from other ethnic groups. The developmental outcomes of Latino youth appear to be related to family functioning variables and to parenting practices in particular. Yet, there is limited understanding of Latino parenting and of the relation between Latino parenting and child outcomes. The purpose of this application is to study Latino parenting of preschool-aged children using a culturally informed framework of parenting that focuses on cultural childrearing values and Latina mothers' value-driven behavior in different cultural contexts, as well as a traditional framework of parenting, to predict child behavior and pre-academic functioning. An understanding of parenting practices that are predictive of child behavioral and pre-academic functioning in Latino preschoolers is critical in the design of preventive interventions that enhance functioning among Latino preschoolers by promoting specific parenting practices.  Such services are key in addressing mental health disparities seen between Latino and non-Latino youth. To accomplish these goals, a career development plan will focus on training for the Candidate in: 1) culturally informed research, 2) ethnographic methodology, 3) behavioral observation and coding of parentchild interactions, and 4) statistical methods and analyses related to measure development, qualitative studies, model testing, and prevention trials. Training will be accomplished through formal coursework, individual tutorials with mentors and consultants, and participation in conferences on relevant topjcs.  Moreover, this training plan will be supplemented by a research plan that includes a qualitative study of cultural childrearing values that will be used for measurement development and a quantitative study of Latino parenting, assessed from both cultural and traditional perspectives, and its relation to child behavior and pre-academic functioning.

"Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) that will focus on reducing cardiovascular disease risk among Latinos in East Los Angeles, California (East L.A.). East L.A. is an urban community with high rates of obesity-related chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke. East L.A. is over 96% Latino; 85% of whom have Mexican ancestry and the rest come mainly from Central America. Our primary objective is to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in this under-served area. To accomplish this objective, we have three integrated, complementary projects, two cores, and a Training and Career Development Program. We will use a community-based participatory approach to implement family and neighborhood environment interventions, along with the collection of physiological data that will examine risk in individuals and across generations. The intervention components include several dimensions that affect health outcomes - personal & family factors, systems factors, and environmental factors. Project 1 is an intensive home environment intervention involving families, of which one member is a high-risk case newly enrolled in a local diabetes care clinic. Project 2 will examine vascular function and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers for individuals varying in generational and immigrant status, to increase the understanding of the basis for the Latino acculturation paradox in CVD risk. Project 3 will conduct make overs of comer stores to enable them to market and provide healthier food options, as well as enable them to serve as a venue for training community members about healthier food options and meal preparation strategies. The center will also capitalize on the inclusion of both promotoras and public health rookies in intervention activities. The public health rookies will be adolescents recruited from a public high school in the community. The two cores provide administrative and research methods resources to the projects, and the Training and Career Development Program will provide resources and infrastructure to provide a pipeline for the public health rookies and will train and mentor graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty on the use of interdisciplinary, disparities-reduction research.          ",Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.,7867028,P50HL105188,[''],NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2010,1996450,0.007238358968120095
"Cuentos de la Vida: Exploring Cultural Heritage through Storytelling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections  indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008).  Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003).  Concomitant with this population growth is a pressing need to address significant social-emotional, behavioral, and academic disparities between Latino children and non-Latino white children (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005). Perceptions of a closed school community have been found to create or exacerbate problems with academic performance, educational aspirations, and behavioral-emotional functioning for Latino youth (Romero and Roberts, 2003; Szalacha et al., 2003; Vega et al., 1995). Intervention and prevention research suggests social acceptance of Latino students and integration into the school community are key environmental factors that promote positive functioning (Ibaqez et al., 2004; Suarez-Orozco and Suarez-Orozco, 1995; Valencia, 2002). The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to continue the research and development of a school-based cultural heritage curriculum for upper elementary school students, Cultural Heritage Stories for Kids: Latino Series (hereafter CHSK:LS), to create the full product, including a story library of traditional and acculturation stories from different Latino cultures (e.g., Mexican American, Puerto Rican,  Cuban), presented by professional Latino storytellers in both English and Spanish. CHSK:LS will provide school professionals with an innovative effective universal classroom intervention specifically designed to celebrate Latino cultural heritage, promote understanding of cultural diversity in the classroom, and engender a more integrated, accepting classroom environment. During Phase I, the CHSK:LS prototype materials were evaluated very positively by school professionals as well as parents and children. However, specific suggestions for Phase II development were noted. The first aim of Phase II will be to revise and extend based on the feedback attained during Phase I, Phase II stakeholder input, and expert advice of Advisory Board members. Once the CHSK:LS product is completed, the second aim of Phase II will be to conduct a rigorous test of the product efficacy via a randomized treatment-control experimental design assessing change as a function of participation in CHSK-LS for two sets of outcomes: (a) individual student-level social, behavioral, emotional, and academic functioning at school and (b) overall classroom climate. The third aim will be to the finalize all product materials based on Phase II findings and evaluations from product testing, package all components for commercialization, and ready the product for  broad-scale dissemination through our commercialization partner. The proposed Phase II SBIR project will result in a highly innovative intervention package with substantial competitive advantages, providing schools with a much needed evidence-based intervention package to promote multicultural awareness and integration, and address behavioral health disparities for Latino students.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections  indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008).  Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003). From 1993 to 2003, the number of minority school enrollments increased from 34 to 41 percent, with Latino students accounting for the majority of that increase (6 percentage points; NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007). Compared  to non-Latino white children, Latino children are at profoundly greater risk for a wide variety of academic  problems (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005), including lower school engagement, grades,  and test scores (NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007; NCES Status and Trends in Edu of Hisp, 2003). In addition, perceived discrimination and insecurity about ethnic identity has been linked to externalizing behavior problems, increased depressive symptoms, and diminished self-esteem (Umaqa-Taylor and Updegraff, 2007, Vega et al., 1995). Culturally specific factors, such as a cultural mismatch between the home and school community, low school integration, and negative stereotyping, have been shown to contribute to decreased school performance (Kroth, 2009; USDEd, 2000; Viadero, 2000). Further, an increasingly frustrating school environment for Latino students can foster high levels of absenteeism and school dropout rates. Nearly 50 percent of Latino students do not graduate from high school (Orfield et al., 2004). Dropping out of school, in turn, has serious consequences for Latino youth, placing them at risk for unemployment, reduced income, diminished health outcomes, use of public assistance, and increased likelihood for delinquent, criminal, and risk-taking behaviors (see Sweeten et al., 2009). Furthermore, the financial costs to society of school dropout are great.  Approximately 600,000 youth drop out of high school each year in the Unites States (Muennig, 2000). It has been estimated that if those students had completed their high school diplomas instead, states could save more than $2.3 billion in public insurance utilization and student gains in lifetime earnings could be as much as $72 billion dollars (Muennig, 2000).          The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections  indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008).

"PictureRx: An Intervention to Reduce Latino Health Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major health disparities in chronic disease control and outcomes exist among Latinos, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. If these disparities continue, demographic trends will magnify their adverse health, societal, and economic impact. Chronic disease control often requires successful management of multiple prescription medications, yet many patients struggle to understand medication information, which contributes to poor adherence and outcomes. The situation is particularly challenging for Latino patients, the majority of whom have low health literacy and/or limited English proficiency. Medication instructions that incorporate illustrations and plain language have been proven to enhance medication management, particularly among patients with low health literacy. However, few tools have been developed to generate such instructions in a way that could be delivered to Latino and other underserved populations. PictureRx is an innovative, effective, affordable, evidence-based technology which enables patients, their caregivers, or health professionals to rapidly develop illustrated medication instructions. The PictureRx platform, which is available in English via the internet, is well-suited for adaptation to serve the needs of the Latino community, where it may enhance medication management and reduce health disparities.  The Specific Aims of this proposal are to: 1) Adapt PictureRx into a Spanish-language, culturally appropriate educational intervention for improving medication management and outcomes among Latinos, and 2) Conduct a small randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effect of the Spanish-language PictureRx, compared to traditional prescription instructions, on Latinos' knowledge of their medication regimens.  The project team consists of experienced software engineers and academic physicians with expertise in business development and clinical research among underserved populations. For Aim 1, we will conduct focus groups and interviews with Latino patients, their caregivers, and health care professionals, as well as leading national experts who have agreed to serve as key informants. We will use this information in an iterative fashion to adapt PictureRx for the Latino community. For Aim 2, we will enroll 200 patients in a randomized study at the Cayce Clinic, a safety net clinic which primarily serves Latino patients. Patients in the intervention group will receive PictureRx illustrated schedules of their daily medication regimen, while those in the control group will receive usual care. The study will evaluate the effect of PictureRx on Latino patients' understanding of their medication regimen (primary outcome), as well as their self-reported adherence (secondary outcome).  Through a process of development and evaluation which engages the Latino community, our goal is to complete a culturally-appropriate and effective adaptation of PictureRx for Latinos. This will set the stage for subsequent efforts to disseminate PictureRx as an appropriate technology to reduce health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine and this SBIR announcement have called for innovative approaches to reduce health disparities.

"Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos have been consistently found to underutilize formal mental health services and are less likely to receive quality care for mental and behavioral disorders compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Efficacious treatments for mental disorders are available, but dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions for Latinos is limited. An annual LBHI Conference for five years is proposed to improve the exchange of scientific findings and enhance collaboration among 1000 attendees annually representing researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, consumers and their families. The conference sessions will provide findings on evidence-based interventions across the life span, and sessions that address the contextual issues (e.g., culturally and linguistically relevant program approaches, community characteristics, system-level barriers and interventions), and process issues (e.g. engagement strategies) that are critical to addressing the disparities in service access and utilization. The Conferences are a collaborative effort between LBHI and national, state, county and community partners to provide a forum for the exchange of information on the distinctive mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, and resilience issues of Latinos. They are also designed to provide a forum for developing strategic partnerships and community participation to support research capacity relevant to Latino mental health. The Conferences support, as attendees, investigators at the pre-doctoral, post-doctoral, and early investigator levels to stimulate their interest in Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the Latino organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. LBHI will convene a national strategic planning process to identify the: 1) information needs of target attendees regarding evidence-based interventions in Latino service settings and 2) effective dissemination and implementation mechanisms to address conference objectives. Barriers to effective dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions into Latino service settings will be addressed by the Conferences through the following objectives. The annual Conference will: (1) result in enhanced capacity of researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, and consumers and their families to collaborate in the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions in service settings for Latinos; (2) increase the capacity to conduct research in Latino mental health service settings through the formation of strategic partnerships, community engagement and the submission of NIH grant applications; and, (3) increase investigator knowledge and interest in addressing Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. The Latino Behavioral Health Institute (LBHI) proposes a series of five annual conferences designed to enhance behavioral health services to the Latino community, the fastest growing, and yet in terms of mental health services, the most underserved population in the United States. The purpose of the annual conferences is to facilitate the exchange of scientific information and clinical experience among the over 1000 attendees including researchers, clinicians, policy makers, consumers and their families. By improving the link between research and clinical practice, the LBHI conferences aim to provide participants with the knowledge and skills to decrease the disparities in mental health service utilization among Latinos and improve the overall health and mental health of the largest minority group in the United States.          ",Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference,7903073,R13MH078724,"['Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Institutes ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Recovery ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' United States ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' interest ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' County ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Latino ', ' behavioral health ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' clinical practice ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Advocate ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Family ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' ']",NIMH,LATINO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INSTITUTE,R13,2010,23911,0.04588180892476277
"Complementary & Alternative Care Behavior in HIV+ Latinos in the US-Mexico    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos in the United States (US) - Mexico border region. HIV-positive Latinos in the US face substantial health disparities when compared to non- Latino Whites, including delayed care entry/entering care with advanced HIV disease and they are disproportionately impacted by HIV-stigma and poor patient-provider communication. CAM use (e.g. herbal therapies, alternative healers, and spirituality/religious practices) may be implicated in disparities (e.g. low antiretroviral therapy (ARVs) adherence). Study aims and hypotheses are: Aim 1: To assess CAM-specific health care behavior, including bi-national CAM utilization from allied/alternative health personnel (e.g. pharmacists, non-Western medicine healers) among HIV-positive Latinos residing in Tijuana and San Diego. Hypothesis 1 (H1) Greater use of CAM will be observed among HIV-positive Latinos who report a) crossing the U.S. border more frequently, and b) having migrated to Tijuana or San Diego (e.g. from southern Mexico). Aim 2: To assess use of CAM in the context of HIV treatment utilization and practices, including factors related to delayed entry into HIV care (e.g. HIV stigma); and utilization of and adherence to ARVs among HIV-positive Latinos residing in Tijuana or San Diego. H2.a) Compared to HIV-positive Latinos who report using herbal CAM, those who do not use herbal CAM are more likely to be receiving ARVs and report higher levels of adherence to ARVs; H2.b) Compared to HIV-positive Latinos who do not attend religious services regularly, those who attend religious services regularly are more likely to be receiving ARV; H2.c) Compared to HIV- positive Latinos who report experiencing HIV-related stigma, those who do not report experiencing HIV-related stigma are significantly more likely to be receiving ARV. Aim 3: To determine perceived barriers to communicating use of CAM and ARV adherence to clinicians among HIV-positive Latinos residing in Tijuana or San Diego, including satisfaction with clinician communication, concern about clinician response to reporting CAM use and perception of ARV efficacy; H3) Among CAM users, disclosure of CAM use will be higher among Latino patients who report higher satisfaction with clinician communication than among those who report lower satisfaction. Aim 4: To explore provider and system barriers to culturally-effective communication about CAM and ARV adherence in HIV+ Latinos. In Aims 1-3 we will conduct quantitative, interviewer-administered surveys with 200 HIV+ Latinos (100 from each side of the border). Aim 4 will assess clinician perspectives on CAM through interviews with 20 HIV clinicians on both sides of the border. This study will reduce health disparities in US Latinos by improving culturally-effective clinician communication and will lead to interventions to increase adherence to ARVs and improved health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos on the San Diego/Tijuana border. CAM use among US Latinos living with HIV is associated with delayed utilization of and poor adherence to antiretroviral therapies (ARVs) that may exacerbate health disparities in HIV care access and health outcomes. This study will lead to development of culturally-effective interventions to improve access and adherence to HIV care in Latinos who face health disparities.           Project Narrative The goal of our community-based participatory research study is to identify the nature and extent of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among HIV-positive Latinos on the San Diego/Tijuana border.

"A Partnership Approach to Reducing HIV Disparities Among Latino Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern United States has the fastest growing Latino population in the country and carries a disproportionate HIV/AIDS disease burden. We propose a 5-year study (R24) to fully implement and rigorously evaluate a piloted lay health advisor (LHA) intervention designed to reduce risk of HIV infection among recently arrived, monolingual, less-acculturated Latino men who are settling in the Southeast. The intervention is based on social cognitive theory and the theory of empowerment education and was developed using community-based participatory research (CBPR). This study is a result of a long-term community-university partnership that has used and will continue to use CBPR throughout all phases of the research process.      A total of 20 Latino soccer teams in rural NC will be randomized to an LHA-led HIV prevention intervention or a delayed-intervention comparison group. One man from each of the intervention teams (n=10) will be nominated by his teammates and selected as an LHA in Year 2. The delayed-intervention teams (n=10) will receive the same intervention in Year 3. Quantitative assessment data will be collected from each LHA and 12 of his teammates from each of the 20 teams at: (1) baseline, (2) immediate postintervention, and (3) 12-month follow-up.      Participants in the HIV prevention intervention, relative to their peers in the delayed-intervention comparison group, are anticipated to demonstrate (1) increased self-reported use of condoms during sexual intercourse and (2) increased self-reported utilization of HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD) counseling, testing, and treatment services.      To further evaluate and explore the intervention, qualitative data will be collected using individual in-depth interviews with LHAs and their teammates. We also will evaluate the CBPR process, using direct observation of partnership meetings, in-depth interviews with partners, and partnership document review.      Products from this study will include (1) a Spanish-language intervention that is ready for dissemination and adaptation, culturally relevant and gender-specific, and designed to reduce HIV risk among recently arrived, less-acculturated Latino men; (2) a deeper understanding of HIV risk and intervention among Latino men that will be reported through briefs, newspaper articles, local and national presentations, and manuscripts; and (3) insight into a research partnership process that includes lay community members, Latino soccer leagues and teams, AIDS service organizations, community-based organizations, 3 universities, and a broad spectrum of other partners.          ",A Partnership Approach to Reducing HIV Disparities Among Latino Men,7799129,R24MD002774,"['Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', '

"Family Care of Older Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos age 65 or older have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and more severe complications from the disease, compared to non-Latino Whites. Latino elders' consequent risks for functional impairment and permanent disability raise questions about their family environment and the role caregivers play in helping them to manage the disease. Studying the family environment is important for addressing and eventually eliminating Latinos' health disparities arising from this chronic disease. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to provide mentored research and professional training to prepare me for a career as a federally-funded, independent investigator on health disparities and aging research in the area of family care of older Latinos. My immediate goals are to 1) develop a research program that characterizes the care of older adults within the Mexican-origin family; and 2) develop proficiency in culturally-relevant interventions for Latino elders and their caregivers. I propose to move my research beyond the female caregiver, toward a family level approach to elder care along one specific health dimension, management of type 2 diabetes. The K01 award builds directly on my current work by 1) including the perspectives of caregiving men and diabetic care-receiving elders; and 2) examining the process of family elder care through observation of caregiver-care receiver dyads (CG-CR dyad) in home settings. I propose three phases of research that culminate in developing and evaluating the feasibility of a CG-CR dyad intervention to improve care receiving Latino elders' diabetes outcomes. The training aspect of this award will provide me with in-depth knowledge in: 1) theory development and measurement of family care of Latino elders; 2) observational methods in home settings; and 3) intervention development and evaluation. My long-term objective is to establish a research trajectory based on theoretical and empirical principles that can be applied in real-world settings to improve the health outcomes of community-dwelling Latino elders. The interdisciplinary mentoring team I put together and my affiliations with the UCLA RCMAR and the UCLA School of Public Health provide the infrastructure to support these endeavors.       RELEVANCE: The proposed research focuses on older Latinos, the largest and second fastest aging sub-population in the United States. Many older Latinos have diabetes and suffer severe consequences from the disease, leading to poor health and disability. This research looks at the role of family caregivers in Latino elders' management of diabetes, one step toward finding ways to improve Latino elders' health in this area.           ",Family Care of Older Latinos with Diabetes,7924553,K01AG033122,"['Counseling ', ' Data Collection ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Family Study ', ' Housekeeping ', ' Housework ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interview ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Love ', ' Mexican ', ' diabetic ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Award ', ' Pattern ', ' Location ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' One Step ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Emotional ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family member ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' glucose monitor ', ' glucose meter ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2010,161114,0.09090717886075113
"UPR-CHA Research Center of Excellence: Making a Difference for Latino Health Health and health service disparities are pervasive in asthma and mental disorders in both Puerto Rico and the United States among Latinos. The causes for these disparities are poorly understood and effective interventions to eliminate these disparities are needed. The mission of the proposed University of Puerto Rico-Cambridge Health Alliance Research Center of Excellence (UPR-CHA RCE) is to conduct research on Latino health and health care disparities, specifically mental disorders, substance abuse and asthma, and to generate and test models of improved service delivery to eliminate these disparities. The UPR-CHA RCE will build on the strengths and experiences of the UPR-CHA EXPORT Center. The UPR-CHA RCE is led by an experienced and diverse research team with a long history of collaboration and commitment to the study of service disparities among minority populations. The Center is structured around a Research, Administrative and Training Core. Based on a conceptual model developed by the group, three research projects will test multi-level interventions at the provider, individual/family and policy level to reduce health services disparities in mental disorders and pediatric asthma (Projects 1 and 2) and provide data to understand the magnitude of substance abuse treatment disparities and the social and economic burden of these disparities (Project 3). Two pilot projects open up new areas of research on disparities, one focusing on a low-cost prevention intervention for mothers of asthmatic children at risk for depression (Pilot 1) and another on documenting disparities in the treatment of mentally ill nursing home residents (Pilot 2).   The five aims of the proposed UPR-CHA-RCE are to: 1) Establish an administrative structure that integrates and centralizes a synergistic core of researchers into a single interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary enterprise by pulling together resources, leadership, and expertise from the mainland US and Puerto Rico. 2) Continue to establish, strengthen and maintain partnerships with organizations and communities for conducting original and relevant research leading to improvement in Latino health and in eliminating service disparities. 3) Enhance research and training activities of the ongoing UPR-CHA EXPORT Center to mentor and develop Latino investigators and to increase the number of minority researchers who conduct health disparities research. 4) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary asthma and mental health services and intervention research program to increase our understanding of and eliminate and/or reduce service disparities of Latinos in all stages of their life cycle. 5) Disseminate and integrate the product of these efforts to inform policy decisions, clinical practice and community partners, and orient health service systems to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services.

"Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dramatic increase in the population of Latinos-the largest minority group in the U.S.-over the last decade and challenges Latinos face in terms of accessing health care in the U.S. make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors and issues that affect Latino health disparities in the U.S. Our long term goal is to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventually elimination of Latino health disparities, especially those in HIV/AIDS and substance abuse. The objectives of the proposed P20 Center of Excellence-NCMHD Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the U.S. -are: (1) Conducting original research exploring the role of behavioral and social factors contributing to or influencing minority health and health disparities; (2) Translating research findings into effective interventions for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (3) Conducting original research exploring the efficacy of a full range of health promotion and information dissemination approaches for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (4) Establishing innovative partnerships between academic institutions and community groups/organizations; and (5) to increase the number of researchers and professionals who are committed to eliminating health disparities, especially those from minority and medically under-served populations. The proposed Center will expand the activities of two R24 Centers of Excellence in Florida International University (FIU), the largest four-year Hispanic Serving Institution in the U.S. It will build on an existing collaboration between FIU and two community-based organizations: SPECTRUM, the oldest and largest non-profit substance abuse treatment agency in South Florida, and Miami Behavioral Health Center, the largest provider of behavioral healthcare services to Latinos in Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: administrative, research, research education/ training, and community engagement/outreach. Its study population will be the Latino population in Miami-Dade County, the only county in the U.S. with an immigrant majority, 97 percent of which are Latinos. The contributions of the Center are significant, since the Center will fill in the need to conduct research that bridges HIV/AIDS and substance use, enhance trust between the researchers and the community, and produce a cadre of scientists conducting research on health disparities-especially those from Latino and other minority and medically under-served populations. Relevance to Public Health: The Center is expected to lead to development and refinement of culturally relevant and evidence-based HIV prevention strategies available to HIV-uninfected/ infected individuals and users of substances among the Latinos, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS and substance abuse epidemics in the U.S.          ",Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States,8110309,P20MD002288,"['Mentorship ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Nomads ', ' Migrant ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Newsletter ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Overdose ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' treatment program ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Population Study ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' County ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' flu ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' Consultations ', ' Provider ', ' substance abuse prevention ', ' substance abuse control ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Epidemic ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' International ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' COBRE ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Feedback ', ' Florida ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' minority health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Research Activity ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,P20,2010,300000,0.022119022647667984

"Investing in America's Future: Mentoring Latinos in Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary:  Given the heterogeneity of factors such as culture, acculturation, and socioeconomic status, there is a need for additional research related to cardiovascular health and shared protective and risk factors associated with other chronic diseases specific to Latino subgroups. However, there is an under-representation of Latino scientists and university faculty in the US, which contributes to a limitation in insight among scientists seeking to understand and reverse the negative health disparities experienced by Latino communities. It is thus crucial to train and develop future scientists to increase the body of literature on Latino health and to increase Latino community members' access to culturally competent health information and care. As more Latino researchers are trained, there is greater potential to diversify the workforce and promote culturally sensitive research that encourages the continued inclusion and participation of diverse groups in research studies.  The proposed training program, entitled, ""Investing in America's Future: Mentoring Latinos in Health Disparities Research,"" will bring researchers accomplished in Latino community health research (mentors) together with aspiring younger researchers (mentees) to optimize the chances of research success and advancement among the latter and prepare them in turn to train the next generation of individuals who will be working in Latino health. To advance the scientific career development of the junior Latino faculty and scientists, the proposed team will offer a series of trainings and mentoring activities focused on Latino health and health disparities research as related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other conditions associated with CVD risk factors. These activities, which will involve three separate cohorts of approximately eight Latino mentees each (24 mentees total), will consist of an initial two-week long summer institute, a mid-year visit by a mentor to each of the mentees' research settings, and a second summer institute of one-week, as well as a final meeting of all three cohorts at the conclusion of the study period. Regular communication between mentees and mentors and the provision of a modest stipend to pursue additional training will complement the in-person activities.  The ultimate goal of the program is to equip the junior researchers with the skills necessary to develop manuscripts and submit a grant proposal related to health disparities and CVD within two years of completing the program. The proposed research training program will be evaluated periodically to determine the overall relevance and value of the methods employed. Mentee and mentor feedback will be used to refine the program to best meet the needs of the participants. Further, portions of the program will be disseminated at its conclusion to allow others who are not able to attend to develop productive Latino health research careers using aspects of the training.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative:  There is an under-representation of Latino scientists in the US, which contributes to a narrowing of insights among scientists seeking to understand and reverse the negative health disparities experienced by Latino communities.

"Kansas Community Cancer Health Disparities Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indian and Latino populations suffer from significant cancer disparities. Rural Al and Latino communities, in geographically large states, such as Kansas, experience even greater access to cancer screening and treatment disadvantage due to dispersion of specialists and facilities. The Kansas Community Cancer Disparities Network (KCCDN) headquartered at the University of Kansas Medical Center will concentrate on reaching rural Al and Latinos with innovative programs to improve knowledge, access and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral cancer procedures. Using community based participatory research methods (CBPR) and linking our primary care research network (the Kansas Physicians Engaged in Prevention Research, KPEPR) to our newly formed Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) hospital network, we will improve outreach, research, and training on cancer disparities in two rural counties; Finney County (SW Kansas; Latino) and Brown County (NE Kansas; Al). Our CNP Network will capitalize on thriving research programs offered in our AHECS, Telemedicine Center and safety-net clinic system (Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, KAMU), and it will leverage strong and trusting relationships we have built while providing service and collecting needs assessment data in both the regional Al and Latino communities. Effective, standing community advisory boards (CABs) in each community were consulted directly during the design and planning of this proposal and we have structured a CNP Network governance that assures community interests come first. Our Outreach Core activities will build on the strengths available within the MCA, KPEPR, and the Telemedicine Office and allow for expanded and improved education through promotores, IT resources, and theory-driven strategic communications and a social marketing campaign. With direct input from rural partners we will conduct a rigorous and controlled clinical trial, testing the efficacy of a novel intervention based on the ""implementation intentions"" construct to promote breast cancer screening in Latina and Al women (PI, Engelman). Our Pilot Educational Project will utilize promotores and ties to the MCA network to enhance knowledge, awareness and interest in cancer clinical trials among targeted Al and Latino communities (PI, Cupertino). Our Training Core program will rest on a strong foundation formed by our K30 clinical research curriculum program and an interdisciplinary T-32 fellowship program (PI, Greiner) specifically designed to train health disparities researchers through community-based research activities. Our KCCDN will succeed in reducing cancer disparities for Kansas' rural Latinos and American Indians because it creates a vision for seamless blending access to care enhancements, culturally tailored educational outreach, rigorous research, and junior investigator CBPR training. Using the building blocks already in place, our model program will reach vulnerable minorities and generate disseminable knowledge for the national CNP consortium.           ",Kansas Community Cancer Health Disparities Network,8017664,U54CA154253,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2010,804752,0.07765126136296133
"Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will test the causal effects of social capital on levels and inequalities of children's social and cognitive development during the early elementary years. Social capital here refers to trust and shared expectations embedded in social networks of parents, teachers, and children. For young children, social capital operates primarily through their relationships with their parents, enhancing development through mechanisms of social support and social control. Children from low-income Latino families are a special focus of the study. The research design is experimental: social capital will be manipulated through a well-tested intervention Families and Schools Together (FAST) that will enhance the social capital among parents, teachers, and children through an intensive after-school program and a 2-year follow-up program. The study will include 52 schools in Milwaukee and San Antonio (about 208 teachers and 3,120 first graders and their families), with half the schools randomly selected for the intervention and half serving as controls. The experimental design will permit a strong test of the causal role of social capital. The project will also involve an implementation study intended to illuminate the processes by which social capital is generated and affects child development. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, drawing on sociology, psychology, and economics,and it reflects an ecological perspective that crosses boundaries between families and schools. The study thus responds to the call for research on the Science and Ecology of Early Development. Key aspects of child development will be assessed, including (a) social skills and problem behavior from standardized behavioral ratings by parents; (b) the latter plus academic competence as rated by teachers; and (c) grade retention, attendance rates, and third-grade reading and mathematics scores from school records. Social capital will be measured with repeated surveys of teachers and parents that address the extent of social networks, parent involvement, trust, and shared expectations among parents, between parents and schools, and between parents and children. Data will be analyzed with multilevel statistical models that take account of variation at the individual and school levels of analysis.RELEVANCE. Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, and among the most disadvantaged. Latino families often perceive a sense of distance from the school system, which can create barriers to their children's academic and social development, important dimensions of public health. This study will yield practical as well as scientific insights into the value of increased social capital for development of children among a variety of demographic groups, and particularly those from low-income Latino families.          ",Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study,7821315,R01HD051762,"['Disadvantaged ', ' Low income ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Economics ', ' Address ', ' Social Network ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Affect ', ' Goals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Interview ', ' teacher ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Inequality ', ' Mathematics ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Parents ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Development ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Sociology ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Dimensions ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Country ', ' first grade ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' intervention program ', ' expectation ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' third grade ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' after-school program ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Absenteeism ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' Latino ', ' Modeling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' evidence base ', ' intervention effect ', ' randomized trial ', ' Control Groups ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2010,704294,0.06808873208394509
"Implementing the Health for All Model with Latino Community of Kansas City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to longstanding health disparities in multiple minority populations, there is a deep need for innovative strategies and models that change community conditions and promote health equity.

Using community-based participatory research methods, the project will assure that community members are equal and essential partners in developing, implementing and evaluating interventions focused on reducing health disparities. This project builds on the long-term relationship between the KU Work Group for Community Health and Development, at the University of Kansas, and the Kansas City - Chronic Disease Coalition. The community intervention will be comprised of several key components and elements, including: the creation of a clear vision and mission, logic model, and action plan adapted for the local Latino community; the assurance of intensive supports for the plan's implementation; the hiring of community mobilizers; documentation and review of activities for feedback and improvement; and shared responsibility among scientific and community partners for the project's development, implementation, and evaluation. Community-determined long-term objectives focus on related risk behaviors (e.g., increasing daily fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity levels, cholesterol screen levels, and decreasing obesity). This will be achieved through the implementation of an action plan that puts in place new programs, policies and practices at the community and system levels that affect risk for CVD and diabetes in the Latino community and among organizations that serve Latinos. Data will be collected through ongoing documentation of all project-related activities and accomplishments facilitated by the coalition and its partners and annual surveys of self-reported behaviors among the targeted population. A panel design will be used with additional cross sectional samples for which pre-post comparisons will be conducted. The CBPR study will expand the science and practice of how communities create conditions that promote health and healthy equity.          ",Implementing the Health for All Model with Latino Community of Kansas City,7772354,R24MD002780,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Elements ', ' Data ', ' Community Practice ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feedback ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' working group ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Kansas ', ' Logic ', ' Policies ', ' Mission ', ' Missouri ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' metropolitan ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Communities ', ' community intervention ', ' self reported behavior ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS LAWRENCE,R24,2010,576662,0.07343565726151571
"Redes En Accion: National Latino Cancer Research Network    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Action is urgently needed to address persistent disparities in cancer control and prevention that harm the health of Latino populations.  To meet this need, we propose a comprehensive set of research, education, and training activities to be carried out at the national level and in regional centers in California, Florida, New York, and Texas by an established network of investigators uniquely qualified to understand issues from the perspectives of their diverse populations and to serve as leaders and role models for influencing change and fostering a new generation of Latino scientists and policy advocates.  Research activities will include: 1) development of disparity-related pilot projects for proposals to obtain independent NCI funding for Latino scientists; 2) national, regional, and local policy studies analyzing factors influencing disparities in access to cancer control and prevention, and the capacities of advocates concerned with this issue; and 3) multi-site evaluation of an experimental intervention designed to improve women's capacities for navigating health care systems that provide cancer screening and care.  Education activities at the national and regional levels will include:  1) multi-modal public education and outreach and 2) professional education and outreach for clinical providers and for organizations concerned with policies that influence access to cancer screening and care.  Training activities will consist of mentoring and pilot research support for students and junior scientists developing careers in research aimed at understanding and reducing disparities that affect the cancer health of Latinos.  This work will be conducted in three phases.  In Phase I, network infrastructure will be established, administrative and communications systems go online, and preparations for Phase II activation completed.

"Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Studies in the U.S. and elsewhere have generally shown that higher social position is strongly associated with lower mortality risks and better health at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder. However, the situation for the Latino population is more complex. Despite the poorer socioeconomic status of Latinos, their infant and adult mortality rates are generally the same as or lower than those for whites, a pattern often referred to as the ""Hispanic Paradox."" A second puzzle pertains to findings in the literature that, despite this mortality advantage, Latino survey respondents are more likely than those in other ethnic groups to rate their overall health as fair or poor. Our preliminary research based on three data sets reveals yet another paradox: for a broad range of health-related behaviors and health outcomes, the social gradients in health for Latino youth and adults are weak or virtually non-existent in contrast to the generally strong gradients for whites. In the proposed project, we will systematically investigate the relationships between socioeconomic status, immigrant status, health behavior, and health outcomes for Latinos in the United States. Although our principal focus will be the Latino population, we will also examine these relationships for other ethnic groups. In addition, we will investigate associations between socioeconomic status and health outcomes in Mexico, which is the largest sending country for Latino immigrants in the U.S. Data for the analysis will come from waves 1 and 2 of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, from the National Health Interview Survey, and from the Mexican Encuesta Nacional de Salud. Our overall goal is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Latino health.              ",Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos,7816754,R01HD051764,"['Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Family ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infant ', ' residence ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' African ', ' Literature ', ' Central American ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mexican ', ' Legal Status ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Marmota ', ' Marmots ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mexico ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Native Americans ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Smoking ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Birth Weight ', ' age group ', ' ethnic difference ', ' drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' National origin ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' Accounting ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' biomarker ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2010,420994,0.211954763785763
"CBT for Latinos with Generalized Anxiety Disorder in the General Medical Sector    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  GAD is a prevalent, chronic, and costly mental-health problem associated with decreased functioning, increased health-service utilization, and high risk for subsequent comorbid major depression. Although significant evidence supports the effectiveness of CBT for the treatment of GAD, Latinos have not benefited equally from these advances. Spanish-speaking Latinos have been routinely excluded in both efficacy and effectiveness studies. To address this disparity, it is essential that the benefits of clinical developments in interventions be made available to Spanish-speaking Latinos. This application requests a SCORE SC1 to conduct a randomized, controlled study of a culturally adapted, manualized CBT-based intervention for GAD to obtain preliminary estimates of its efficacy and to generate a treatment effect size estimate that will inform the design of a subsequent adequately-powered randomized controlled trial.

"Differential Delivery of Follow-up Care and Survivorship Among Latinos Using Medi    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Differential Delivery of Follow-up Care and Survivorship Among Latinos Using Medicare This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic, 05-AA-101 Innovative Analyses of Existing Clinical Datasets. Research shows equal access to cancer treatment and supportive care eliminates disparities in outcomes. Latinos comprise 45.5 million people in the US. Although many reports demonstrate Latinos, compared to non-Hispanics, have lower risks of some diseases and death and even have better health behaviors despite having traditional risk factors associated with poor health such as low income and education levels. Paradoxally, Latinos with some cancers are more likely to die sooner than non-Latinos. For example, a Latina woman diagnosed with breast cancer is 22% more likely to die of breast cancer during the 5 years after diagnosis than a non- Latina white woman of the same age with the same stage of disease. This phenomena needs urgent investigation. The reasons for poorer survival in the Latino community are unclear but may reflect poorer access to timely, high quality treatment. Scientists have not studied if the timeliness of cancer and preventative care that Latinos with breast, prostate and stomach cancers receive impacts their survivorship. This study will focus on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer surveillance data linkage to Medicare. First, this study will assess how soon after a diagnosis Latinos receive standard care for breast, prostate and stomach cancers compared to other ethnic groups. Then this study will determine if delays in either cancer care or general preventative health care depends on where Latinos live (i.e. neighborhoods that are poor, without many doctors or where most residents speak only Spanish). Finally, this study will assess if the delays in treatment and care are associated with earlier death in Latinos compared to other ethnic groups. By the end of the 2-year study period, this study will have trained graduate students in health services research providing infrastructure to address the most challenging questions in health care delivery. Society will know barriers that stand in the way of timely and high-quality care for Latino cancer survivors. This research will assist policy makers, the research community and the health care system apply current knowledge about successful treatments equally throughout the population and ultimately reduce disparities between ethnic and racial groups and develop effective targeted interventions and policies to avoid one-size-fits-all policies that perpetuate disparities in cancer survival.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide knowledge about the differential delivery of follow-up care and its impact on survivorship in the Latino population. Policy makers, the research community, and health providers will use this knowledge to provide evidence based delivery of care equally throughout the population.

"End-of-life treatment preferences of Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End of Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Principal Investigator: Isabel Torres, Dr.P.H. The overall goal of the NCI K01 career development plan is to provide the candidate with a program of mentored research activity and study in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and outcomes research to launch an independent research career with specialization in the integration of these research areas. The five-year plan is carefully designed to 1) obtain further research experience in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and health services research; 2) advance skills related to the design and analyses of prospective palliative care studies through training in advanced statistical methods; 3) improve skills needed to develop and test new instruments and performance measures to improve the accuracy of assessing quality outcomes for both English and Spanish speaking Latinos with cancer; 4) acquire further grant writing skills and experiences, resulting in the submission of an R01 grant before the end of the support period. Properly identifying the end-of-life preferences of cancer patients is a national healthcare priority and understanding the clinical, cultural, psychosocial and system-level factors that influence these decisions is paramount for clinicians and policymakers trying to respect patient preferences and improve their quality of care. The aim of the study is to determine if declining health status influences the end-of-life treatment preferences in Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and how these preferences are modified by factors such as acculturation, health literacy, medical mistrust, provider ethnicity or the use of interpreters, or patient navigators. Participants will be 100 older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, stage III or greater, and 100 contemporaries without cancer. Persons without cancer will be surveyed only once cross-sectionally and those with cancer will be interviewed at baseline and then monthly until twelve months or death to capture the preferences of both those who are undergoing rapid decline and those who are stable. Understanding the relationship between declining functional status and the treatment preferences of older Latinos with cancer has important clinical and policy implications, as findings could influence the use of written documents for advance care planning and inform the content and frequency of discussions that may be needed to capture changes in preferences triggered by changes in health status. We expect the proposed area of study and research that integrates palliative cancer care and health disparities research and applies prospective analytic methods to investigate a critical and understudied area to make a significant contribution to cancer care research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: End-of-Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the older population and new Latino cancer cases are predicted to double within the next twenty years. A person with cancer's choices to forgo life-extending treatment may change over time and as their health declines, yet identifying their choices related to one of life's most difficult periods is not always easy. This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients, influence their end-of-life treatment choices.           End-of-Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the older population and new Latino cancer cases are predicted to double within the next twenty years.

"Community Health Worker Diabetes RCT for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos experience a 50-100% higher burden of illness and mortality due to diabetes than White Americans. Diabetes, if inadequately controlled, produces major social and economic costs for affected families and the larger community. While there is recent evidence of success for diabetes lifestyle interventions, there is a need for new and creative approaches that maintain the intensity of these interventions and at the same time meet the needs of under-resourced racial/ethnic communities. Community health worker (CHW) interventions have shown great promise, particularly among poor communities of color, but there is a need to evaluate these interventions for their effectiveness and potential cost-savings. The overall aim of this community-based randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) is to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of a CHW-led intervention designed to promote diabetes self-management and other healthy behaviors, compared to an enhanced usual- care (EUC) control group, among Latino residents of Detroit with physician-diagnosed type-2 diabetes. We will test the hypothesis that our CHW intervention led by trained Family Health Advocates (FHA) will increase knowledge of diabetes, increase physical activity, healthy dietary practices, improve diabetes self- management, and decrease HbA1c among Latino participants with diabetes. We propose to randomly assign 260 participants to either the FHA or EUC group. Participants assigned to the EUC group will receive invitations to community activities that are free and open to the public, including a general diabetes education class, physical activity classes, and healthy eating activities. The FHA group also will receive these invitations and the additional services of FHAs, who assist participants through a four-step, empowerment behavior change model and five-session diabetes education curriculum. FHAs also provide support services, including one-on-one education, accompanying clients on clinic visits, and linking clients to needed health care and other resources. Additionally, we hypothesize that the FHA group participants will have improved levels of patient activation compared to the EUC control group, as measured by health service utilization, completion of recommended tests, self-efficacy, and patient-provider communication. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of community health worker services that contribute to achievement of behavioral and clinical outcomes versus the EUC control group is hypothesized. This intervention will be implemented in collaboration with REACH Detroit, an existing partnership between university and community organizations which aims to reduce racial and ethnic disparities by preventing diabetes and its complications. The REACH Detroit and its collaborators have a successful record of community-based participatory intervention research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research aims to demonstrate how a culturally tailored community health worker intervention can be a cost-effective method for assisting Latinos with diabetes to improve their self-management skills and health status. If successful, the methods and results of this research will assist communities and health providers and systems to include community health worker services within their systems of care. Ultimately, we believe such interventions hold one key to eliminating disparities in diabetes care and diabetes complications.       ",Community Health Worker Diabetes RCT for

"A Spanish-Language Intervention to Enhance Routine HIV Patient Care Delivery [CAR     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   This application addresses broad Challenge Area (06) Enabling Technologies and specific Challenge Topic, 06-OD(OBSSR)-101, Using New Technologies to Improve Adherence. Latinos are the fastest-growing group with some of the largest health disparities including HIV. Barriers including language are associated with lower antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence seen among Latinos. There are no evidence-based interventions (randomized trials that significantly reduced viral load and HIV transmission risk to sexual partners - 'positive prevention') delivered in Spanish in routine clinical practice. Our computerized counseling tool (CARE+) in a Phase III trial of English-speaking adults increased ART adherence and reduced viral load and condom use errors. We now propose a longitudinal effectiveness (Phase IV) study to evaluate the impact of computerized counseling in audio-narrated Spanish in a busy urban HIV clinic. This 'CARE+ Spanish' application is responsive to 06-OD(OBSSR)-101, for new technologies to improve adherence in clinical practice. Aim 1: Adapt CARE+ Spanish for use during routine clinical visits by Spanish-speaking HIV clinic attendees using an expert panel to shorten content and add Spanish audio dialects; do usability testing (n<8). Aim 2: Establish real-world utility of 'CARE+ Spanish'. Peer staff will recruit Spanish-speaking adults on ART who will be randomly assigned to intervention (Group A n=250) or risk-assessment control (B, n=250) for 0,3-,6-,9- month sessions; at 12-month session groups will switch to opposite arm (delayed intervention design). Linear and generalized linear mixed effects models will analyze impact on 30-day ART adherence, clinic visit adherence, HIV-1 viral load and sexual risks, and to assess whether any Group A changes are sustained at month 12, among an expected n=400 retained study participants (120 female, 280 male). Aim 3: Explore cultural acceptability of tool among clients and clinic providers. Conduct qualitative exit interviews with patients (n=75) to assess technology uptake factors, cultural/linguistic acceptability, and suggestions for ongoing use among older vs. younger, and US-born vs. foreign-born Latino groups. Conduct two focus groups with providers (n<30) to assess perceived technology barriers/facilitators. Analysis will identify factors affecting acceptability, utilization, and impact. Technology tools like CARE+ present significant opportunities to bridge the health promotion delivery gap, especially if linguistically adapted for often-neglected groups such as Latinos (15 percent of the US population). This Spanish-language computerized counseling intervention will deliver evidence-based treatment support to a highly vulnerable Latino population. We will evaluate effectiveness on medication and clinic visit adherence, and biological outcomes (n=500). We will identify cultural factors related to this technology's acceptability and scalability among Spanish-speaking HIV patients, and providers.               PROJECT NARRATIVE This Spanish-language computerized counseling intervention will deliver evidence-based treatment support to a highly vulnerable Latino population.

"Engaging Latino Families in Eating Disorders Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Mae Lynn Reyes-Rodriguez, Clinical Assistant Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has a Minority Supplement from the National Institute of Mental Health to adapt a novel couple- based intervention for adults with anorexia nervosa for Latinos [UCAN: Uniting Couples (in the treatment of) Anorexia Nervosa]. Career goals: To become an independent investigator in the field of eating disorders specializing in working with the Latino population. Career Development: This award will enable Dr. Reyes- Rodriguez to continue her development as a patient-oriented researcher. The candidate plans to: 1) gain new competencies in health disparities, design and conduct of clinical trials, statistical analysis of clinical trial data, and theories of community-based intervention; 2) gain further training and experience in the responsible conduct of research relevant for a clinical trials investigator, cultural diversity, family-based intervention models, Latino mental health, and integrating biomarker studies into clinical trials; and 3) develop the necessary research skills, preliminary data, grant writing skills and record of scholarly productivity to become competitive for independent NIH funding. Mentorship: These goals will be achieved through: 1) the mentorship of Drs. Cynthia Bulik (eating disorders). Marci Campbell (health disparities), Donald Baucom (clinical trials) and Kimberly Brownley (biomarkers); 2) consultation with Drs. Robert Hamer (statistical methods), and Drs. Margarita Alegria, Concepcion Barrio, Anne Becker and Debra Franko (Latino health and cultural adaptation); 3) coursework, workshops, and other structured didactic activities; and the execution of the proposed research project. Research Study: Research on culturally sensitive assessment and treatment of eating disorders among Latinos is scarce. Providing culturally sensitive treatments for Latinos with psychiatric disorders is essential to reverse public health disparities. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to gather comprehensive qualitative information about the appropriate role for family members in the treatment of eating disorders in Latino adults; 2) to develop and manualize an adjunctive family intervention to augment Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for eating disorders for Latino adults; 3) to pre-test the family intervention adjunctive intervention; and 4) to compare individual CBT + FE versus individual CBT in a proof-of-principle study. Environment: This study will take place at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the collaboration of Latino community centers in Chapel Hill. Relevance: The proposed series of investigations will yield a culturally sensitive evidence-based treatment model for Latinos with eating disorders ready for testing in a larger multi-site clinical trial as well as for adaptation for community delivery. The use of a community-based approach will enable a practical treatment model in order to enhance engagement and retention in treatment in the Latino population while delivering high quality mental health intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the need for further research on the assessment and treatment of eating disorders within the Latino population, as well as culturally appropriate treatment of eating disorders, this project intends to contribute to our knowledge and to provide culturally sensitive treatments of eating disorders in Latinos. Appropriate treatment will be important tools for use in future evidence-based treatment studies.              Project Narrative Given the need for further research on the assessment and treatment of eating disorders within the Latino population, as well as culturally appropriate treatment of eating disorders, this project intends to contribute to our knowledge and to provide culturally sensitive treatments of eating disorders in Latinos.

"UPR-CHA Research Center of Excellence:  Making a Difference for Latino Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses NCMHD Competitive Revision Application (NOT-MD-10-002). It provides the opportunity to fill the knowledge gap of Comparative Effectiveness Research (CER) for mental health care for Latinos by comparing two public health approaches. One is offered by telephone and one face-to face, consisting of a brief evidence-based depression treatment (6 to 8 sessions), with care coordination, aggressive outreach and systematic monitoring and supervision. The proposed application is made by the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) in collaboration with Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA) through its Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research (CMMHR). It seeks to expand the Comprehensive Research Center of Excellence (UPR-CHA RCE) to: 1) conduct CER focusing on evidence based depression care given ""outside the clinic walls"" for Latinos; (2) incorporate training of junior investigators on comparative effectiveness into   current P60 activities; (3) establish CER data infrastructure in two large public health systems; and 4)   develop tools (i.e. manuals) and methods (training materials like DVDs) to disseminate CER findings and methodologies. The ongoing UPR-CHA RCE focuses on the multiple and complex factors contributing to health disparities among mainland and island Latino populations. Depression is a highly prevalent, chronic condition among ethnic and racial minorities with significant consequences for health care costs. There are enduring disparities in depression treatment for Latinos, as evidenced by problems In access, engagement and retention. Latinos with depression are less likely to access specialty mental health services than non- Latino whites and for those that do access care, early dropout and high rates of missed follow-up appointments persist. Our proposed research design responds to depression disparities in entry, engagement and retention into depression treatment for Latinos. We propose a two site randomized control trial to test the comparative effectiveness of a combined care manager and brief Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) intervention called Engagement and Counseling for Latinos, administered by telephone (ECLA-T), compared against the same intervention administered face to face (ECLA-F), and mental health treatment in usual primary care for 300 Latino depressed patients attending primary care clinics.

"Community Health Worker Diabetes RCT for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos experience a 50-100% higher burden of illness and mortality due to diabetes than White Americans. Diabetes, if inadequately controlled, produces major social and economic costs for affected families and the larger community. While there is recent evidence of success for diabetes lifestyle interventions, there is a need for new and creative approaches that maintain the intensity of these interventions and at the same time meet the needs of under-resourced racial/ethnic communities. Community health worker (CHW) interventions have shown great promise, particularly among poor communities of color, but there is a need to evaluate these interventions for their effectiveness and potential cost-savings. The overall aim of this community-based randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) is to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of a CHW-led intervention designed to promote diabetes self-management and other healthy behaviors, compared to an enhanced usual- care (EUC) control group, among Latino residents of Detroit with physician-diagnosed type-2 diabetes. We will test the hypothesis that our CHW intervention led by trained Family Health Advocates (FHA) will increase knowledge of diabetes, increase physical activity, healthy dietary practices, improve diabetes self- management, and decrease HbA1c among Latino participants with diabetes. We propose to randomly assign 260 participants to either the FHA or EUC group. Participants assigned to the EUC group will receive invitations to community activities that are free and open to the public, including a general diabetes education class, physical activity classes, and healthy eating activities. The FHA group also will receive these invitations and the additional services of FHAs, who assist participants through a four-step, empowerment behavior change model and five-session diabetes education curriculum. FHAs also provide support services, including one-on-one education, accompanying clients on clinic visits, and linking clients to needed health care and other resources. Additionally, we hypothesize that the FHA group participants will have improved levels of patient activation compared to the EUC control group, as measured by health service utilization, completion of recommended tests, self-efficacy, and patient-provider communication. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of community health worker services that contribute to achievement of behavioral and clinical outcomes versus the EUC control group is hypothesized.

We propose to randomly assign 260 participants to either the FHA or EUC group. Participants assigned to the EUC group will receive invitations to community activities that are free and open to the public, including a general diabetes education class, physical activity classes, and healthy eating activities. The FHA group also will receive these invitations and the additional services of FHAs, who assist participants through a four-step, empowerment behavior change model and five-session diabetes education curriculum. FHAs also provide support services, including one-on-one education, accompanying clients on clinic visits, and linking clients to needed health care and other resources. Additionally, we hypothesize that the FHA group participants will have improved levels of patient activation compared to the EUC control group, as measured by health service utilization, completion of recommended tests, self-efficacy, and patient-provider communication. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of community health worker services that contribute to achievement of behavioral and clinical outcomes versus the EUC control group is hypothesized. This intervention will be implemented in collaboration with REACH Detroit, an existing partnership between university and community organizations which aims to reduce racial and ethnic disparities by preventing diabetes and its complications. The REACH Detroit and its collaborators have a successful record of community-based participatory intervention research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research aims to demonstrate how a culturally tailored community health worker intervention can be a cost-effective method for assisting Latinos with diabetes to improve their self-management skills and health status. If successful, the methods and results of this research will assist communities and health providers and systems to include community health worker services within their systems of care. Ultimately, we believe such interventions hold one key to eliminating disparities in diabetes care and diabetes complications.       ",Community Health Worker Diabetes RCT for

"Improving Latino Health Literacy: An Intergenerational Approach    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this FAST TRACK SBIR is to develop and evaluate a culturally relevant health literacy- training program for Latinos to improve the knowledge and skills to protect health and prevent disease. This program is tentatively entitled Entre Nuestra Familias/Among Our Latino Families (ENF). Drawing from traditional Hispanic values, the ENF Program provides an intergenerational approach to health education, offering multiple members of the family simultaneous training in key health literacy skills and information on cross-cutting health topics to reinforce healthy behaviors within families and communities. This training program will be offered through community-based organizations to reduce institutional barriers to care that are often experienced by Latinos.  The U.S. Census reported in 2007 that there are45.5 million Hispanics living in the U.S. Not only do Latinos constitute the fastest growing minority group in the country, but they also face significant health challenges. Indeed, Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and there is evidence that the health disparities experienced by Latinos may be linked to significant barriers to health care, including low rates of health insurance, low English proficiency, lack of accurate and culturally relevant health information, a dearth of culturally competent health facilities and information, fear and mistrust of the U.S. Medical system. Because of these disparities and their resulting impact on health, there have been strong calls to develop culturally appropriate public health initiatives to improve the health of Latinos in the U.S. To that end, KDH Research & Communication will develop the ENF Program.  In Phase I, KDHRC will develop the print portions of the training program, and conduct a pilot evaluation of the product's effectiveness, in collaboration with Dia de la Mujer Latino, a health advocacy group that serves Latinos. In Phase II, we will expand the training program to include video elements for the participants and multimedia aspects for the facilitator. Then, we will implement and evaluate the training program at multiple sites to examine the program's effectiveness and the extent to which different social factors (poverty, education, country of origin, geographic location) best predict efficacy of the program, using a quasi- experimental pre-test, post-test evaluation design.  Following product completion and evaluation, the ENF program will be disseminated to community-based organizations nationwide. The results of the evaluation will be disseminated through the academic literature and practice and policy briefs to add to scientific knowledge about best practices for reducing health disparities in Latino communities. Further, we will conduct town hall meetings in our target communities to disseminate results of the evaluation to those most affected by the research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and as a result, there have been strong calls for the public health community to develop culturally appropriate interventions to reduce health disparities. This proposal is to develop an intergenerational health literacy training program that incorporates key aspects of Latino culture to engage and retain participants. The program will be delivered through community based nonprofit and faith-based organizations to reduce barriers to care. After the development and evaluation of this product, the training program will be disseminated nationwide to provide the public health field with an effective and innovative tool to reduce health disparities among Latinos.                PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and as a result, there have been strong calls for the public health community to develop culturally appropriate interventions to reduce health disparities.

"UPR-CHA Research Center of Excellence: Making a Difference for Latino Health Health and health service disparities are pervasive in asthma and mental disorders in both Puerto Rico and the United States among Latinos. The causes for these disparities are poorly understood and effective interventions to eliminate these disparities are needed. The mission of the proposed University of Puerto Rico-Cambridge Health Alliance Research Center of Excellence (UPR-CHA RCE) is to conduct research on Latino health and health care disparities, specifically mental disorders, substance abuse and asthma, and to generate and test models of improved service delivery to eliminate these disparities. The UPR-CHA RCE will build on the strengths and experiences of the UPR-CHA EXPORT Center. The UPR-CHA RCE is led by an experienced and diverse research team with a long history of collaboration and commitment to the study of service disparities among minority populations. The Center is structured around a Research, Administrative and Training Core. Based on a conceptual model developed by the group, three research projects will test multi-level interventions at the provider, individual/family and policy level to reduce health services disparities in mental disorders and pediatric asthma (Projects 1 and 2) and provide data to understand the magnitude of substance abuse treatment disparities and the social and economic burden of these disparities (Project 3). Two pilot projects open up new areas of research on disparities, one focusing on a low-cost prevention intervention for mothers of asthmatic children at risk for depression (Pilot 1) and another on documenting disparities in the treatment of mentally ill nursing home residents (Pilot 2).   The five aims of the proposed UPR-CHA-RCE are to: 1) Establish an administrative structure that integrates and centralizes a synergistic core of researchers into a single interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary enterprise by pulling together resources, leadership, and expertise from the mainland US and Puerto Rico. 2) Continue to establish, strengthen and maintain partnerships with organizations and communities for conducting original and relevant research leading to improvement in Latino health and in eliminating service disparities. 3) Enhance research and training activities of the ongoing UPR-CHA EXPORT Center to mentor and develop Latino investigators and to increase the number of minority researchers who conduct health disparities research. 4) Formulate and conduct an interdisciplinary asthma and mental health services and intervention research program to increase our understanding of and eliminate and/or reduce service disparities of Latinos in all stages of their life cycle. 5) Disseminate and integrate the product of these efforts to inform policy decisions, clinical practice and community partners, and orient health service systems to provide culturally and linguistically appropriate services.

"Implementing the Health for All Model with Latino Community of Kansas City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to longstanding health disparities in multiple minority populations, there is a deep need for innovative strategies and models that change community conditions and promote health equity. The aim of this proposal is to implement the culturally and contextually-adapted Health for All model, a promising pilot-tested intervention to change community conditions to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes risk factors in the Latino community in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas. Using community-based participatory research methods, the project will assure that community members are equal and essential partners in developing, implementing and evaluating interventions focused on reducing health disparities. This project builds on the long-term relationship between the KU Work Group for Community Health and Development, at the University of Kansas, and the Kansas City - Chronic Disease Coalition. The community intervention will be comprised of several key components and elements, including: the creation of a clear vision and mission, logic model, and action plan adapted for the local Latino community; the assurance of intensive supports for the plan's implementation; the hiring of community mobilizers; documentation and review of activities for feedback and improvement; and shared responsibility among scientific and community partners for the project's development, implementation, and evaluation. Community-determined long-term objectives focus on related risk behaviors (e.g., increasing daily fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity levels, cholesterol screen levels, and decreasing obesity). This will be achieved through the implementation of an action plan that puts in place new programs, policies and practices at the community and system levels that affect risk for CVD and diabetes in the Latino community and among organizations that serve Latinos.

"Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos have been consistently found to underutilize formal mental health services and are less likely to receive quality care for mental and behavioral disorders compared to other racial/ethnic groups. Efficacious treatments for mental disorders are available, but dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions for Latinos is limited. An annual LBHI Conference for five years is proposed to improve the exchange of scientific findings and enhance collaboration among 1000 attendees annually representing researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, consumers and their families. The conference sessions will provide findings on evidence-based interventions across the life span, and sessions that address the contextual issues (e.g., culturally and linguistically relevant program approaches, community characteristics, system-level barriers and interventions), and process issues (e.g. engagement strategies) that are critical to addressing the disparities in service access and utilization. The Conferences are a collaborative effort between LBHI and national, state, county and community partners to provide a forum for the exchange of information on the distinctive mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, and resilience issues of Latinos. They are also designed to provide a forum for developing strategic partnerships and community participation to support research capacity relevant to Latino mental health. The Conferences support, as attendees, investigators at the pre-doctoral, post-doctoral, and early investigator levels to stimulate their interest in Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the Latino organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. LBHI will convene a national strategic planning process to identify the: 1) information needs of target attendees regarding evidence-based interventions in Latino service settings and 2) effective dissemination and implementation mechanisms to address conference objectives. Barriers to effective dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions into Latino service settings will be addressed by the Conferences through the following objectives. The annual Conference will: (1) result in enhanced capacity of researchers, mental health care providers, policy makers, advocates, and consumers and their families to collaborate in the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based interventions in service settings for Latinos; (2) increase the capacity to conduct research in Latino mental health service settings through the formation of strategic partnerships, community engagement and the submission of NIH grant applications; and, (3) increase investigator knowledge and interest in addressing Latino mental and behavioral disorders, recovery, resilience and the organizational and community processes relevant to dissemination and implementation. The Latino Behavioral Health Institute (LBHI) proposes a series of five annual conferences designed to enhance behavioral health services to the Latino community, the fastest growing, and yet in terms of mental health services, the most underserved population in the United States. The purpose of the annual conferences is to facilitate the exchange of scientific information and clinical experience among the over 1000 attendees including researchers, clinicians, policy makers, consumers and their families. By improving the link between research and clinical practice, the LBHI conferences aim to provide participants with the knowledge and skills to decrease the disparities in mental health service utilization among Latinos and improve the overall health and mental health of the largest minority group in the United States.          ",Latino Behavioral Health Institute Annual Conference,8128451,R13MH078724,"['Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Advocate ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Communities ', ' Participant ', ' Collaborations ', ' Series ', ' Clinical ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Link ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Services ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Institutes ', ' Family ', ' experience ', ' Knowledge ', ' Research ', ' Recovery ', ' Characteristics ', ' United States ', ' improved ', ' interest ', ' skills ', ' Address ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Ethnic group ', ' resilience ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' County ', ' Research Support ', ' Mental disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Latino ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' behavioral health ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Process ', ' clinical practice ', ' Community Participation ', ' Behavior Disorders ', ' behavioral disorder ', ' ']",NIMH,LATINO BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INSTITUTE,R13,2011,23672,0.04588180892476277
"Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will test the causal effects of social capital on levels and inequalities of children's social and cognitive development during the early elementary years. Social capital here refers to trust and shared expectations embedded in social networks of parents, teachers, and children. For young children, social capital operates primarily through their relationships with their parents, enhancing development through mechanisms of social support and social control. Children from low-income Latino families are a special focus of the study. The research design is experimental: social capital will be manipulated through a well-tested intervention Families and Schools Together (FAST) that will enhance the social capital among parents, teachers, and children through an intensive after-school program and a 2-year follow-up program. The study will include 52 schools in Milwaukee and San Antonio (about 208 teachers and 3,120 first graders and their families), with half the schools randomly selected for the intervention and half serving as controls. The experimental design will permit a strong test of the causal role of social capital. The project will also involve an implementation study intended to illuminate the processes by which social capital is generated and affects child development. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, drawing on sociology, psychology, and economics,and it reflects an ecological perspective that crosses boundaries between families and schools. The study thus responds to the call for research on the Science and Ecology of Early Development. Key aspects of child development will be assessed, including (a) social skills and problem behavior from standardized behavioral ratings by parents; (b) the latter plus academic competence as rated by teachers; and (c) grade retention, attendance rates, and third-grade reading and mathematics scores from school records. Social capital will be measured with repeated surveys of teachers and parents that address the extent of social networks, parent involvement, trust, and shared expectations among parents, between parents and schools, and between parents and children. Data will be analyzed with multilevel statistical models that take account of variation at the individual and school levels of analysis.RELEVANCE. Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, and among the most disadvantaged. Latino families often perceive a sense of distance from the school system, which can create barriers to their children's academic and social development, important dimensions of public health. This study will yield practical as well as scientific insights into the value of increased social capital for development of children among a variety of demographic groups, and particularly those from low-income Latino families.          ",Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study,8127702,R01HD051762,"['girls ', ' Psychology ', ' Mathematics ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Trust ', ' third grade ', ' Social Network ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Accounting ', ' Goals ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Social Problems ', ' social disturbance ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Economics ', ' programs ', ' Schools ', ' Affect ', ' Cognitive ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' insight ', ' experience ', ' Individual ', ' Reading ', ' Behavioral ', ' Research ', ' Outcome ', ' Testing ', ' member ', ' Population ', ' Measures ', ' Parents ', ' Process ', ' Performance ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Address ', ' boys ', ' Competence ', ' Target Populations ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Records ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' teacher ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' intervention program ', ' Dimensions ', ' Control Groups ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' randomized trial ', ' Country ', ' Latino ', ' expectation ', ' Students ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Low income ', ' social ', ' intervention effect ', ' evidence base ', ' Family ', ' Data ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Modeling ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Science ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Interview ', ' Inequality ', ' Social Controls ', ' Social Development ', ' after-school program ', ' social capital ', ' first grade ', ' Absenteeism ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sociology ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2011,738605,0.06808873208394509
"A Church-Based, Self-Management Intervention for Mexican-Americans with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term research objective is to become a nationally respected, independent community-based researcher, with a specific focus on using faith-based interventions to reduce diabetes disparities among Latinos. Diabetes is a very prevalent and morbid condition affecting Latinos, especially Mexican-Americans in the United States. Many church-based interventions have shown promise improving health outcomes among minority populations; but data on church-based interventions for Latino populations is scarce. Considering that the church is a center of Latino family and culture, interventions based in churches has promise to have great impact on this population.

"Health Communication & Health Literacy to Improve Care for Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes disparities are common for Latino patients. Effective health communication can potentially narrow these disparities. This proposal details a career development plan that will prepare the principal investigator (PI) for success as an independent investigator with expertise in diabetes-related outcomes, health communication, and delivery of behavioral interventions for Latino diabetes patients. As an Internal Medicine- Pediatrics physician, with training in clinical investigation, the PI will gain new skills through this K23 in the areas of health disparities specific to diabetes care, enhanced Latino cultural competency, audio taping clinical encounters to assess the quality and role of health communication, and the development of a new training program for medical interpreters. The PI's immediate goals are to rigorously examine the quality of health communication between Latino diabetes patients, providers, and Spanish interpreters and the association between health communication and various diabetes-related health outcomes. To meet this goal, the PI has proposed a rigorous career development plan that incorporates additional didactic course work, regular participation in local and national meetings/seminars, a mentored research experience, and active involvement in an extremely supportive research environment. This includes an NIDDK funded Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC), NCRR-funded Meharry Clinical and Translational Research Center (MeTRC), Vanderbilt Program on Effective Health Communication (EHC), and an RCMI-funded Bioinformatics Core. The research specific aims are to: 1) conduct a cross-sectional, descriptive mixed-methods analysis of the quality of health communication between providers and Latino diabetes patients with particular emphasis on the role of the Spanish medical interpreter during language discordant encounters, and explore the association between baseline quality of health communication and various diabetes related health outcomes, 2) conduct an observational cohort study to examine the independent effect of provider health communication training and the use of a Spanish, literacy-sensitive educational toolkit on the quality of health communication during medical encounters, and assess the association between changes in the quality of health communication at 12 months with changes in diabetes related health outcomes, and 3) develop and pilot in a small RCT, an enhanced training program for Spanish medical interpreters geared toward improving their ability to work with providers and patients with LEP and limited health literacy during language discordant encounters. Overall, this K23 program will provide important insights into the nature of health communication with Latinos, the role of Spanish interpreters in this process, and most importantly prepare the PI for independent investigation of the role of effective health communication in addressing disparities in care for Latinos with diabetes.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Effective health communication can potentially improve diabetes care and clinical outcomes for Latino patients.

"Kansas Community Cancer Health Disparities Network DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indian and Latino populations suffer from significant cancer disparities. Rural Al and Latino communities, in geographically large states, such as Kansas, experience even greater access to cancer screening and treatment disadvantage due to dispersion of specialists and facilities. The Kansas Community Cancer Disparities Network (KCCDN) headquartered at the University of Kansas Medical Center will concentrate on reaching rural Al and Latinos with innovative programs to improve knowledge, access and utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral cancer procedures. Using community based participatory research methods (CBPR) and linking our primary care research network (the Kansas Physicians Engaged in Prevention Research, KPEPR) to our newly formed Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) hospital network, we will improve outreach, research, and training on cancer disparities in two rural counties; Finney County (SW Kansas; Latino) and Brown County (NE Kansas; Al). Our CNP Network will capitalize on thriving research programs offered in our AHECS, Telemedicine Center and safety-net clinic system (Kansas Association for the Medically Underserved, KAMU), and it will leverage strong and trusting relationships we have built while providing service and collecting needs assessment data in both the regional Al and Latino communities. Effective, standing community advisory boards (CABs) in each community were consulted directly during the design and planning of this proposal and we have structured a CNP Network governance that assures community interests come first. Our Outreach Core activities will build on the strengths available within the MCA, KPEPR, and the Telemedicine Office and allow for expanded and improved education through promotores, IT resources, and theory-driven strategic communications and a social marketing campaign. With direct input from rural partners we will conduct a rigorous and controlled clinical trial, testing the efficacy of a novel intervention based on the ""implementation intentions"" construct to promote breast cancer screening in Latina and Al women (PI, Engelman). Our Pilot Educational Project will utilize promotores and ties to the MCA network to enhance knowledge, awareness and interest in cancer clinical trials among targeted Al and Latino communities (PI, Cupertino). Our Training Core program will rest on a strong foundation formed by our K30 clinical research curriculum program and an interdisciplinary T-32 fellowship program (PI, Greiner) specifically designed to train health disparities researchers through community-based research activities. Our KCCDN will succeed in reducing cancer disparities for Kansas' rural Latinos and American Indians because it creates a vision for seamless blending access to care enhancements, culturally tailored educational outreach, rigorous research, and junior investigator CBPR training. Using the building blocks already in place, our model program will reach vulnerable minorities and generate disseminable knowledge for the national CNP consortium.

"Differential Delivery of Follow-up Care and Survivorship Among Latinos Using Medi DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Differential Delivery of Follow-up Care and Survivorship Among Latinos Using Medicare This application addresses broad Challenge Area (05) Comparative Effectiveness Research and specific Challenge Topic, 05-AA-101 Innovative Analyses of Existing Clinical Datasets. Research shows equal access to cancer treatment and supportive care eliminates disparities in outcomes. Latinos comprise 45.5 million people in the US. Although many reports demonstrate Latinos, compared to non-Hispanics, have lower risks of some diseases and death and even have better health behaviors despite having traditional risk factors associated with poor health such as low income and education levels. Paradoxally, Latinos with some cancers are more likely to die sooner than non-Latinos. For example, a Latina woman diagnosed with breast cancer is 22% more likely to die of breast cancer during the 5 years after diagnosis than a non- Latina white woman of the same age with the same stage of disease. This phenomena needs urgent investigation. The reasons for poorer survival in the Latino community are unclear but may reflect poorer access to timely, high quality treatment. Scientists have not studied if the timeliness of cancer and preventative care that Latinos with breast, prostate and stomach cancers receive impacts their survivorship. This study will focus on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer surveillance data linkage to Medicare. First, this study will assess how soon after a diagnosis Latinos receive standard care for breast, prostate and stomach cancers compared to other ethnic groups. Then this study will determine if delays in either cancer care or general preventative health care depends on where Latinos live (i.e. neighborhoods that are poor, without many doctors or where most residents speak only Spanish). Finally, this study will assess if the delays in treatment and care are associated with earlier death in Latinos compared to other ethnic groups. By the end of the 2-year study period, this study will have trained graduate students in health services research providing infrastructure to address the most challenging questions in health care delivery. Society will know barriers that stand in the way of timely and high-quality care for Latino cancer survivors. This research will assist policy makers, the research community and the health care system apply current knowledge about successful treatments equally throughout the population and ultimately reduce disparities between ethnic and racial groups and develop effective targeted interventions and policies to avoid one-size-fits-all policies that perpetuate disparities in cancer survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide knowledge about the differential delivery of follow-up care and its impact on survivorship in the Latino population. Policy makers, the research community, and health providers will use this knowledge to provide evidence based delivery of care equally throughout the population.

"A Partnership Approach to Reducing HIV Disparities Among Latino Men    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern United States has the fastest growing Latino population in the country and carries a disproportionate HIV/AIDS disease burden. We propose a 5-year study (R24) to fully implement and rigorously evaluate a piloted lay health advisor (LHA) intervention designed to reduce risk of HIV infection among recently arrived, monolingual, less-acculturated Latino men who are settling in the Southeast. The intervention is based on social cognitive theory and the theory of empowerment education and was developed using community-based participatory research (CBPR). This study is a result of a long-term community-university partnership that has used and will continue to use CBPR throughout all phases of the research process.      A total of 20 Latino soccer teams in rural NC will be randomized to an LHA-led HIV prevention intervention or a delayed-intervention comparison group. One man from each of the intervention teams (n=10) will be nominated by his teammates and selected as an LHA in Year 2. The delayed-intervention teams (n=10) will receive the same intervention in Year 3. Quantitative assessment data will be collected from each LHA and 12 of his teammates from each of the 20 teams at: (1) baseline, (2) immediate postintervention, and (3) 12-month follow-up.      Participants in the HIV prevention intervention, relative to their peers in the delayed-intervention comparison group, are anticipated to demonstrate (1) increased self-reported use of condoms during sexual intercourse and (2) increased self-reported utilization of HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD) counseling, testing, and treatment services.      To further evaluate and explore the intervention, qualitative data will be collected using individual in-depth interviews with LHAs and their teammates. We also will evaluate the CBPR process, using direct observation of partnership meetings, in-depth interviews with partners, and partnership document review.      Products from this study will include (1) a Spanish-language intervention that is ready for dissemination and adaptation, culturally relevant and gender-specific, and designed to reduce HIV risk among recently arrived, less-acculturated Latino men; (2) a deeper understanding of HIV risk and intervention among Latino men that will be reported through briefs, newspaper articles, local and national presentations, and manuscripts; and (3) insight into a research partnership process that includes lay community members, Latino soccer leagues and teams, AIDS service organizations, community-based organizations, 3 universities, and a broad spectrum of other partners.          ",A Partnership Approach to Reducing HIV Disparities Among Latino Men,8056652,R24MD002774,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', '

"Acculturation and physical activity: Forecasting and improving Latino health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to expand the UCLA Health Forecasting Tool (UCLA HFT) to examine drivers of health and longevity in Latinos in California compared to other ethnic/racial groups, and to elucidate the contribution of acculturation, as defined by time lived in the U.S. and age at immigration to the U.S., on rates of disease and death. The proposed project will analyze causes of disparities and the mitigating effects of physical activity interventions on health outcomes and disparities. This research will facilitate more proactive and effective policy responses to California's changing demographic profile and related changes in population health outcomes, and will serve as a model for other regions of the country where similar demographic shifts are expected. The project will also demonstrate methodology for generating sound, evidence-based estimates of the potential impact of large-scale implementation of health interventions.  Disparities in morbidity and mortality exist between and within racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Overall, Latinos in California exhibit lower mortality rates than non-Latinos, however disaggregation into subgroups based on the age of immigration and number of years in the U.S. permits a more robust understanding of complex disparities in morbidity. Despite better overall health outcomes, as Latinos spend more time in the U.S. they are more likely to be obese and have diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease than most other sub-populations. The rapid increase in the Latino population, expected to become the largest ethnic group in California by 2020, along with a health profile that deteriorates with time spent in the U.S., adds urgency to better understanding how health outcomes may evolve and how programs and policies may be used to improve future health outcomes.  The UCLA HFT, which has been developed over the course of seven years, comprehensively evaluates and forecasts future health outcomes associated with preventable and/or reducible ill-health and injury in California. The UCLA HFT uses micro stimulation to model individuals' health over the entire life span. It incorporates data on demographics, behavioral risk factors and other determinants of health, related disease and health conditions. Most important is its ability to evaluate a broad range of policy alternatives that can improve population health and modify disparities. We propose to expand the UCLA HFT to (1) incorporate information on the migration of Latinos in California, including the length of time they have been in the U.S., (2) estimate future trends in the incidence rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and mortality, (3) examine mortality, disease and risk factor trends in relation to physical inactivity, smoking and obesity for Latinos in California compared to other ethnic/racial groups, (4) analyze the contribution of differential health behaviors on health disparities among Latinos and other groups, and (5) estimate the effects of several evidence-based interventions, designed to increase physical activity, on the health of Latinos and disparities in health.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disparities in health are seen between and within ethnic groups. Notably, Latinos exhibit disparities associated with place of birth and time lived in the United States. We will examine the causes of these disparities through the use of a computer-based simulation model, estimate future changes in the health of Californians that take into account migration patterns, and compare the potential for different interventions that promote physical activity to improve the health of Latinos living in California.           Project Narrative (2-3 sentence layperson summary):  Disparities in health are seen between and within ethnic groups.

"Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) that will focus on reducing cardiovascular disease risk among Latinos in East Los Angeles, California (East L.A.). East L.A. is an urban community with high rates of obesity-related chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke. East L.A. is over 96% Latino; 85% of whom have Mexican ancestry and the rest come mainly from Central America. Our primary objective is to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in this under-served area. To accomplish this objective, we have three integrated, complementary projects, two cores, and a Training and Career Development Program. We will use a community-based participatory approach to implement family and neighborhood environment interventions, along with the collection of physiological data that will examine risk in individuals and across generations. The intervention components include several dimensions that affect health outcomes - personal & family factors, systems factors, and environmental factors. Project 1 is an intensive home environment intervention involving families, of which one member is a high-risk case newly enrolled in a local diabetes care clinic. Project 2 will examine vascular function and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers for individuals varying in generational and immigrant status, to increase the understanding of the basis for the Latino acculturation paradox in CVD risk. Project 3 will conduct make overs of comer stores to enable them to market and provide healthier food options, as well as enable them to serve as a venue for training community members about healthier food options and meal preparation strategies. The center will also capitalize on the inclusion of both promotoras and public health rookies in intervention activities. The public health rookies will be adolescents recruited from a public high school in the community. The two cores provide administrative and research methods resources to the projects, and the Training and Career Development Program will provide resources and infrastructure to provide a pipeline for the public health rookies and will train and mentor graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty on the use of interdisciplinary, disparities-reduction research.          ",Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.,8135574,P50HL105188,[''],NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2011,2613303,0.007238358968120095
"Salud y el Exito: Addressing Proven Factors in HIV Prevention for Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Padres Unidos por la Salud y el ¿xito de Nuestros Hijos aims to support Latino parents and schools in their efforts to promote the healthy choices of children, with the goal of reducing behaviors that lead to elevated levels of HIV/AIDS in urban Latino communities. The study is designed to advance efforts to begin HIV prevention early, during the preteen and young adolescent years, before youth establish patterns of behavior that jeopardize their health and success, or ""Salud y ¿xito."" Salud y ¿xito draws on a solid foundation of theoretical and empirical research that underscores the importance of supporting the primary role that parents play in healthy youth development. The study will test a bilingual version of a multi-year parent-mediated intervention, Salud y ¿xito, with primary Spanish- as well as English-speaking Latino parents and youth. This intervention consists of parent education delivered through sets of audio-CDs to promote positive parenting practices, including monitoring, rule setting, communication, and support. In addition, Salud y ¿xito M s, an enhanced version of this parent-mediated approach, will be tested. This enhanced intervention integrates audio-CD parent education with a school-based parent involvement program, PALMS Tools for Latino Family Outreach. These tools facilitate the creation of welcoming environments that encourage parental involvement in their preteens' and young adolescents' academic success and future education planning. This is critical because Latinos experience the highest levels of school dropout and school failure, which are both consequences and risk factors for risky behaviors related to HIV/AIDS. Both intervention components have a common purpose: Promoting positive parenting practices known to foster resiliency and protect youth from risk. The specific aims are to: (1) Enroll and randomly assign 60 urban schools serving high proportions of Latino families to one of three conditions: (a) Salud y ¿xito multi-year parent education; (b) Salud y ¿xito M s parent education supplemented with PALMS; or a (c) comparison condition (health education print materials); (2) Enroll 1600 Latino families with youth from 6th grade classes in the study and conduct telephone parent surveys and youth classroom surveys at baseline; (3)Implement Salud y ¿xito intervention components at schools assigned to the intervention conditions; (4) Conduct youth surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions are effective in reducing risk behaviors and intentions and promoting school attachment and pro-social activities; (5) Conduct parent surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions promote and sustain positive parenting practices; (6) Examine how parenting practices and youth outcomes vary by individual and family characteristics, including gender as well as acculturation; and (7) Examine whether youth outcomes are explained by parenting practices and identify which parenting practices mediate the relationship between experimental condition and youth outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Salud y el ¿xito aims to support Latino parents and schools in their efforts to promote the academic success and healthy choices of children, with the goal of reducing behaviors that lead to elevated levels of HIV/AIDS in urban Latino communities.

"Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance Abstract  The purpose of the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA) is to ameliorate the lack of highly qualified first-generation-educated Latino graduates prepared to engage in graduate degrees in health disparities research in both biomedical and health science-related disciplines. Latinos have been and continue to be gravely underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social science disciplines. In 2009 Latinos made up fewer than 5% of all medical scientists, despite being 15.8% of the US population, the largest minority group. Although Latinos represent a growing proportion of college admissions, they continue to lag behind in enrollment and degree completion (Becerra 2010). Entry-level science courses (e.g. chemistry, biology) tend to eliminate Latinos students from advancement in science degrees. In response to this critical educational deficit, and with support from the NIMHD Science Education Initiative, the NCLR/CSULB Center for Latino Community Health, Evaluation, and Leadership Training, will develop the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA).  HOLA will provide health disparities research training and tutoring in science to Latino students in their sophomore and junior years, thus widening the pool of minority applicants for advanced degrees. Moreover, HOLA will be open to students across the natural and health sciences reaching out to pre-health majors who otherwise would not be eligible to participate in existing research opportunities.  HOLA will provide 140 Latino undergraduate students and 30 minority graduate students with educational, mentoring, and career development opportunities designed to facilitate careers in health disparities research through the delivery of: 1) targeted undergraduate tutoring in diverse science courses for Latino pre-health and health science students; 2) workshops in health disparities research methods; 3) health disparities seminars highlighting population-specific issues; and, 4) an annual health disparities conference.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance  Project Narrative The purpose of the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA) is to ameliorate the lack of highly qualified first-generation-educated Latino graduates prepared to engage in graduate degrees in health disparities research in both biomedical and health science-related disciplines. HOLA will accomplish these tasks through: 1) the formation of a graduate research fellow first generation-educated Latino mentor cohort; 2) faculty, lecturer, and staff trainings in health disparities research opportunities and recruitment strategies; 3) recruitment of an annual cohort of first generation-educated Latino students in CHHS and CNSM; and, 4) the creation of educational opportunities to engage students and inform the larger Long Beach community regarding health disparities and research efforts to eliminate the inequities that affect diverse underserved populations.           Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance  ",Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance,8260126,R25MD006851,"['lecturer ', ' Medical Education ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' graduate student ', ' Chemistry ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Qualifying ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Academic Training ', ' M.P.H.

"Nuestro Futuro: Applied Science Education to Engage Black and Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is a curriculum based educational opportunity implemented in an after- school enrichment setting in a Boston, MA public middle school. The project builds on the active NIMHD funded research intervention study, Nuestro Futuro Saludable. This academic enrichment program is focused on inquiry-based science education, public outreach and community-based information campaigns to educate students, families, and their communities on health research topics within a health equity framework. The program is designed to (1) cultivate a deeper, contextualized understanding of scientific concepts among students related to health disparities and the social determinants of health in their community; (2) teach students to foster their ability to ""think"" like scientists from various disciplines (eg: epidemiology, sociology, biomedicine) as they study diseases that present disparities in their community (eg: asthma, diabetes, HIV/AIDS); and (3) provide an opportunity for students to use what they have learned about health, science, and disparities to develop and carry-out local advocacy and outreach efforts. The project is designed to increase the scientific literacy of Latino and Black students, as well as student interest in the sciences and enthusiasm for studying the sciences by providing research career awareness opportunities, mentoring and information dissemination to increase the representation of underrepresented minority groups in the sciences.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The US will have a majority-minority population by 2042, thus minority health will soon characterize the nation's health. Blacks and Latinos, health disparity populations that bear an unequal burden of preventable disease and disability, demonstrate poor academic achievement in the sciences. Alleviating health disparities requires similar progress in addressing disparities in K-12 education and, therefore, it is imperative to increase the number of these underrepresented minorities in the sciences, medicine, health, and research in order to increase the knowledge base and inform efforts to reduce and eliminate health disparities.           The US will have a majority-minority population by 2042, thus minority health will soon characterize the nation's health.

"Trial to Examine Text-Based mHealth for Emergency department patients with Diabet    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the Los Angeles county healthcare system, low-income, predominantly Latino patients with diabetes face significant barriers to accessing primary care and the health education they need. The most desperate come to the emergency department (ED) for management of their diabetes, but the overcrowded ED is not equipped to provide this chronic care. As a result, these patients are amongst the sickest in the nation with mortality rates nearly double that of other populations, and HbA1C levels in the ""take action"" range (mean HbA1C=8.8%). Promising interventions have been developed, but have not been widely implemented due to high cost and personnel requirements. . Inspired by the recent successes of mHealth, the TExT-MED intervention (Trial to Examine Text-Based mHealth for Emergency department patients with Diabetes) was designed. Patients will receive daily text messages focused on motivational challenges, contests, diabetes education, and appointment/medications reminders. The initial curriculum content will be created from National Diabetes Education Program materials with special emphasis on knowledge gaps identified in prior studies (e.g. signs of hypoglycemia). A small pilot study will be conducted prior to the RCT evaluate technical success and ensure appropriateness of message frequency and content. The patients in this pilot study will participate in focus groups which will be analyzed using standard qualitative techniques to refine the TExT-MED curriculum. The project will culminate in a randomized controlled trial of 150 patients with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1C e8%) randomized to usual care or TExT-MED. At enrollment, 3 and 6 months, multiple clinical measures will be recorded: HbA1C, diabetes knowledge, self-reported health, weight, medication compliance, physical activity, food choices, quality of life and health care utilization. This innovative, easily adaptable and low-cost solution has potential to improve glycemic control, knowledge and healthy lifestyle choices in a patient population that has been difficult to reach and complicated to treat.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos in the United States are disproportionately affected by diabetes and face numerous barriers to receiving regular and effective healthcare. Nowhere in the country are the effects of this disparity seen more prominently than in Los Angeles county, where almost half the residents are Latino and the prevalence of diabetes is 50% higher than the national average. The TExT-MED (Trial to Examine Text-Based mHealth for Emergency department patients with Diabetes) program is designed as a novel uni-directional text message based system to help primarily Latino patients with diabetes, learn about their disease, manage their diabetes, enact positive lifestyle changes and improve overall health.          Latinos in the United States are disproportionately affected by diabetes and face numerous barriers to receiving regular and effective healthcare.

"Increasing the Pipeline: Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to increase the proportion of Latinos in cancer control research, particularly in the Southwestern U.S., by establishing a Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research (LTPCCR) that will motivate Latino master's-level students and health professionals to complete doctoral programs and careers as cancer control researchers. The LTPCCR is modeled after an evidence-based training model entitled, Minority Training Program in Cancer Control Research (MTPCCR) that targeted a spectrum of ethnic groups in California. Specifically, the LTPCCR will recruit an annual cohort of 20 Latino master's-level students or master's-trained health professionals. An innovation of the LTPCCR is that it targets a single ethnic minority - Latinos/Hispanics who will come from the Southwestern U.S. and Oklahoma. It will provide four interventions along the pipeline from masters-level to doctoral-level training, including: a) a Summer Institute for all participants, b) 9 annual paid summer internships in cancer disparities research (Y2-5), c) 3 annual Doctoral Application Support Awards and d) a Doctoral Student Retreat. Lastly, it will demonstrate an enrollment rate in doctoral programs that exceeds Latino enrollment achieved by the previous MTPCCR. We anticipate a minimum annual Latino enrollment of at least 15% (a 33% increase over that achieved by the MTPCCR). Additional we expect at least 50% of doctoral students reporting cancer control as their research focus and the majority of doctoral students indicating that the Texas program had a strong positive influence on these academic goals. Other benchmarks for success include a significant increase in self-efficacy and in participants' intention to apply to a doctoral program after attending the Summer Institute; and a minimum of 65% of participants rating each session as excellent.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite private and governmental support for programs that encourage Latinos to move through the pipeline from high school to college to research in basic sciences and medicine, there has been little investment in the social and behavioral sciences that send cancer control researchers out into communities to conduct epidemiologic, communication, and behavioral research.

"Family Care of Older Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos age 65 or older have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and more severe complications from the disease, compared to non-Latino Whites. Latino elders' consequent risks for functional impairment and permanent disability raise questions about their family environment and the role caregivers play in helping them to manage the disease. Studying the family environment is important for addressing and eventually eliminating Latinos' health disparities arising from this chronic disease. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to provide mentored research and professional training to prepare me for a career as a federally-funded, independent investigator on health disparities and aging research in the area of family care of older Latinos. My immediate goals are to 1) develop a research program that characterizes the care of older adults within the Mexican-origin family; and 2) develop proficiency in culturally-relevant interventions for Latino elders and their caregivers. I propose to move my research beyond the female caregiver, toward a family level approach to elder care along one specific health dimension, management of type 2 diabetes. The K01 award builds directly on my current work by 1) including the perspectives of caregiving men and diabetic care-receiving elders; and 2) examining the process of family elder care through observation of caregiver-care receiver dyads (CG-CR dyad) in home settings. I propose three phases of research that culminate in developing and evaluating the feasibility of a CG-CR dyad intervention to improve care receiving Latino elders' diabetes outcomes. The training aspect of this award will provide me with in-depth knowledge in: 1) theory development and measurement of family care of Latino elders; 2) observational methods in home settings; and 3) intervention development and evaluation. My long-term objective is to establish a research trajectory based on theoretical and empirical principles that can be applied in real-world settings to improve the health outcomes of community-dwelling Latino elders. The interdisciplinary mentoring team I put together and my affiliations with the UCLA RCMAR and the UCLA School of Public Health provide the infrastructure to support these endeavors.       RELEVANCE: The proposed research focuses on older Latinos, the largest and second fastest aging sub-population in the United States. Many older Latinos have diabetes and suffer severe consequences from the disease, leading to poor health and disability. This research looks at the role of family caregivers in Latino elders' management of diabetes, one step toward finding ways to improve Latino elders' health in this area.           ",Family Care of Older Latinos with Diabetes,8107479,K01AG033122,"['Public Health Schools ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Self Management ', ' Latino ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Los Angeles ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' One-Step dentin bonding system ', ' One Step ', ' Mentors ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' career ', ' Counseling ', ' Categories ', ' theories ', ' Phase ', ' Outcome ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Family Study ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' Family member ', ' Interview ', ' Dimensions ', ' Woman ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population ', ' male ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Award ', ' Data Collection ', ' Work ', ' Belief ', ' Methods ', ' Aging ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' experience ', ' Age ', ' Diet ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' base ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Measurement ', ' Emotional ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Environment ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Data ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Caring ', ' Pattern ', ' Communities ', ' Location ', ' Modeling ', ' Communication ', ' Female ', ' Knowledge ', ' Preparation ', ' Risk ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' expectation ', ' Play ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Funding ', ' Area ', ' Time ', ' social ', ' United States ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Behavior ', ' programs ', ' Gender ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' cost ', ' Research ', ' Health ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Process ', ' improved ', ' diabetic ', ' Goals ', ' Address ', ' Evaluation ', ' Family ', ' Testing ', ' Perception ', ' Patterns of Care ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' glucose monitor ', ' glucose meter ', ' diabetes management ', ' diabetic management ', ' urban area ', ' Love ', ' Household Heads ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Typology ', ' Mexico ', ' Mexican ', ' Family Process ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Housekeeping ', ' Housework ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,K01,2011,24841,0.09090717886075113
"Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The dramatic increase in the population of Latinos-the largest minority group in the U.S.-over the last decade and challenges Latinos face in terms of accessing health care in the U.S. make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors and issues that affect Latino health disparities in the U.S. Our long term goal is to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventually elimination of Latino health disparities, especially those in HIV/AIDS and substance abuse. The objectives of the proposed P20 Center of Excellence-NCMHD Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the U.S. -are: (1) Conducting original research exploring the role of behavioral and social factors contributing to or influencing minority health and health disparities; (2) Translating research findings into effective interventions for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (3) Conducting original research exploring the efficacy of a full range of health promotion and information dissemination approaches for improving minority health or eliminating health disparities; (4) Establishing innovative partnerships between academic institutions and community groups/organizations; and (5) to increase the number of researchers and professionals who are committed to eliminating health disparities, especially those from minority and medically under-served populations. The proposed Center will expand the activities of two R24 Centers of Excellence in Florida International University (FIU), the largest four-year Hispanic Serving Institution in the U.S. It will build on an existing collaboration between FIU and two community-based organizations: SPECTRUM, the oldest and largest non-profit substance abuse treatment agency in South Florida, and Miami Behavioral Health Center, the largest provider of behavioral healthcare services to Latinos in Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: administrative, research, research education/ training, and community engagement/outreach. Its study population will be the Latino population in Miami-Dade County, the only county in the U.S. with an immigrant majority, 97 percent of which are Latinos. The contributions of the Center are significant, since the Center will fill in the need to conduct research that bridges HIV/AIDS and substance use, enhance trust between the researchers and the community, and produce a cadre of scientists conducting research on health disparities-especially those from Latino and other minority and medically under-served populations. Relevance to Public Health: The Center is expected to lead to development and refinement of culturally relevant and evidence-based HIV prevention strategies available to HIV-uninfected/ infected individuals and users of substances among the Latinos, who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS and substance abuse epidemics in the U.S.          ",Center for Substance Use and AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States,8099057,P20MD002288,[''],NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,P20,2011,1966863,0.022119022647667984
"End-of-life treatment preferences of Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End of Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Principal Investigator: Isabel Torres, Dr.P.H. The overall goal of the NCI K01 career development plan is to provide the candidate with a program of mentored research activity and study in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and outcomes research to launch an independent research career with specialization in the integration of these research areas. The five-year plan is carefully designed to 1) obtain further research experience in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and health services research; 2) advance skills related to the design and analyses of prospective palliative care studies through training in advanced statistical methods; 3) improve skills needed to develop and test new instruments and performance measures to improve the accuracy of assessing quality outcomes for both English and Spanish speaking Latinos with cancer; 4) acquire further grant writing skills and experiences, resulting in the submission of an R01 grant before the end of the support period. Properly identifying the end-of-life preferences of cancer patients is a national healthcare priority and understanding the clinical, cultural, psychosocial and system-level factors that influence these decisions is paramount for clinicians and policymakers trying to respect patient preferences and improve their quality of care. The aim of the study is to determine if declining health status influences the end-of-life treatment preferences in Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and how these preferences are modified by factors such as acculturation, health literacy, medical mistrust, provider ethnicity or the use of interpreters, or patient navigators. Participants will be 100 older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, stage III or greater, and 100 contemporaries without cancer. Persons without cancer will be surveyed only once cross-sectionally and those with cancer will be interviewed at baseline and then monthly until twelve months or death to capture the preferences of both those who are undergoing rapid decline and those who are stable. Understanding the relationship between declining functional status and the treatment preferences of older Latinos with cancer has important clinical and policy implications, as findings could influence the use of written documents for advance care planning and inform the content and frequency of discussions that may be needed to capture changes in preferences triggered by changes in health status. We expect the proposed area of study and research that integrates palliative cancer care and health disparities research and applies prospective analytic methods to investigate a critical and understudied area to make a significant contribution to cancer care research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: End-of-Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the older population and new Latino cancer cases are predicted to double within the next twenty years. A person with cancer's choices to forgo life-extending treatment may change over time and as their health declines, yet identifying their choices related to one of life's most difficult periods is not always easy. This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients, influence their end-of-life treatment choices.           End-of-Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the older population and new Latino cancer cases are predicted to double within the next twenty years.

"San Diego Partnership to Reduce Diabetes and CVD in Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The San Diego Latino Research Center of Excellence is a tri-lateral collaboration that seeks to promote and expedite research that improves cardiovascular disease outcomes in low-income Latinos living in the border region of San Diego. San Diego State University (SDSU) and the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) represent two large research intensive universities, one with a school of public health and the other with a school of medicine, but both with experience and interest in community based research and training. The San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC) is a large, predominantly Latino-serving community health center that provides services to disadvantaged patients. Together, these organizations will build on existing relationships to conduct epidemiologic, behavioral, and genetic research in an effort to improve the care being delivered to indigent Latinos at risk for and having CVD. Investigators and staff at these three institutions will be referred to as the San Diego Partnership Staff. The San Diego Latino Research Center of Excellence proposes to focus on the disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its associated risk factors experienced by low-income Latinos living in the San Diego border region. The center will conduct rigorous community-based research that will primarily lead to reduction in disparities for disadvantaged populations, and at the same time provide improved service to the community, answer important biomedical questions, build research capacity in the community, and stimulate and train investigators in CVD disparities. The goals of the San Diego Latino Center of Excellence are: Goal 1: Conduct research that will reduce CVD disparities in a predominantly Latino community through culturally and linguistically appropriate applications of the ADA and NCEP guidelines Goal 2: Strengthen the infrastructure for minority health and health disparities research and training at SDSU, UCSD, and SYHC Goal 3: Increase the number of minority investigators engaged in cardiovascular disparities research Goal 4: Strengthen the research infrastructure at a community site, SYHC, thereby increasing the potential for university-community partnerships in which research is conducted.          ",San Diego Partnership to Reduce Diabetes and CVD in Latinos,8077441,P20MD002293,[''],NIMHD,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,P20,2011,2729536,0.03267431653586671
"Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Studies in the U.S. and elsewhere have generally shown that higher social position is strongly associated with lower mortality risks and better health at all levels of the socioeconomic ladder. However, the situation for the Latino population is more complex. Despite the poorer socioeconomic status of Latinos, their infant and adult mortality rates are generally the same as or lower than those for whites, a pattern often referred to as the ""Hispanic Paradox."" A second puzzle pertains to findings in the literature that, despite this mortality advantage, Latino survey respondents are more likely than those in other ethnic groups to rate their overall health as fair or poor. Our preliminary research based on three data sets reveals yet another paradox: for a broad range of health-related behaviors and health outcomes, the social gradients in health for Latino youth and adults are weak or virtually non-existent in contrast to the generally strong gradients for whites. In the proposed project, we will systematically investigate the relationships between socioeconomic status, immigrant status, health behavior, and health outcomes for Latinos in the United States. Although our principal focus will be the Latino population, we will also examine these relationships for other ethnic groups. In addition, we will investigate associations between socioeconomic status and health outcomes in Mexico, which is the largest sending country for Latino immigrants in the U.S. Data for the analysis will come from waves 1 and 2 of the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, from the National Health Interview Survey, and from the Mexican Encuesta Nacional de Salud. Our overall goal is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of Latino health.              ",Social Disparities in Health Among Latinos,8076183,R01HD051764,"['Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Smoking ', ' Occupational Status ', ' African ', ' age group ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' residence ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Teenagers ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Perception ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Accounting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Country ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Woman ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Literature ', ' base ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Research ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' social disparities ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' social ', ' Knowledge ', ' Testing ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' United States ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Health ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Stress ', ' Complex ', ' Population ', ' Data ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling ', ' Pattern ', ' biomarker ', ' Time ', ' Respondent ', ' Reporting ', ' Infant ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' County ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Outcome ', ' Measures ', ' sex ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Immigrant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Central American ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' drinking ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Mexico ', ' Native Americans ', ' Mexican ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Surveys ', ' National origin ', ' Legal Status ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2011,418037,0.211954763785763
"Cuentos de la Vida: Exploring Cultural Heritage through Storytelling    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections  indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008).  Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003).  Concomitant with this population growth is a pressing need to address significant social-emotional, behavioral, and academic disparities between Latino children and non-Latino white children (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005). Perceptions of a closed school community have been found to create or exacerbate problems with academic performance, educational aspirations, and behavioral-emotional functioning for Latino youth (Romero and Roberts, 2003; Szalacha et al., 2003; Vega et al., 1995). Intervention and prevention research suggests social acceptance of Latino students and integration into the school community are key environmental factors that promote positive functioning (Ibaqez et al., 2004; Suarez-Orozco and Suarez-Orozco, 1995; Valencia, 2002). The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to continue the research and development of a school-based cultural heritage curriculum for upper elementary school students, Cultural Heritage Stories for Kids: Latino Series (hereafter CHSK:LS), to create the full product, including a story library of traditional and acculturation stories from different Latino cultures (e.g., Mexican American, Puerto Rican,  Cuban), presented by professional Latino storytellers in both English and Spanish. CHSK:LS will provide school professionals with an innovative effective universal classroom intervention specifically designed to celebrate Latino cultural heritage, promote understanding of cultural diversity in the classroom, and engender a more integrated, accepting classroom environment. During Phase I, the CHSK:LS prototype materials were evaluated very positively by school professionals as well as parents and children. However, specific suggestions for Phase II development were noted. The first aim of Phase II will be to revise and extend based on the feedback attained during Phase I, Phase II stakeholder input, and expert advice of Advisory Board members. Once the CHSK:LS product is completed, the second aim of Phase II will be to conduct a rigorous test of the product efficacy via a randomized treatment-control experimental design assessing change as a function of participation in CHSK-LS for two sets of outcomes: (a) individual student-level social, behavioral, emotional, and academic functioning at school and (b) overall classroom climate. The third aim will be to the finalize all product materials based on Phase II findings and evaluations from product testing, package all components for commercialization, and ready the product for  broad-scale dissemination through our commercialization partner. The proposed Phase II SBIR project will result in a highly innovative intervention package with substantial competitive advantages, providing schools with a much needed evidence-based intervention package to promote multicultural awareness and integration, and address behavioral health disparities for Latino students.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections  indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008).  Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003). From 1993 to 2003, the number of minority school enrollments increased from 34 to 41 percent, with Latino students accounting for the majority of that increase (6 percentage points; NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007). Compared  to non-Latino white children, Latino children are at profoundly greater risk for a wide variety of academic  problems (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005), including lower school engagement, grades,  and test scores (NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007; NCES Status and Trends in Edu of Hisp, 2003). In addition, perceived discrimination and insecurity about ethnic identity has been linked to externalizing behavior problems, increased depressive symptoms, and diminished self-esteem (Umaqa-Taylor and Updegraff, 2007, Vega et al., 1995). Culturally specific factors, such as a cultural mismatch between the home and school community, low school integration, and negative stereotyping, have been shown to contribute to decreased school performance (Kroth, 2009; USDEd, 2000; Viadero, 2000). Further, an increasingly frustrating school environment for Latino students can foster high levels of absenteeism and school dropout rates. Nearly 50 percent of Latino students do not graduate from high school (Orfield et al., 2004). Dropping out of school, in turn, has serious consequences for Latino youth, placing them at risk for unemployment, reduced income, diminished health outcomes, use of public assistance, and increased likelihood for delinquent, criminal, and risk-taking behaviors (see Sweeten et al., 2009). Furthermore, the financial costs to society of school dropout are great.  Approximately 600,000 youth drop out of high school each year in the Unites States (Muennig, 2000). It has been estimated that if those students had completed their high school diplomas instead, states could save more than $2.3 billion in public insurance utilization and student gains in lifetime earnings could be as much as $72 billion dollars (Muennig, 2000).          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008).

Culturally specific factors, such as a cultural mismatch between the home and school community, low school integration, and negative stereotyping, have been shown to contribute to decreased school performance (Kroth, 2009; USDEd, 2000; Viadero, 2000). Further, an increasingly frustrating school environment for Latino students can foster high levels of absenteeism and school dropout rates. Nearly 50 percent of Latino students do not graduate from high school (Orfield et al., 2004). Dropping out of school, in turn, has serious consequences for Latino youth, placing them at risk for unemployment, reduced income, diminished health outcomes, use of public assistance, and increased likelihood for delinquent, criminal, and risk-taking behaviors (see Sweeten et al., 2009). Furthermore, the financial costs to society of school dropout are great. Approximately 600,000 youth drop out of high school each year in the Unites States (Muennig, 2000). It has been estimated that if those students had completed their high school diplomas instead, states could save more than $2.3 billion in public insurance utilization and student gains in lifetime earnings could be as much as $72 billion dollars (Muennig, 2000).",Cuentos de la Vida: Exploring Cultural Heritage through Storytelling,8133526,R44HD059283,"['Self Concept ', ' Scientific Evaluation ', ' Cuba ', ' Loneliness ', ' Censuses ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Advocate ', ' Financial cost ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Update ', ' Instruction ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Attitude ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Control Groups ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Reporting ', ' Methods ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Subgroup ', ' Health ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Societies ', ' Accounting ', ' Libraries ', ' Emotional ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' base ', ' Marketing ', ' Goals ', ' Outcome ', ' United States ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Research ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Printing ', ' trend ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavioral ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' prototype ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Students ', ' public health relevance ', ' Life ', ' Recommendation ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Schools ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Link ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Fostering ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Drops ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Writing ', ' Modeling ', ' member ', ' Feedback ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Modification ', ' Behavior ', ' meetings ', ' Individual ', ' Series ', ' programs ', ' Population ', ' Letters ', ' Parents ', ' Environment ', ' Risk ', ' Area ', ' usability ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Performance ', ' social ', ' American ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Communities ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Insurance ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' product development ', ' teacher ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Perception ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Suggestion ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Sales ', ' Latino ', ' peer ', ' Guidelines ', ' satisfaction ', ' behavioral health ', ' evidence base ', ' Peer Review ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' commercialization ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' high school ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' efficacy testing ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Training ', ' Persons ', ' Age ', ' Address ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Minority ', ' Evaluation ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' self esteem ', ' Terminology ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Staff Development ', ' Public Assistance ', ' Videotape ', ' School Enrollments ', ' Population Growth ', ' Absenteeism ', ' commercial application ', ' technological innovation ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Counselor ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Stereotyping ', ' elementary school ', ' Happiness ', ' positive attitude ', ' ']",NICHD,3-C INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT,R44,2011,289935,0.1802212179690082
"Kansas Community Cancer Health Disparities Network American Indian and Latino populations suffer from significant cancer disparities. Rural Al and Latino  communities, in geographically large states, such as Kansas, experience even greater access to cancer  screening and treatment disadvantage due to dispersion of specialists and facilities. The Kansas Community  Cancer Disparities Network (KCCDN) headquartered at the University of Kansas Medical Center will  concentrate on reaching rural Al and Latinos with innovative programs to improve knowledge, access and  utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral cancer procedures. Using community based participatory  research methods (CBPR) and linking our primary care research network (the Kansas Physicians Engaged  in Prevention Research, KPEPR) to our newly formed Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) hospital network, we  will improve outreach, research, and training on cancer disparities in two rural counties; Finney County (SW  Kansas; Latino) and Brown County (NE Kansas; Al). Our CNP Network will capitalize on thriving research  programs offered in our AHECS, Telemedicine Center and safety-net clinic system (Kansas Association for  the Medically Underserved, KAMU), and it will leverage strong and trusting relationships we have built while  providing service and collecting needs assessment data in both the regional Al and Latino communities.  Effective, standing community advisory boards (CABs) in each community were consulted directly during the  design and planning of this proposal and we have structured a CNP Network governance that assures  community interests come first. Our Outreach Core activities will build on the strengths available within the  MCA, KPEPR, and the Telemedicine Office and allow for expanded and improved education through  promotores, IT resources, and theory-driven strategic communications and a social marketing campaigns.  With direct input from rural partners we will conduct a rigorous and controlled clinical trial, testing the efficacy  of a novel intervention based on the ""implementation intentions"" construct to promote breast cancer  screening in Latina and Al women (PI, Engelman). Our Pilot Educational Project will utilize promotores and  ties to the MCA network to enhance knowledge, awareness and interest in cancer clinical trials among  targeted Al and Latino communities (PI, Cupertino). Our Training Core program will rest on a strong  foundation formed by our K30 clinical research curriculum program and an interdisciplinary T-32 fellowship  program (PI, Greiner) specifically designed to train health disparities researchers through community-based  research activities. Our KCCDN will succeed in reducing cancer disparities for Kansas' rural Latinos and  American Indians because it creates a vision for seamless blending access to care enhancements, culturally  tailored educational outreach, rigorous research, and junior investigator CBPR training. Using the building  blocks already in place, our model program will reach vulnerable minorities and generate disseminable  knowledge for the national CNP consortium.

"Toda Promotora Clearinghouse: Supporting nonprofits' use of promotores    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Fast Track Small Business Innovation Research application, submitted by KDH Research and Communication (KDHRC), is to develop and evaluate an online information clearinghouse to support community-based nonprofit organizations' (NPOs) use of promotores programs to provide health information to underserved Latinos. Promotores programs use community health workers (CHWs) to conduct outreach for health promotion, prevention, and medical treatment, and there is increasing evidence that they improve health outcomes. The proposed Toda Promotora Clearinghouse (TPC) will provide information on the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of promotores programs to Latino-serving NPOs. Through the provision of centralized, scientifically-based information, TPC will support NPOs in the effective use of promotores programs to increase positive health outcomes among the clients that they serve.  The need for TPC is significant. Latino populations experience health disparities, or detrimental differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, and access to care. NPOs are often at the forefront of addressing health disparities because they are key providers of health services, particularly for Latinos that may seek community-based health care because of lack of insurance, language barriers, or distrust of the mainstream medical system. But the recent economic downturn and governmental funding cuts have strained the fiscal capacity of many NPOs, necessitating the development and implementation of low-cost, yet effective, service delivery approaches. One promising approach is the use of promotores programs, but there is a lack of systematic information available to NPOs about their optimal formulation, implementation, and evaluation. Therefore, TPC aims to improve Latino health outcomes by increasing the health delivery capacity of Latino-serving NPOs through a clearinghouse of evidence-based information on establishing effective or improving existing promotores programs.  In Phase I of TPC we will conduct extensive formative research with a panel of experts in the field and NPO directors. We will then develop a TPC prototype and conduct a feasibility evaluation using a pretest/post test control group design. The evaluation will to examine the extent to which the TPC prototype changes knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about promotores programming in a group of NPO directors.  In Phase II, we will finalize TPC by developing additional content and features for the website. We will then conduct an outcome evaluation that will include two studies. The first study will use similar methodology to the feasibility evaluation. The second evaluation will be a process study of how and to what extent NPOs and their directors use TPC and how its use impacts promotores programmatic outcomes. Together, the two evaluations will provide information for the commercialization of TPC and a wealth of data for publishing.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: TPC will significantly impact public health in two ways. First, TPC will provide a publicly available, centralized source of evidence-based, practical information on effective promotores programming. Such a resource will allow nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to maximize their funding and not ""reinvent the wheel"" to formulate, implement, and evaluate promotora programs. The ultimate result of TPC will be increased use of effective health outreach programs by NPOs using promotores programs and, subsequently, improved health outcomes for Latinos. Second, the TPC project will generate significant primary data on health delivery by NPO health organizations that serve Latinos. By analyzing these data and disseminating our research results through multiple sources, we will contribute to the scientific literature on NPO effectiveness, promotores programs, and health outreach overall. The innovation of TPC lies in its ability to meet the documented need for systematic, widely disseminated, and replicable information on the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of promotores programs.           TPC will significantly impact public health in two ways.

"Effective Care of Latinos with Diabetes and Limited English Proficiency    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to PA-09-262: NIDDK: Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases. Ineffective diabetes care impacts patient well-being, health outcomes, health care costs and contributes to racial and ethnic disparities. Latinos have high rates of diabetes and well-documented disparities in diabetes care and outcomes. Factors recognized as contributing to disparities in diabetes outcomes for Latinos include lack of health insurance, financial barriers to accessing treatments, and limited English proficiency. Latinos with limited English proficiency (LEP) now constitute 44% of Latino adults. Health care systems are struggling to provide clinical care to Latinos with LEP and diabetes using either bilingual clinicians or interpreter services. The comparative effectiveness of these language access strategies with respect to clinical outcomes is not known. In a prior study, in a setting with uniform access to care and professional medical interpreters, we found that Latino patients with LEP were less likely to have poor glycemic control if they identified their physician as fluent in Spanish. We now propose to build on our work by examining multiple clinical outcomes using richly detailed data from a 5-year longitudinal cohort of Latinos enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California-Diabetes Registry. The overarching goals of this proposal are: to determine whether language proficiency is a root cause of diabetes disparities among Latinos; provide essential information on the comparative effectiveness of two strategies to overcome language barriers (bilingual clinicians versus professional medical interpreters); deepen understanding of how language barriers influence patient and physician behavior (medication adherence and clinical inertia); and determine if there are aspects of interpreter use that can be modified to improve the outcomes of language discordant care. Our results will inform health systems and clinicians seeking to improve diabetes care for Latinos with LEP and will provide a framework for intervention studies to reduce disparities for this population.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos are the largest minority population in the US and have high and rising prevalence of diabetes and diabetes complications. Disparities between Latinos and whites in diabetes outcomes appear to be increasing. Limited English proficiency (LEP), which currently affects 44% of Latino adults, may contribute to less effective health care, but the role of language barriers in diabetes care is unclear. This observational study will use data from an insured patient population to examine whether LEP status is associated with disparities in diabetes outcomes among Latinos, and compare the effectiveness of two strategies for overcoming language barriers (language concordant (Spanish-speaking) physicians versus professional interpreters) and reducing disparities. Our overarching goal is to improve the quality of healthcare for Latinos with diabetes.           Latinos are the largest minority population in the US and have high and rising prevalence of diabetes and diabetes complications.

"Johns Hopkins Healthy Eyes Translational Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this cooperative agreement is to assess and evaluate system level and individual level factors that impact access to eye care; and to identify barriers and enablers to the delivery of eye care conforming to best practices that prevent vision loss and promote eye health. The Johns Hopkins Translational Research Center (TRC) will analyze multiple existing databases to develop a knowledge base for a public health interventions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities and improving the eye health of underserved populations in the United States. Specifically, we will focus on focus on cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Finally, we propose a collaborative study that uses this knowledge for implementation at the city level. The first set of analyses will focus on personal and perceived system barriers associated with the uptake of eyecare services in three previously studied populations: African Americans and Caucasians from the Salisbury Eye Evaluation (SEE) study and Latinos living in Arizona (studied as part of Proyecto Ver) and Latinos living in Baltimore (evaluated in the ProVision study funded by the NIH). The barriers and enablers of obtaining cataract surgical services will be assessed in all three racial/ethnic groups, whereas factors related to screening for diabetic retinopathy will be addressed using the two Latino populations, supplemented with analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Finally, the rates of glaucoma screening provided using the Medicare screening benefit as well as the rates and patterns of treatment of glaucoma will be assessed using data from Medicare. Additionally, NHANES has both visual field and optic nerve imaging and these data will be used to determine associations with having been diagnosed with glaucoma when it is present in order to identify groups at high risk for underdiagnosis. The proposed TRC network combined project will consist of establishing diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening surveillance systems in collaboration with city governments to be able to monitor patterns of care, especially among at risk underserved populations. An intervention will be tested to increase DR screening rates based on the findings of the analyses described above. Finally, a pre/post assessment will be made to see if the intervention might be expanded nationally.              Project Narrative This study is highly relevant to the public health. Findings from this research will inform policy planners and insurance administrators of key barriers and enablers associated with the major blinding eye conditions faced by minority populations in the United States.

"Reducing Cancer Disparaties Among Latinos in Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Texas regional Community Networks Program, Latinos Contra El Cancer, combines innovative research, extensive community outreach, and a multi-faceted training program, all conducted within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) context, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in Latinos, and to build a cadre of competitive health disparities researchers trained in CBPR in three regions of Texas (Houston, El Paso, the Lower Rio Grande Valley). This will be accomplished through the work of three distinct yet complementary cores (Outreach, Research, and Training) to integrate knowledge generation, community health education, and community and researcher capacity building within and across the three sites, building on existing research infrastructures, longstanding relationships, and novel communication systems. The overarching goals of each Core are described below.  The goal of the proposed Outreach Program is to increase the use of evidence-based biomedical and behavioral procedures and interventions to reduce the cancer burden among Latinos in Texas. We will build on existing community partnerships, infrastructure, and programs to develop an Outreach Program that will accomplish this goal through capacity building with community partners and direct health promotion in Latino communities.  The goal of the Research Core - Intervention Study is to develop and evaluate an innovative intervention approach for reducing cancer risk related to the three leading behavioral risk factors for cancer: smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity. The project will focus on participants in a longitudinal study of cancer risk factors among Mexican Americans in Houston (Mexican American Cohort Study).  The goal of the Research Core - Pilot Study is to utilize quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the socio-demographic, acculturation, and psychosocial factors that influence Mexican Americans willingness to provide biologic specimens for biobanking.

"Health Communication & Health Literacy to Improve Care for Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes disparities are common for Latino patients. Effective health communication can potentially narrow these disparities. This proposal details a career development plan that will prepare the principal investigator (PI) for success as an independent investigator with expertise in diabetes-related outcomes, health communication, and delivery of behavioral interventions for Latino diabetes patients. As an Internal Medicine- Pediatrics physician, with training in clinical investigation, the PI will gain new skills through this K23 in the areas of health disparities specific to diabetes care, enhanced Latino cultural competency, audio taping clinical encounters to assess the quality and role of health communication, and the development of a new training program for medical interpreters. The PI's immediate goals are to rigorously examine the quality of health communication between Latino diabetes patients, providers, and Spanish interpreters and the association between health communication and various diabetes-related health outcomes. To meet this goal, the PI has proposed a rigorous career development plan that incorporates additional didactic course work, regular participation in local and national meetings/seminars, a mentored research experience, and active involvement in an extremely supportive research environment. This includes an NIDDK funded Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC), NCRR-funded Meharry Clinical and Translational Research Center (MeTRC), Vanderbilt Program on Effective Health Communication (EHC), and an RCMI-funded Bioinformatics Core. The research specific aims are to: 1) conduct a cross-sectional, descriptive mixed-methods analysis of the quality of health communication between providers and Latino diabetes patients with particular emphasis on the role of the Spanish medical interpreter during language discordant encounters, and explore the association between baseline quality of health communication and various diabetes related health outcomes, 2) conduct an observational cohort study to examine the independent effect of provider health communication training and the use of a Spanish, literacy-sensitive educational toolkit on the quality of health communication during medical encounters, and assess the association between changes in the quality of health communication at 12 months with changes in diabetes related health outcomes, and 3) develop and pilot in a small RCT, an enhanced training program for Spanish medical interpreters geared toward improving their ability to work with providers and patients with LEP and limited health literacy during language discordant encounters. Overall, this K23 program will provide important insights into the nature of health communication with Latinos, the role of Spanish interpreters in this process, and most importantly prepare the PI for independent investigation of the role of effective health communication in addressing disparities in care for Latinos with diabetes.

"A Church-Based, Self-Management Intervention for Mexican-Americans with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term research objective is to become a nationally respected, independent community-based researcher, with a specific focus on using faith-based interventions to reduce diabetes disparities among Latinos. Diabetes is a very prevalent and morbid condition affecting Latinos, especially Mexican-Americans in the United States. Many church-based interventions have shown promise improving health outcomes among minority populations; but data on church-based interventions for Latino populations is scarce. Considering that the church is a center of Latino family and culture, interventions based in churches has promise to have great impact on this population. To our knowledge, no other studies have focused on designing church-based interventions for Latinos with diabetes. My research to date has already allowed me accomplish many of my short-term objectives in my path to becoming an independent academic researcher. With the support from the career development award, I will have the opportunity to refine my skills in community-based research methods and design interventions to tackle health disparities and foster change in Latino communities. I have the following short-term goals over the next five years that I will focus on in this proposal: 1) To gain additional research training and skills; 2) To assess the facilitators and barriers of local healthcare providers in linking to church-based diabetes, self-management interventions; 3) To design a church-based, culturally-appropriate patient intervention in partnership with faith-based institutions and local healthcare institutions to increase self- management of Latino patients with diabetes; 4) To pilot the intervention among Latinos with diabetes with the goal of improving their diabetes outcomes. Considering the growth of the Hispanic population and their disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, developing community based programming and linking these programs to the local healthcare system is crucial to decrease the health disparities among Latinos and has promise to have a high impact on diabetes outcomes on this community.

"Cancer Survivorship:  Telling a Story through the Eyes of  ""Esperanza"" (Hope)  Ap This proposal will be building upon a prior positive collaborative working relationship between the community-based, minority serving institution, Padres Contra El Cancer [Parents against Cancer] (PADRES) and the Childhood Cancer Survivorship Program at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JOCC). The four years of the grant will establish infrastructure support required to sustain the ongoing research collaboration. PADRES and UCLA will synergy their efforts to better understand and address the needs of Latino childhood cancer survivors and their families. The objectives for the overall research strategy include: (1) formalize the infrastructure of the community-academic research partnership between PADRES and the JCCC in order to understand how to best develop culturally-relevant survivorship educational interventions for the Latino pediatric, adolescent, and young adult survivorship community given their risk for late effects; (2) to test the effectiveness of this intervention developed through this collaborative research partnership and disseminate the significant findings nationally for the mutual benefits of both partners; (3) through the development of the formalized research infrastructure, leadership within the PADRES/JCCC partnership will be able provide education, training, and empowerment to its diverse groups of members regarding how to improve access to cancer survivorship care through the model of community-based participatory research and be a resource for guidance to other programs nationally. This partnership will bring together the expertise and experience of the Internal Advisory Committee and Community Advisory Board to develop a culturally-relevant survivorship educational intervention during the implementation stage. The intervention will be tested for its acceptability and feasibility for delivery in the community setting. The expected outcome of this study is to develop the intervention in the form of a photonovela which can then be tested nationally in the Latino survivor community for its effectiveness to decrease stigma and improve families' survivorship care discussions and knowledge about the importance of survivorship care planning. This partnership will address health disparities highlighted in the Institute of Medicine's report on Childhood Cancer Survivorship: Improving Care and Quality of Life, President's Cancer Panel 2010 meeting, and Healthy People's 2010 objectives. Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for eariy morbidity and mortality due to previous cancer treatment. Cancer stigma among Latino families affected by cancer coupled with the knowledge gap regarding the need for survivorship-focused care may widen the existing health disparities for the Latino population.","Cancer Survivorship:  Telling a Story through the Eyes of  ""Esperanza"" (Hope)  Ap",8323959,P20CA157070,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Parents ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Siblings ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Survivors ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pediatric neoplasm/cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' meetings ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' CCSS ', ' Childhood Cancer Survivor Study ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' pediatric cancer survivor ', ' childhood cancer survivor ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' chemotherapy ', ' community based participatory research ', ' community setting ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P20,2012,198702,0.052588349208115545
"Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance Abstract  The purpose of the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA) is to ameliorate the lack of highly qualified first-generation-educated Latino graduates prepared to engage in graduate degrees in health disparities research in both biomedical and health science-related disciplines. Latinos have been and continue to be gravely underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social science disciplines. In 2009 Latinos made up fewer than 5% of all medical scientists, despite being 15.8% of the US population, the largest minority group. Although Latinos represent a growing proportion of college admissions, they continue to lag behind in enrollment and degree completion (Becerra 2010). Entry-level science courses (e.g. chemistry, biology) tend to eliminate Latinos students from advancement in science degrees. In response to this critical educational deficit, and with support from the NIMHD Science Education Initiative, the NCLR/CSULB Center for Latino Community Health, Evaluation, and Leadership Training, will develop the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA).  HOLA will provide health disparities research training and tutoring in science to Latino students in their sophomore and junior years, thus widening the pool of minority applicants for advanced degrees. Moreover, HOLA will be open to students across the natural and health sciences reaching out to pre-health majors who otherwise would not be eligible to participate in existing research opportunities.  HOLA will provide 140 Latino undergraduate students and 30 minority graduate students with educational, mentoring, and career development opportunities designed to facilitate careers in health disparities research through the delivery of: 1) targeted undergraduate tutoring in diverse science courses for Latino pre-health and health science students; 2) workshops in health disparities research methods; 3) health disparities seminars highlighting population-specific issues; and, 4) an annual health disparities conference.

"Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors in Puerto Rican Youth Growing Up     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use/abuse (SU/SUD) and other HIV/STI risk behaviors are major public health challenges not equally distributed across racial/ethnic groups. The fastest growing minority population in the US, Latino  youth, have elevated rates HIV/STI risk behaviors and SU/SUD, particularly among those abandoning  traditional Latino values and shifting towards American values (acculturation). This application, in response to  PA-09-236: HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations in the US (R01), aims to identify factors related  to the development of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection among Latino youth during a critical  transitional developmental period: emerging adulthood. Existing studies have revealed important disparities, however, they are limited in their ability to identify processes relevant for Latino youth, as they have not included sufficient numbers of Latino youth from fairly homogeneous subgroups (e.g.  Puerto Ricans, Mexican- Americans, etc.) and lack information about acculturation, a key determinant of risk among Latino youth. We propose to conduct the fourth wave on the Boricua Youth Study (BYS~ R01 MH56401) focused on HIV/STI risk, infection in emerging adulthood (BYS Wave 4, N=1,992, youth ages 16 - 24). The BYS has already generated 3 waves of data (years 2001 to 2004) on children of Puerto Rican background (ages 5 -13 at Wave 1), with study findings described in 19 peer-reviewed publications to date. Besides the comprehensive longitudinal assessment strategy, a unique feature of the BYS is its two-site design, as it included children living in the South Bronx (SBx), NYC and San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR). At BYS Wave 4, we propose to conduct intensive assessment of HIV/STI risk (including testing for HIV and STIs) and enhance the assessment of SU/SUD, in addition to continuing tracking of cultural experiences, and psychiatric disorders and other factors. The proposed study has as its specific aims, to examine: (I) Prevalence of HIV/STI risk behaviors and rates of HIV/STI infection in emerging adulthood and the influence of sexual orientation, teenage unintended pregnancy and early sexual debut. (II) How development of SU/SUD (nicotine, alcohol, illicit/prescription drugs) starting in childhood/earlyadolescence may influence HIV/STI risk in emerging adulthood in the context of a  Ecodevelopmental framework. (III) The role of acculturation (cultural practices, identification, values) in relation to SU/SUD and its relationship to HIV/STI risk behaviors/infection.   Once Wave 4 is completed, the BYS will represent an unparalleled source of prospective information  about onset of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection  as well as persistence and progression of SU  from childhood to emerging adulthood in a homogeneous Latino subgroup examined in two contexts (SBx and  PR).This information will fill a gap in knowledge, and the model resulting from our investigation will enable and  facilitate the integration of specific factrs of relevance for Latino youth (e.g., acculturation) as part of  interventions for this high-risk group.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: A population-based longitudinal study is the best strategy to understand specific mechanisms involved in processes determining HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in relation to substance use and abuse among high-risk youth who are part of the fastest growing US minority group194 and whose risk experience have not been properly addressed to date (given for example, the superficial assessment as issues such as acculturation). By adding a 4th wave of data to the Boricua Youth Study (which started about 10 years ago), we can, in 5 years (rather than in 15, if a cohort like that had to established today a a very high cost), close a key gap in knowledge and generate information about risk and protective factors as well as mechanisms  operating in the determination HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in the lives of a high-risk Latino group  (Puerto Ricans), directly informing highly needed intervention advancement, contributing to revert important  health disparities.                       A population-based longitudinal study is the best strategy to understand specific mechanisms involved in processes determining HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in relation to substance use and abuse among high-risk youth who are part of the fastest growing US minority group194 and whose risk experience have not been properly addressed to date (given for example, the superficial assessment as issues such as acculturation).

"Engaging Latino Families in Eating Disorders Treatment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Candidate: Mae Lynn Reyes-Rodriguez, Clinical Assistant Professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, has a Minority Supplement from the National Institute of Mental Health to adapt a novel couple- based intervention for adults with anorexia nervosa for Latinos [UCAN: Uniting Couples (in the treatment of) Anorexia Nervosa]. Career goals: To become an independent investigator in the field of eating disorders specializing in working with the Latino population. Career Development: This award will enable Dr. Reyes- Rodriguez to continue her development as a patient-oriented researcher. The candidate plans to: 1) gain new competencies in health disparities, design and conduct of clinical trials, statistical analysis of clinical trial data, and theories of community-based intervention; 2) gain further training and experience in the responsible conduct of research relevant for a clinical trials investigator, cultural diversity, family-based intervention models, Latino mental health, and integrating biomarker studies into clinical trials; and 3) develop the necessary research skills, preliminary data, grant writing skills and record of scholarly productivity to become competitive for independent NIH funding. Mentorship: These goals will be achieved through: 1) the mentorship of Drs. Cynthia Bulik (eating disorders). Marci Campbell (health disparities), Donald Baucom (clinical trials) and Kimberly Brownley (biomarkers); 2) consultation with Drs. Robert Hamer (statistical methods), and Drs. Margarita Alegria, Concepcion Barrio, Anne Becker and Debra Franko (Latino health and cultural adaptation); 3) coursework, workshops, and other structured didactic activities; and the execution of the proposed research project. Research Study: Research on culturally sensitive assessment and treatment of eating disorders among Latinos is scarce. Providing culturally sensitive treatments for Latinos with psychiatric disorders is essential to reverse public health disparities. The specific aims of this study are: 1) to gather comprehensive qualitative information about the appropriate role for family members in the treatment of eating disorders in Latino adults; 2) to develop and manualize an adjunctive family intervention to augment Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) for eating disorders for Latino adults; 3) to pre-test the family intervention adjunctive intervention; and 4) to compare individual CBT + FE versus individual CBT in a proof-of-principle study. Environment: This study will take place at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with the collaboration of Latino community centers in Chapel Hill. Relevance: The proposed series of investigations will yield a culturally sensitive evidence-based treatment model for Latinos with eating disorders ready for testing in a larger multi-site clinical trial as well as for adaptation for community delivery. The use of a community-based approach will enable a practical treatment model in order to enhance engagement and retention in treatment in the Latino population while delivering high quality mental health intervention.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Given the need for further research on the assessment and treatment of eating disorders within the Latino population, as well as culturally appropriate treatment of eating disorders, this project intends to contribute to our knowledge and to provide culturally sensitive treatments of eating disorders in Latinos.

"Toda Promotora Clearinghouse: Supporting nonprofits' use of promotores    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Fast Track Small Business Innovation Research application, submitted by KDH Research and Communication (KDHRC), is to develop and evaluate an online information clearinghouse to support community-based nonprofit organizations' (NPOs) use of promotores programs to provide health information to underserved Latinos. Promotores programs use community health workers (CHWs) to conduct outreach for health promotion, prevention, and medical treatment, and there is increasing evidence that they improve health outcomes. The proposed Toda Promotora Clearinghouse (TPC) will provide information on the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of promotores programs to Latino-serving NPOs. Through the provision of centralized, scientifically-based information, TPC will support NPOs in the effective use of promotores programs to increase positive health outcomes among the clients that they serve.  The need for TPC is significant. Latino populations experience health disparities, or detrimental differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, and access to care. NPOs are often at the forefront of addressing health disparities because they are key providers of health services, particularly for Latinos that may seek community-based health care because of lack of insurance, language barriers, or distrust of the mainstream medical system. But the recent economic downturn and governmental funding cuts have strained the fiscal capacity of many NPOs, necessitating the development and implementation of low-cost, yet effective, service delivery approaches. One promising approach is the use of promotores programs, but there is a lack of systematic information available to NPOs about their optimal formulation, implementation, and evaluation. Therefore, TPC aims to improve Latino health outcomes by increasing the health delivery capacity of Latino-serving NPOs through a clearinghouse of evidence-based information on establishing effective or improving existing promotores programs.  In Phase I of TPC we will conduct extensive formative research with a panel of experts in the field and NPO directors. We will then develop a TPC prototype and conduct a feasibility evaluation using a pretest/post test control group design. The evaluation will to examine the extent to which the TPC prototype changes knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about promotores programming in a group of NPO directors.  In Phase II, we will finalize TPC by developing additional content and features for the website. We will then conduct an outcome evaluation that will include two studies. The first study will use similar methodology to the feasibility evaluation. The second evaluation will be a process study of how and to what extent NPOs and their directors use TPC and how its use impacts promotores programmatic outcomes. Together, the two evaluations will provide information for the commercialization of TPC and a wealth of data for publishing.        TPC will significantly impact public health in two ways. First, TPC will provide a publicly available, centralized source of evidence-based, practical information on effective promotores programming. Such a resource will allow nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to maximize their funding and not ""reinvent the wheel"" to formulate, implement, and evaluate promotora programs. The ultimate result of TPC will be increased use of effective health outreach programs by NPOs using promotores programs and, subsequently, improved health outcomes for Latinos. Second, the TPC project will generate significant primary data on health delivery by NPO health organizations that serve Latinos. By analyzing these data and disseminating our research results through multiple sources, we will contribute to the scientific literature on NPO effectiveness, promotores programs, and health outreach overall. The innovation of TPC lies in its ability to meet the documented need for systematic, widely disseminated, and replicable information on the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of promotores programs.

"Life Course Socioeconomics, Acculturation, & Type-2 Diabetes Risk Among Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the US carry a disproportionate burden of type-2 diabetes. Research has implicated life course socioeconomic position as a major factor in the development of chronic diseases, such as type-2 diabetes; yet most evidence is limited to non-Hispanic White populations. We hypothesize that the large disparities in type-2 diabetes among Latinos reflects the joint effect of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic factors, cultural characteristics, behaviors, biology, and other risk factors accumulating over the life course. The experience of Latinos in the US represents an especially fruitful context in which to investigate the influence of life course socioeconomic and cultural resources in relation to type-2 diabetes. In addition to being the fastest growing minority population with high rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes, the experience of Latinos is one that includes first generation immigrants with limited education and job skills, and later generations who are born and raised in the US and show varying levels of acculturation and assimilation, behavioral change, and socioeconomic advancement. With these unique considerations in mind, the present study seeks to: (1) examine the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; (2) assess whether acculturation modifies the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; and 3) examine whether metabolic and inflammatory markers related to behavioral, physiological, and psychosocial risk factors mediate the relationships between life course socioeconomic position, acculturation, and type-2 diabetes among Latinos. The proposed research activity will constitute the first systematic attempt to assess the unique and synergistic contributions of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type 2 diabetes among Latinos. By assessing life course exposures across two generations of Latinos living in the US, this project provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify targets for early intervention for reducing the heavy burden of type-2 diabetes among Latinos. More broadly, the proposed research may uncover crucial life course socioeconomic and cultural patterning of risk factors or health promoting characteristics that may also benefit other race/ethnic minorities disproportionately living in poverty and suffering from type-2 diabetes.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will assess the impact of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type-2 diabetes and examine potential biological mediators, including inflammation, among two generations of US Latinos. The findings from this study will have important public health implications, including identification of critical risk facors and biological mechanisms mediating the effects of life course sociocultural contexts on type-2 diabetes across generations of US Latinos.              The proposed study will assess the impact of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type-2 diabetes and examine potential biological mediators, including inflammation, among two generations of US Latinos.

"Effective Care of Latinos with Diabetes and Limited English Proficiency    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to PA-09-262: NIDDK: Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases. Ineffective diabetes care impacts patient well-being, health outcomes, health care costs and contributes to racial and ethnic disparities. Latinos have high rates of diabetes and well-documented disparities in diabetes care and outcomes. Factors recognized as contributing to disparities in diabetes outcomes for Latinos include lack of health insurance, financial barriers to accessing treatments, and limited English proficiency. Latinos with limited English proficiency (LEP) now constitute 44% of Latino adults. Health care systems are struggling to provide clinical care to Latinos with LEP and diabetes using either bilingual clinicians or interpreter services. The comparative effectiveness of these language access strategies with respect to clinical outcomes is not known. In a prior study, in a setting with uniform access to care and professional medical interpreters, we found that Latino patients with LEP were less likely to have poor glycemic control if they identified their physician as fluent in Spanish. We now propose to build on our work by examining multiple clinical outcomes using richly detailed data from a 5-year longitudinal cohort of Latinos enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California-Diabetes Registry. The overarching goals of this proposal are: to determine whether language proficiency is a root cause of diabetes disparities among Latinos; provide essential information on the comparative effectiveness of two strategies to overcome language barriers (bilingual clinicians versus professional medical interpreters); deepen understanding of how language barriers influence patient and physician behavior (medication adherence and clinical inertia); and determine if there are aspects of interpreter use that can be modified to improve the outcomes of language discordant care. Our results will inform health systems and clinicians seeking to improve diabetes care for Latinos with LEP and will provide a framework for intervention studies to reduce disparities for this population.        Latinos are the largest minority population in the US and have high and rising prevalence of diabetes and diabetes complications. Disparities between Latinos and whites in diabetes outcomes appear to be increasing. Limited English proficiency (LEP), which currently affects 44% of Latino adults, may contribute to less effective health care, but the role of language barriers in diabetes care is unclear. This observational study will use data from an insured patient population to examine whether LEP status is associated with disparities in diabetes outcomes among Latinos, and compare the effectiveness of two strategies for overcoming language barriers (language concordant (Spanish-speaking) physicians versus professional interpreters) and reducing disparities. Our overarching goal is to improve the quality of healthcare for Latinos with diabetes.

"Reducing Cancer Disparaties Among Latinos in Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Texas regional Community Networks Program, Latinos Contra El Cancer, combines innovative research, extensive community outreach, and a multi-faceted training program, all conducted within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) context, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in Latinos, and to build a cadre of competitive health disparities researchers trained in CBPR in three regions of Texas (Houston, El Paso, the Lower Rio Grande Valley). This will be accomplished through the work of three distinct yet complementary cores (Outreach, Research, and Training) to integrate knowledge generation, community health education, and community and researcher capacity building within and across the three sites, building on existing research infrastructures, longstanding relationships, and novel communication systems. The overarching goals of each Core are described below.  The goal of the proposed Outreach Program is to increase the use of evidence-based biomedical and behavioral procedures and interventions to reduce the cancer burden among Latinos in Texas. We will build on existing community partnerships, infrastructure, and programs to develop an Outreach Program that will accomplish this goal through capacity building with community partners and direct health promotion in Latino communities.  The goal of the Research Core - Intervention Study is to develop and evaluate an innovative intervention approach for reducing cancer risk related to the three leading behavioral risk factors for cancer: smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity. The project will focus on participants in a longitudinal study of cancer risk factors among Mexican Americans in Houston (Mexican American Cohort Study).  The goal of the Research Core - Pilot Study is to utilize quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the socio-demographic, acculturation, and psychosocial factors that influence Mexican Americans willingness to provide biologic specimens for biobanking.

"Reducing Barriers to Autism Care in Latino Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis improves long-term child development and families' ability to cope with this disorder. Latino children are diagnosed with ASDs at older ages and at the point of more severe symptoms, putting them and their families at significant disadvantage. Interventions addressing family, community, and health care systems factors hold promise for improving access to ASD diagnostic services for minority children. The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to reduce ethnic differences in ASD care among Latinos. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a survey of 350 Latino parents of either typically-developing children or children with ASDs, to assess common beliefs about autism in Latino communities, and to assess which community factors, health beliefs, and health care system factors are associated with delays in ASD diagnosis. The survey will be conducted at three sites within the Autism Treatment Network: Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon; University of Colorado/The Children's Hospital in Denver; and University of Pennsylvania/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Based on the barriers found in the survey, we will develop a pilot community-based patient navigator intervention designed to reduce barriers to care. This research will be incorporated into a career development plan that includes increasing the Principal Investigator's knowledge and skills in the areas of autism diagnosis and treatment, mental health disparities, interventional study design, and community-based research. The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and used as the basis for an NIH-funded proposal to conduct a multi-site test of the intervention designed in this project. Over 120,000 U.S. Latino children have been diagnosed with an ASD, a figure that likely underestimates the true prevalence. This project will help such children achieve earlier diagnosis and better long-term prognosis.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to improve rates of early diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders in Latino children.

"Kansas Community Cancer Health Disparities Network American Indian and Latino populations suffer from significant cancer disparities. Rural Al and Latino  communities, in geographically large states, such as Kansas, experience even greater access to cancer  screening and treatment disadvantage due to dispersion of specialists and facilities. The Kansas Community  Cancer Disparities Network (KCCDN) headquartered at the University of Kansas Medical Center will  concentrate on reaching rural Al and Latinos with innovative programs to improve knowledge, access and  utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral cancer procedures. Using community based participatory  research methods (CBPR) and linking our primary care research network (the Kansas Physicians Engaged  in Prevention Research, KPEPR) to our newly formed Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) hospital network, we  will improve outreach, research, and training on cancer disparities in two rural counties; Finney County (SW  Kansas; Latino) and Brown County (NE Kansas; Al). Our CNP Network will capitalize on thriving research  programs offered in our AHECS, Telemedicine Center and safety-net clinic system (Kansas Association for  the Medically Underserved, KAMU), and it will leverage strong and trusting relationships we have built while  providing service and collecting needs assessment data in both the regional Al and Latino communities.  Effective, standing community advisory boards (CABs) in each community were consulted directly during the  design and planning of this proposal and we have structured a CNP Network governance that assures  community interests come first. Our Outreach Core activities will build on the strengths available within the  MCA, KPEPR, and the Telemedicine Office and allow for expanded and improved education through  promotores, IT resources, and theory-driven strategic communications and a social marketing campaigns.  With direct input from rural partners we will conduct a rigorous and controlled clinical trial, testing the efficacy  of a novel intervention based on the ""implementation intentions"" construct to promote breast cancer  screening in Latina and Al women (PI, Engelman). Our Pilot Educational Project will utilize promotores and  ties to the MCA network to enhance knowledge, awareness and interest in cancer clinical trials among  targeted Al and Latino communities (PI, Cupertino). Our Training Core program will rest on a strong  foundation formed by our K30 clinical research curriculum program and an interdisciplinary T-32 fellowship  program (PI, Greiner) specifically designed to train health disparities researchers through community-based  research activities. Our KCCDN will succeed in reducing cancer disparities for Kansas' rural Latinos and  American Indians because it creates a vision for seamless blending access to care enhancements, culturally  tailored educational outreach, rigorous research, and junior investigator CBPR training. Using the building  blocks already in place, our model program will reach vulnerable minorities and generate disseminable  knowledge for the national CNP consortium.

"Cuentos de la Vida: Exploring Cultural Heritage through Storytelling DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008). Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003). Concomitant with this population growth is a pressing need to address significant social-emotional, behavioral, and academic disparities between Latino children and non-Latino white children (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005). Perceptions of a closed school community have been found to create or exacerbate problems with academic performance, educational aspirations, and behavioral-emotional functioning for Latino youth (Romero and Roberts, 2003; Szalacha et al., 2003; Vega et al., 1995). Intervention and prevention research suggests social acceptance of Latino students and integration into the school community are key environmental factors that promote positive functioning (Ibaqez et al., 2004; Suarez-Orozco and Suarez-Orozco, 1995; Valencia, 2002). The goal of this Phase II SBIR project is to continue the research and development of a school-based cultural heritage curriculum for upper elementary school students, Cultural Heritage Stories for Kids: Latino Series (hereafter CHSK:LS), to create the full product, including a story library of traditional and acculturation stories from different Latino cultures (e.g., Mexican American, Puerto Rican, Cuban), presented by professional Latino storytellers in both English and Spanish. CHSK:LS will provide school professionals with an innovative effective universal classroom intervention specifically designed to celebrate Latino cultural heritage, promote understanding of cultural diversity in the classroom, and engender a more integrated, accepting classroom environment. During Phase I, the CHSK:LS prototype materials were evaluated very positively by school professionals as well as parents and children. However, specific suggestions for Phase II development were noted. The first aim of Phase II will be to revise and extend based on the feedback attained during Phase I, Phase II stakeholder input, and expert advice of Advisory Board members. Once the CHSK:LS product is completed, the second aim of Phase II will be to conduct a rigorous test of the product efficacy via a randomized treatment-control experimental design assessing change as a function of participation in CHSK-LS for two sets of outcomes: (a) individual student-level social, behavioral, emotional, and academic functioning at school and (b) overall classroom climate. The third aim will be to the finalize all product materials based on Phase II findings and evaluations from product testing, package all components for commercialization, and ready the product for broad-scale dissemination through our commercialization partner. The proposed Phase II SBIR project will result in a highly innovative intervention package with substantial competitive advantages, providing schools with a much needed evidence-based intervention package to promote multicultural awareness and integration, and address behavioral health disparities for Latino students. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The U.S. Census Bureau estimates the Latino population totals over 46 million people, with projections indicating Latino individuals will account for nearly 1 in 3 U.S. residents by the year 2050 (USCB, 2008). Currently, nearly 40 percent of the Latino population is under the age of 20 (Ramirez and de la Cruz, 2003). From 1993 to 2003, the number of minority school enrollments increased from 34 to 41 percent, with Latino students accounting for the majority of that increase (6 percentage points; NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007). Compared to non-Latino white children, Latino children are at profoundly greater risk for a wide variety of academic problems (Farkas, 2003; USDHHS, 2001; Wright and Troop, 2005), including lower school engagement, grades, and test scores (NCES, KewalRamani et al., 2007; NCES Status and Trends in Edu of Hisp, 2003). In addition, perceived discrimination and insecurity about ethnic identity has been linked to externalizing behavior problems, increased depressive symptoms, and diminished self-esteem (Umaqa-Taylor and Updegraff, 2007, Vega et al., 1995). Culturally specific factors, such as a cultural mismatch between the home and school community, low school integration, and negative stereotyping, have been shown to contribute to decreased school performance (Kroth, 2009; USDEd, 2000; Viadero, 2000). Further, an increasingly frustrating school environment for Latino students can foster high levels of absenteeism and school dropout rates. Nearly 50 percent of Latino students do not graduate from high school (Orfield et al., 2004). Dropping out of school, in turn, has serious consequences for Latino youth, placing them at risk for unemployment, reduced income, diminished health outcomes, use of public assistance, and increased likelihood for delinquent, criminal, and risk-taking behaviors (see Sweeten et al., 2009). Furthermore, the financial costs to society of school dropout are great. Approximately 600,000 youth drop out of high school each year in the Unites States (Muennig, 2000). It has been estimated that if those students had completed their high school diplomas instead, states could save more than $2.3 billion in public insurance utilization and student gains in lifetime earnings could be as much as $72 billion dollars (Muennig, 2000).",Cuentos de la Vida: Exploring Cultural Heritage through Storytelling,8307548,R44HD059283,"['Absenteeism ', ' Accounting ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Financial cost ', ' Counselor ', ' Professional counselor ', ' Cuba ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' positive attitude ', ' Happiness ', ' Health ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Insurance ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Libraries ', ' Loneliness ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Persons ', ' Terminology ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Review ', ' Perception ', ' Population Growth ', ' Printing ', ' Public Assistance ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Sales ', ' School Enrollments ', ' Schools ', ' Self Concept ', ' self esteem ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Societies ', ' Staff Development ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Stress ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' Students ', ' Suggestion ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' United States ', ' Videotape ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Writing ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' Individual ', ' Withdrawal ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Letters ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' elementary school ', ' Performance ', ' high school ', ' Prevention Research ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' technological innovation ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Scientific Evaluation ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Update ', ' trend ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' usability ', ' commercial application ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' evidence base ', ' product development ', ' efficacy testing ', ' ']",NICHD,3-C INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT,R44,2012,436482,0.17309280301382934
"Investing in America's Future: Mentoring Latinos in Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary:  Given the heterogeneity of factors such as culture, acculturation, and socioeconomic status, there is a need for additional research related to cardiovascular health and shared protective and risk factors associated with other chronic diseases specific to Latino subgroups. However, there is an under-representation of Latino scientists and university faculty in the US, which contributes to a limitation in insight among scientists seeking to understand and reverse the negative health disparities experienced by Latino communities. It is thus crucial to train and develop future scientists to increase the body of literature on Latino health and to increase Latino community members' access to culturally competent health information and care. As more Latino researchers are trained, there is greater potential to diversify the workforce and promote culturally sensitive research that encourages the continued inclusion and participation of diverse groups in research studies.  The proposed training program, entitled, ""Investing in America's Future: Mentoring Latinos in Health Disparities Research,"" will bring researchers accomplished in Latino community health research (mentors) together with aspiring younger researchers (mentees) to optimize the chances of research success and advancement among the latter and prepare them in turn to train the next generation of individuals who will be working in Latino health. To advance the scientific career development of the junior Latino faculty and scientists, the proposed team will offer a series of trainings and mentoring activities focused on Latino health and health disparities research as related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other conditions associated with CVD risk factors. These activities, which will involve three separate cohorts of approximately eight Latino mentees each (24 mentees total), will consist of an initial two-week long summer institute, a mid-year visit by a mentor to each of the mentees' research settings, and a second summer institute of one-week, as well as a final meeting of all three cohorts at the conclusion of the study period. Regular communication between mentees and mentors and the provision of a modest stipend to pursue additional training will complement the in-person activities.  The ultimate goal of the program is to equip the junior researchers with the skills necessary to develop manuscripts and submit a grant proposal related to health disparities and CVD within two years of completing the program. The proposed research training program will be evaluated periodically to determine the overall relevance and value of the methods employed. Mentee and mentor feedback will be used to refine the program to best meet the needs of the participants. Further, portions of the program will be disseminated at its conclusion to allow others who are not able to attend to develop productive Latino health research careers using aspects of the training.

"Salud y el Exito: Addressing Proven Factors in HIV Prevention for Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Padres Unidos por la Salud y el ¿xito de Nuestros Hijos aims to support Latino parents and schools in their efforts to promote the healthy choices of children, with the goal of reducing behaviors that lead to elevated levels of HIV/AIDS in urban Latino communities. The study is designed to advance efforts to begin HIV prevention early, during the preteen and young adolescent years, before youth establish patterns of behavior that jeopardize their health and success, or ""Salud y ¿xito."" Salud y ¿xito draws on a solid foundation of theoretical and empirical research that underscores the importance of supporting the primary role that parents play in healthy youth development. The study will test a bilingual version of a multi-year parent-mediated intervention, Salud y ¿xito, with primary Spanish- as well as English-speaking Latino parents and youth. This intervention consists of parent education delivered through sets of audio-CDs to promote positive parenting practices, including monitoring, rule setting, communication, and support. In addition, Salud y ¿xito M s, an enhanced version of this parent-mediated approach, will be tested. This enhanced intervention integrates audio-CD parent education with a school-based parent involvement program, PALMS Tools for Latino Family Outreach. These tools facilitate the creation of welcoming environments that encourage parental involvement in their preteens' and young adolescents' academic success and future education planning. This is critical because Latinos experience the highest levels of school dropout and school failure, which are both consequences and risk factors for risky behaviors related to HIV/AIDS. Both intervention components have a common purpose: Promoting positive parenting practices known to foster resiliency and protect youth from risk. The specific aims are to: (1) Enroll and randomly assign 60 urban schools serving high proportions of Latino families to one of three conditions: (a) Salud y ¿xito multi-year parent education; (b) Salud y ¿xito M s parent education supplemented with PALMS; or a (c) comparison condition (health education print materials); (2) Enroll 1600 Latino families with youth from 6th grade classes in the study and conduct telephone parent surveys and youth classroom surveys at baseline; (3)Implement Salud y ¿xito intervention components at schools assigned to the intervention conditions; (4) Conduct youth surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions are effective in reducing risk behaviors and intentions and promoting school attachment and pro-social activities; (5) Conduct parent surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions promote and sustain positive parenting practices; (6) Examine how parenting practices and youth outcomes vary by individual and family characteristics, including gender as well as acculturation; and (7) Examine whether youth outcomes are explained by parenting practices and identify which parenting practices mediate the relationship between experimental condition and youth outcomes.

"COLUMBIA CENTER FOR HEALTH OF URBAN MINORITIES (CHUM) This proposal represents a continuation and further development of of our existing NCMHD P60 Center of  Excellence, the Columbia Center for the Health of Urban Minorities (CHUM). Building on the successful  efforts of CHUM's first three years, we propose to develop CHUM into a multidisciplinary center of  excellence tightly focused on research in the NCMHD priority areas of cardiovascular disease and diabetes.  We plan to conduct three research projects aimed at generating new knowledge for improving minority  health among Carribean Latinos. The first project is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in poorly controlled  Latino diabetics to examine the effectiveness of a community based Community Health Worker intervention  at improving glycemic control and includes blood pressure and cholesterol as secondary outcomes. The  second project is a prospective study examining the long-term consequences of poor glycemic control on  cognitive function among diabetics. The third project, also an RCT, will evaluate the effectiveness of a  community-based comprehensive therapeutic lifestyle intervention that includes group sessions and  motivational interviewing on blood pressure control. The proposal includes an adminstrative and research  core providing the requisite administrative, methodological, statistical and data management infrastructure to  carry out these three thematically linked research projects. All three projects will be conducted in our local  community and the Planning Council established in the 1st phase of CHUM will continue to serve as the  formal venue for community input into the overall direction, shape and execution of the CHUM project.  Further, both RCTs build on the community partnerships established by CHUM's Community core and  include community based organizations as integral members of the research. Lastly, through CHUM's  established partnerships and successful efforts at obtaining support from other sources, CHUM will continue  to provide training opportunities for junior faculty, post-doctoral trainees, fellows and undergraduate students. Diabetes and heart disease are major health problems in the Hispanic community.  One research project will examine consequences of poorly controlled diabetes on memory, and two will  examine innovative community based interventions to better control these diseases among

"Cancer Survivorship: Telling a Story through the Eyes of ""Esperanza"" (HOPE)  appl This proposal will be building upon a prior positive collaborative working relationship between the community-based, minority serving institution, Padres Contra El Cancer [Parents against Cancer] (PADRES) and the Childhood Cancer Survivorship Program at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JOCC). The four years of the grant will establish infrastructure support required to sustain the ongoing research collaboration. PADRES and UCLA will synergy their efforts to better understand and address the needs of Latino childhood cancer survivors and their families. The objectives for the overall research strategy include: (1) formalize the infrastructure of the community-academic research partnership between PADRES and the JCCC in order to understand how to best develop culturally-relevant survivorship educational interventions for the Latino pediatric, adolescent, and young adult survivorship community given their risk for late effects; (2) to test the effectiveness of this intervention developed through this collaborative research partnership and disseminate the significant findings nationally for the mutual benefits of both partners; (3) through the development of the formalized research infrastructure, leadership within the PADRES/JCCC partnership will be able provide education, training, and empowerment to its diverse groups of members regarding how to improve access to cancer survivorship care through the model of community-based participatory research and be a resource for guidance to other programs nationally. This partnership will bring together the expertise and experience of the Internal Advisory Committee and Community Advisory Board to develop a culturally-relevant survivorship educational intervention during the implementation stage. The intervention will be tested for its acceptability and feasibility for delivery in the community setting. The expected outcome of this study is to develop the intervention in the form of a photonovela which can then be tested nationally in the Latino survivor community for its effectiveness to decrease stigma and improve families' survivorship care discussions and knowledge about the importance of survivorship care planning. This partnership will address health disparities highlighted in the Institute of Medicine's report on Childhood Cancer Survivorship: Improving Care and Quality of Life, President's Cancer Panel 2010 meeting, and Healthy People's 2010 objectives. Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for early morbidity and mortality due to previous cancer treatment. Cancer stigma among Latino families affected by cancer coupled with the knowledge gap regarding the need for survivorship-focused care may widen the existing health disparities for the Latino population.","Cancer Survivorship: Telling a Story through the Eyes of ""Esperanza"" (HOPE)  appl",8324483,P20CA157064,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Parents ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Siblings ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Survivors ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pediatric neoplasm/cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Stigmata ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' meetings ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' CCSS ', ' Childhood Cancer Survivor Study ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' pediatric cancer survivor ', ' childhood cancer survivor ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' chemotherapy ', ' community based participatory research ', ' community setting ', ' ']",NCI,PARENTS AGAINST CANCER,P20,2012,130972,0.052588349208115545
"Reducing Cancer Disparaties Among Latinos in Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Texas regional Community Networks Program, Latinos Contra El Cancer, combines innovative research, extensive community outreach, and a multi-faceted training program, all conducted within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) context, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in Latinos, and to build a cadre of competitive health disparities researchers trained in CBPR in three regions of Texas (Houston, El Paso, the Lower Rio Grande Valley). This will be accomplished through the work of three distinct yet complementary cores (Outreach, Research, and Training) to integrate knowledge generation, community health education, and community and researcher capacity building within and across the three sites, building on existing research infrastructures, longstanding relationships, and novel communication systems. The overarching goals of each Core are described below.  The goal of the proposed Outreach Program is to increase the use of evidence-based biomedical and behavioral procedures and interventions to reduce the cancer burden among Latinos in Texas. We will build on existing community partnerships, infrastructure, and programs to develop an Outreach Program that will accomplish this goal through capacity building with community partners and direct health promotion in Latino communities.  The goal of the Research Core - Intervention Study is to develop and evaluate an innovative intervention approach for reducing cancer risk related to the three leading behavioral risk factors for cancer: smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity. The project will focus on participants in a longitudinal study of cancer risk factors among Mexican Americans in Houston (Mexican American Cohort Study).  The goal of the Research Core - Pilot Study is to utilize quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the socio-demographic, acculturation, and psychosocial factors that influence Mexican Americans willingness to provide biologic specimens for biobanking.

"Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) that will focus on reducing cardiovascular disease risk among Latinos in East Los Angeles, California (East L.A.). East L.A. is an urban community with high rates of obesity-related chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke. East L.A. is over 96% Latino; 85% of whom have Mexican ancestry and the rest come mainly from Central America. Our primary objective is to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in this under-served area. To accomplish this objective, we have three integrated, complementary projects, two cores, and a Training and Career Development Program. We will use a community-based participatory approach to implement family and neighborhood environment interventions, along with the collection of physiological data that will examine risk in individuals and across generations. The intervention components include several dimensions that affect health outcomes - personal & family factors, systems factors, and environmental factors. Project 1 is an intensive home environment intervention involving families, of which one member is a high-risk case newly enrolled in a local diabetes care clinic. Project 2 will examine vascular function and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers for individuals varying in generational and immigrant status, to increase the understanding of the basis for the Latino acculturation paradox in CVD risk. Project 3 will conduct make overs of comer stores to enable them to market and provide healthier food options, as well as enable them to serve as a venue for training community members about healthier food options and meal preparation strategies. The center will also capitalize on the inclusion of both promotoras and public health rookies in intervention activities. The public health rookies will be adolescents recruited from a public high school in the community. The two cores provide administrative and research methods resources to the projects, and the Training and Career Development Program will provide resources and infrastructure to provide a pipeline for the public health rookies and will train and mentor graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty on the use of interdisciplinary, disparities-reduction research.          ",Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.,8296601,P50HL105188,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Affect ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Central America ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Biochemical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Immigrant ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' data management ', ' field study ', ' high school ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' food preparation ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' environmental intervention ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' operation ', ' doctoral student ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2012,2488888,0.007238358968120095
"Health Communication & Health Literacy to Improve Care for Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes disparities are common for Latino patients. Effective health communication can potentially narrow these disparities. This proposal details a career development plan that will prepare the principal investigator (PI) for success as an independent investigator with expertise in diabetes-related outcomes, health communication, and delivery of behavioral interventions for Latino diabetes patients. As an Internal Medicine- Pediatrics physician, with training in clinical investigation, the PI will gain new skills through this K23 in the areas of health disparities specific to diabetes care, enhanced Latino cultural competency, audio taping clinical encounters to assess the quality and role of health communication, and the development of a new training program for medical interpreters. The PI's immediate goals are to rigorously examine the quality of health communication between Latino diabetes patients, providers, and Spanish interpreters and the association between health communication and various diabetes-related health outcomes. To meet this goal, the PI has proposed a rigorous career development plan that incorporates additional didactic course work, regular participation in local and national meetings/seminars, a mentored research experience, and active involvement in an extremely supportive research environment. This includes an NIDDK funded Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC), NCRR-funded Meharry Clinical and Translational Research Center (MeTRC), Vanderbilt Program on Effective Health Communication (EHC), and an RCMI-funded Bioinformatics Core. The research specific aims are to: 1) conduct a cross-sectional, descriptive mixed-methods analysis of the quality of health communication between providers and Latino diabetes patients with particular emphasis on the role of the Spanish medical interpreter during language discordant encounters, and explore the association between baseline quality of health communication and various diabetes related health outcomes, 2) conduct an observational cohort study to examine the independent effect of provider health communication training and the use of a Spanish, literacy-sensitive educational toolkit on the quality of health communication during medical encounters, and assess the association between changes in the quality of health communication at 12 months with changes in diabetes related health outcomes, and 3) develop and pilot in a small RCT, an enhanced training program for Spanish medical interpreters geared toward improving their ability to work with providers and patients with LEP and limited health literacy during language discordant encounters. Overall, this K23 program will provide important insights into the nature of health communication with Latinos, the role of Spanish interpreters in this process, and most importantly prepare the PI for independent investigation of the role of effective health communication in addressing disparities in care for Latinos with diabetes.     Effective health communication can potentially improve diabetes care and clinical outcomes for Latino patients. This K23 award will allow the PI to gain expertise in the evaluation of the quality of health communication during clinical encounters between Latino patients, providers, and Spanish medical interpreters and in the delivery of effective behavioral diabetes interventions.

"ENLACE: A Promotora-Led Physical Activity Intervention Trial for Latinas in Texas     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Latinos experience a disproportionate burden of hypokinetic-related chronic diseases, threatening the future health of the nation's fastest-growing population. Physical inactivity has been linked to increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. Latinos are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to fail to meet physical activity (PA) recommendations, and Latino women are less physically active than Latino men. The goal of the proposed ENLACE research project is to design, implement and evaluate a promotora-led PA intervention that takes a comprehensive, multi- level, community-based approach to promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among a particularly underserved segment of Latinas. The intervention approach, based on the social ecological model, focuses on individual attitudes and skills, socio-cultural factors and environmental influences to behavior change. The proposed group- randomized controlled trial builds on formative and pilot research (funded by a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute R21, HL087765) by a team of academic investigators and community partners with extensive experience working together to conduct behavioral interventions and outreach with Latino and disadvantaged populations. Eight community resource centers (CRCs) in four predominantly Latino counties in South Texas' Lower Rio Grande Valley will be randomly assigned to either the Enlace PA Intervention (4 CRCs) or an attention-control condition (4 CRCs). We will recruit 704 Latinas ages 18-64 who do not meet national PA guidelines from colonias (unincorporated, impoverished, underserved Latino settlements) in the CRC service areas. Participants from CRCs randomized to the Enlace PA Intervention (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions followed by 24 weeks of a maintenance intervention (monthly promotora-delivered newsletters and telephone counseling). The group sessions' behavioral goal is for Latinas to engage in 30 minutes per day of MVPA on 5 or more days per week. The attention- control group (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions on home safety/first aid and monthly generic health education materials and informational telephone calls during the maintenance intervention period. The primary outcome is minutes per week of MVPA (measured with accelerometers). Secondary outcomes are physical fitness and weight maintenance. We also will evaluate self-efficacy, social support, decisional balance, and collective efficacy as mediators of MVPA changes. Standardized measurement of primary and secondary outcomes will occur at baseline, immediate (16 weeks) and delayed post-intervention (40 weeks). We hypothesize that Latinas in the ENLACE PA Intervention will significantly increase their MVPA levels as a result of addressing their specific individual, socio-cultural and environmental barriers and enhancing their social support and collective efficacy, compared to attention-control Latinas.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Increasing Latinas' ability to gain the benefits of regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is a key strategy for addressing Latino health disparities. Enlace was developed in partnership with community members, to enhance Latina's behavioral skills, promote social support and collective efficacy, and enhance access to culturally appropriate, economical PA resources in their communities. Research results will provide scientific knowledge about effective community-based intervention methods with potential for replication in underserved areas across the nation and will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of community-wide participation in research to bolster efforts to eliminate health disparities.              Increasing Latinas' ability to gain the benefits of regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is a key strategy for addressing Latino health disparities.

"Johns Hopkins Healthy Eyes Translational Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this cooperative agreement is to assess and evaluate system level and individual level factors that impact access to eye care; and to identify barriers and enablers to the delivery of eye care conforming to best practices that prevent vision loss and promote eye health. The Johns Hopkins Translational Research Center (TRC) will analyze multiple existing databases to develop a knowledge base for a public health interventions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities and improving the eye health of underserved populations in the United States. Specifically, we will focus on focus on cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Finally, we propose a collaborative study that uses this knowledge for implementation at the city level. The first set of analyses will focus on personal and perceived system barriers associated with the uptake of eyecare services in three previously studied populations: African Americans and Caucasians from the Salisbury Eye Evaluation (SEE) study and Latinos living in Arizona (studied as part of Proyecto Ver) and Latinos living in Baltimore (evaluated in the ProVision study funded by the NIH). The barriers and enablers of obtaining cataract surgical services will be assessed in all three racial/ethnic groups, whereas factors related to screening for diabetic retinopathy will be addressed using the two Latino populations, supplemented with analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Finally, the rates of glaucoma screening provided using the Medicare screening benefit as well as the rates and patterns of treatment of glaucoma will be assessed using data from Medicare. Additionally, NHANES has both visual field and optic nerve imaging and these data will be used to determine associations with having been diagnosed with glaucoma when it is present in order to identify groups at high risk for underdiagnosis. The proposed TRC network combined project will consist of establishing diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening surveillance systems in collaboration with city governments to be able to monitor patterns of care, especially among at risk underserved populations. An intervention will be tested to increase DR screening rates based on the findings of the analyses described above. Finally, a pre/post assessment will be made to see if the intervention might be expanded nationally.              Project Narrative This study is highly relevant to the public health. Findings from this research will inform policy planners and insurance administrators of key barriers and enablers associated with the major blinding eye conditions faced by minority populations in the United States.

"Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino population has experienced a dramatic increase over the past decade, making it the largest minority group in the United States (US). Along with this surge in numbers Latinos also face greater challenges in accessing health care compared to the general population. These health disparities, which are particularly salient among Latina women, make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors that affect the disproportionate numbers of people suffering from HIV/AIDS and substance abuse in this population. Our long term goal is therefore to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventual elimination of HIV/AIDS and substance abuse health disparities among Latinos. The proposed Center will expand on the activities of our current P-20 NIMHD C-SALUD located at Florida International University (FlU). C-SALUD will focus its research, training, and community collaboration activities with Latinos in Miami-Dade County, a county that not only houses a high concentration of Latinos but also has the dubious distinction of having one of the highest rates of HIV, cocaine related deaths, and emergency room admissions in the U.S. The proposed continuing C-SALUD will build on ongoing collaborations with community based organizations which have a longstanding history of providing health and social services to Latinos at risk for HIV and substance abuse as well as other underserved Latino populations in South Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: Administrative, Research, Research Education /Training, and Community Partnership/Engagement. The target population will be Latinos, particularly Latina women residing in Miami-Dade County with a focus on Latina farm workers ages 18 and older and recent Latina immigrants who have lived in the U.S. less than one year, ages 18-23. These two Latino subgroups are at high risk for HIV and have been impacted by the HIV epidemic. We anticipate that partnerships between C-SALUD researchers and the Miami-Dade County Latino community, will lead to the development of new collaborative strategies for researchers, CBOs, and the Latino community at large to work together more effectively in reducing and eliminating HIV and substance abuse health disparities among Latinos.             The Center is expected to enhance our understanding of the role that social and cultural determinants of health have on the substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors of Latinos, particular Latinas.

"Implementing the Health for All Model with Latino Community of Kansas City    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Due to longstanding health disparities in multiple minority populations, there is a deep need for innovative strategies and models that change community conditions and promote health equity. The aim of this proposal is to implement the culturally and contextually-adapted Health for All model, a promising pilot-tested intervention to change community conditions to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes risk factors in the Latino community in Kansas City, Missouri and Kansas City, Kansas. Using community-based participatory research methods, the project will assure that community members are equal and essential partners in developing, implementing and evaluating interventions focused on reducing health disparities. This project builds on the long-term relationship between the KU Work Group for Community Health and Development, at the University of Kansas, and the Kansas City - Chronic Disease Coalition. The community intervention will be comprised of several key components and elements, including: the creation of a clear vision and mission, logic model, and action plan adapted for the local Latino community; the assurance of intensive supports for the plan's implementation; the hiring of community mobilizers; documentation and review of activities for feedback and improvement; and shared responsibility among scientific and community partners for the project's development, implementation, and evaluation. Community-determined long-term objectives focus on related risk behaviors (e.g., increasing daily fruit and vegetable consumption, physical activity levels, cholesterol screen levels, and decreasing obesity). This will be achieved through the implementation of an action plan that puts in place new programs, policies and practices at the community and system levels that affect risk for CVD and diabetes in the Latino community and among organizations that serve Latinos. Data will be collected through ongoing documentation of all project-related activities and accomplishments facilitated by the coalition and its partners and annual surveys of self-reported behaviors among the targeted population. A panel design will be used with additional cross sectional samples for which pre-post comparisons will be conducted. The CBPR study will expand the science and practice of how communities create conditions that promote health and healthy equity.

"A Partnership Approach to Reducing HIV Disparities Among Latino Men DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Southeastern United States has the fastest growing Latino population in the country and carries a disproportionate HIV/AIDS disease burden. We propose a 5-year study (R24) to fully implement and rigorously evaluate a piloted lay health advisor (LHA) intervention designed to reduce risk of HIV infection among recently arrived, monolingual, less-acculturated Latino men who are settling in the Southeast. The intervention is based on social cognitive theory and the theory of empowerment education and was developed using community-based participatory research (CBPR). This study is a result of a long-term community-university partnership that has used and will continue to use CBPR throughout all phases of the research process.    A total of 20 Latino soccer teams in rural NC will be randomized to an LHA-led HIV prevention intervention or a delayed-intervention comparison group. One man from each of the intervention teams (n=10) will be nominated by his teammates and selected as an LHA in Year 2. The delayed-intervention teams (n=10) will receive the same intervention in Year 3. Quantitative assessment data will be collected from each LHA and 12 of his teammates from each of the 20 teams at: (1) baseline, (2) immediate postintervention, and (3) 12-month follow-up.    Participants in the HIV prevention intervention, relative to their peers in the delayed-intervention comparison group, are anticipated to demonstrate (1) increased self-reported use of condoms during sexual intercourse and (2) increased self-reported utilization of HIV and sexually transmitted disease (STD) counseling, testing, and treatment services.    To further evaluate and explore the intervention, qualitative data will be collected using individual in-depth interviews with LHAs and their teammates. We also will evaluate the CBPR process, using direct observation of partnership meetings, in-depth interviews with partners, and partnership document review.    Products from this study will include (1) a Spanish-language intervention that is ready for dissemination and adaptation, culturally relevant and gender-specific, and designed to reduce HIV risk among recently arrived, less-acculturated Latino men; (2) a deeper understanding of HIV risk and intervention among Latino men that will be reported through briefs, newspaper articles, local and national presentations, and manuscripts; and (3) insight into a research partnership process that includes lay community members, Latino soccer leagues and teams, AIDS service organizations, community-based organizations, 3 universities, and a broad spectrum of other partners.

"Community-Based Prevention of Youth Violence in Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent violence is an important public health problem in the US, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Latinos are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group of children in the US, and are disproportionately affected by youth violence. There is, however, little information on the risk and protective factors that influence Latino youth violence. The overall objective of this proposed NICHD Career Development Award research is to identify risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration. This will be accomplished through three specific aims, which are to: 1) Identify beliefs, attitudes, and norms that influence violence perpetration among Latino adolescents; 2) Identify risk and protective factors in the family, peer, and community contexts that predict violence perpetration in a cohort of Latino youth; and 3) Validate and examine the relative contributions of individual, family, peer, and community factors to violence among Latino adolescents. In Aim 1, focus groups of violent and non-violent Latino adolescents will be conducted to examine risk and protective factors for violence, violence prevention strategies, and components of potentially effective violence prevention interventions. For Aim 2, a secondary data analysis of the National Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) will be conducted using multi-level modeling techniques to determine which contextual factors in adolescence are associated with violence perpetration approximately two years later. The findings from Aims 1 and 2 will be used in Aim 3 to design a survey that concurrently examines individual and contextual factors associated with youth violence, and to test the survey in a large sample of Latino adolescents. Findings from these three studies will provide the foundation for a future Latino youth violence prevention intervention that is culturally tailored, focuses on the major risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence, and is informed by Latino youth. This innovative approach uses multiple methods (qualitative, multi-level longitudinal quantitative, and a survey) to address a significant public health need for improving the knowledge base required to develop successful community-based interventions for Latino youth violence prevention. The proposed award is consistent with the component of the NICHD mission to ensure that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability. The exceptional resources and institutional support at UT Southwestern, outstanding multi-disciplinary mentorship team, and the proposed career development activities, will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and nationally recognized expert on community-based interventions effective in reducing and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There is an epidemic of youth violence in the US, with 36% of adolescents involved in fighting and 18% in weapon-carrying, and Latinos are disproportionately affected by violence; because youth violence can result in serious injury and homicide, there is an urgent need to identify strategies that can lead to successful violence prevention interventions for Latino youth. The proposed research identifies risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration using focus groups with Latino youth, multi-level modeling of a longitudinal dataset, and a newly-designed survey administered to Latino youth. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence, as the proposed research studies could lead to the development of an effective youth violence prevention intervention for Latinos.            There is an epidemic of youth violence in the US, with 36% of adolescents involved in fighting and 18% in weapon-carrying, and Latinos are disproportionately affected by violence; because youth violence can result in serious injury and homicide, there is an urgent need to identify strategies that can lead to successful violence prevention interventions for Latino youth.

"Kansas Communities Cancer Disparties Network (KCCDN) Revision    PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): American Indians (Al) and Latinos suffer some of the greatest cancer-related health disparities in the US and are some of the least likely to participate in medical research. Barriers to participation include mistrust ofthe medical system, limited access to care, and limited culturally- and linguistically-appropriate resources. The Kansas Communities Cancer Disparities Network (KCCDN) was created in 2011 through a U54 Specialized Center-Cooperative Agreement to study and address cancer-related health disparities faced by rural American Indians and Latino communities. The current proposal, for a KCCDN Bioethics Policy Subcore (BPS), will capitalize on KCCDN's infrastructure and community connectedness. Long before KCCDN existed, researchers at KUMC were using community based participatory research (CBPR) methods to work with the Al and Latino communities to address pressing health concerns. Bioethics and biospecimen collection are issues that have come up repeatedly in community discussions. We propose the following specific aims: (1) To create a Bioethics Policy Subcore in the KCCDN Methods Core to develop, evaluate and disseminate future trainings, education and policies surrounding the informed consent process for biospecimen collection, use and disposal in both a clinical and research setting; and (2) To expand our current Community Health Worker Training to include how to respond to participant concerns regarding collection, use and disposal of biospecimens in both clinical and research settings. The BPS will employ CBPR to gather information about community members' current knowledge surrounding biospecimens collection and uses; collect information on what community members want to see in educational materials about the informed consent process for biospecimen uses; create and evaluate web-based and print materials to educate the communities on these issues; educate researchers and practitioners about ethical implications of collection biospecimens for future uses; and develop and disseminate policies for the informed consent process for biospecimen collection and use in these communities.  RELEVANCE (See instructions):  The Bioethics Policy Subcore for KCCDN develops and disseminates policies to guide practitioners on the issues of voluntary informed consent with regards to the collection use and disposal of biospecimens for clinical and research purposes among the American Indian and Latino communities in rural Kansas and surrounding areas. Better understanding of the communities' thoughts and perceptions about biospecimen  collection, uses and disposal will help us effectively develop these policies and guidelines.",Kansas Communities Cancer Disparties Network (KCCDN) Revision,8475998,U54CA154253,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2012,50000,0.04848276826703817
"Community Health Worker Diabetes RCT for Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos experience a 50-100% higher burden of illness and mortality due to diabetes than White Americans. Diabetes, if inadequately controlled, produces major social and economic costs for affected families and the larger community. While there is recent evidence of success for diabetes lifestyle interventions, there is a need for new and creative approaches that maintain the intensity of these interventions and at the same time meet the needs of under-resourced racial/ethnic communities. Community health worker (CHW) interventions have shown great promise, particularly among poor communities of color, but there is a need to evaluate these interventions for their effectiveness and potential cost-savings. The overall aim of this community-based randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) is to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of a CHW-led intervention designed to promote diabetes self-management and other healthy behaviors, compared to an enhanced usual- care (EUC) control group, among Latino residents of Detroit with physician-diagnosed type-2 diabetes. We will test the hypothesis that our CHW intervention led by trained Family Health Advocates (FHA) will increase knowledge of diabetes, increase physical activity, healthy dietary practices, improve diabetes self- management, and decrease HbA1c among Latino participants with diabetes. We propose to randomly assign 260 participants to either the FHA or EUC group. Participants assigned to the EUC group will receive invitations to community activities that are free and open to the public, including a general diabetes education class, physical activity classes, and healthy eating activities. The FHA group also will receive these invitations and the additional services of FHAs, who assist participants through a four-step, empowerment behavior change model and five-session diabetes education curriculum. FHAs also provide support services, including one-on-one education, accompanying clients on clinic visits, and linking clients to needed health care and other resources. Additionally, we hypothesize that the FHA group participants will have improved levels of patient activation compared to the EUC control group, as measured by health service utilization, completion of recommended tests, self-efficacy, and patient-provider communication. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of community health worker services that contribute to achievement of behavioral and clinical outcomes versus the EUC control group is hypothesized. This intervention will be implemented in collaboration with REACH Detroit, an existing partnership between university and community organizations which aims to reduce racial and ethnic disparities by preventing diabetes and its complications. The REACH Detroit and its collaborators have a successful record of community-based participatory intervention research.    PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research aims to demonstrate how a culturally tailored community health worker intervention can be a cost-effective method for assisting Latinos with diabetes to improve their self-management skills and health status. If successful, the methods and results of this research will assist communities and health providers and systems to include community health worker services within their systems of care. Ultimately, we believe such interventions hold one key to eliminating disparities in diabetes care and diabetes complications.

The Center's mission is to reduce disparities related to cognitive health and healthcare in Latinos through a well-integrated, interdisciplinary, and inter-professional mentoring program that will diversity the research workforce. In addition, through the creation of a network of community agencies, healthcare leaders and regional academic institution, the Center will advance cognitive health and healthcare for Latinos in California's Central Valley who suffer dramatic health disparities. The Center's four Cores (Administrative, Investigator Development, Community Liaison, and Analysis) will work in an integrated and cohesive fashion to accomplish our aims. The overall specific aims of the application are to 1) enhance the capacity, size, and diversity of the research workforce and promote careers in minority aging research by strategic outreach, sustained mentoring, and pilot grants to RCMAR Scholars, 2) increase knowledge in cognitive health and impairment for older Latinos through interdisciplinary research and training in measurement, mechanisms, and interventions, 3) advance the science of recruitment and retention of older Latinos related to cognitive health and related healthcare services, and 4) improve health and reduce disparities for Latinos in California's central valley through community engagement, community-oriented research, and dissemination to older Latinos and their families and providers serving Latino communities. The proposed RCMAR will benefit from significant resources at UC Davis, including an NIH-funded Clinical Translational Science Center and Alzheimer's Disease Center.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The UC Davis RCMAR addresses an important public health problem (cognitive health and impairment) in a demographically significant and historically under-served population (Latinos) that suffers from compelling evidence of disparities.

"Social Capital and Children's Development: An Experimental Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will test the causal effects of social capital on levels and inequalities of children's social and cognitive development during the early elementary years. Social capital here refers to trust and shared expectations embedded in social networks of parents, teachers, and children. For young children, social capital operates primarily through their relationships with their parents, enhancing development through mechanisms of social support and social control. Children from low-income Latino families are a special focus of the study. The research design is experimental: social capital will be manipulated through a well-tested intervention Families and Schools Together (FAST) that will enhance the social capital among parents, teachers, and children through an intensive after-school program and a 2-year follow-up program. The study will include 52 schools in Milwaukee and San Antonio (about 208 teachers and 3,120 first graders and their families), with half the schools randomly selected for the intervention and half serving as controls. The experimental design will permit a strong test of the causal role of social capital. The project will also involve an implementation study intended to illuminate the processes by which social capital is generated and affects child development. The proposed research is interdisciplinary, drawing on sociology, psychology, and economics,and it reflects an ecological perspective that crosses boundaries between families and schools. The study thus responds to the call for research on the Science and Ecology of Early Development. Key aspects of child development will be assessed, including (a) social skills and problem behavior from standardized behavioral ratings by parents; (b) the latter plus academic competence as rated by teachers; and (c) grade retention, attendance rates, and third-grade reading and mathematics scores from school records. Social capital will be measured with repeated surveys of teachers and parents that address the extent of social networks, parent involvement, trust, and shared expectations among parents, between parents and schools, and between parents and children. Data will be analyzed with multilevel statistical models that take account of variation at the individual and school levels of analysis.RELEVANCE. Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, and among the most disadvantaged. Latino families often perceive a sense of distance from the school system, which can create barriers to their children's academic and social development, important dimensions of public health. This study will yield practical as well as scientific insights into the value of increased social capital for development of children among a variety of demographic groups, and particularly those from low-income Latino families.

"Improving Latino Health Literacy: An Intergenerational Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this FAST TRACK SBIR is to develop and evaluate a culturally relevant health literacy- training program for Latinos to improve the knowledge and skills to protect health and prevent disease. This program is tentatively entitled Entre Nuestra Familias/Among Our Latino Families (ENF). Drawing from traditional Hispanic values, the ENF Program provides an intergenerational approach to health education, offering multiple members of the family simultaneous training in key health literacy skills and information on cross-cutting health topics to reinforce healthy behaviors within families and communities. This training program will be offered through community-based organizations to reduce institutional barriers to care that are often experienced by Latinos. The U.S. Census reported in 2007 that there are45.5 million Hispanics living in the U.S. Not only do Latinos constitute the fastest growing minority group in the country, but they also face significant health challenges. Indeed, Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and there is evidence that the health disparities experienced by Latinos may be linked to significant barriers to health care, including low rates of health insurance, low English proficiency, lack of accurate and culturally relevant health information, a dearth of culturally competent health facilities and information, fear and mistrust of the U.S. Medical system. Because of these disparities and their resulting impact on health, there have been strong calls to develop culturally appropriate public health initiatives to improve the health of Latinos in the U.S. To that end, KDH Research & Communication will develop the ENF Program. In Phase I, KDHRC will develop the print portions of the training program, and conduct a pilot evaluation of the product's effectiveness, in collaboration with Dia de la Mujer Latino, a health advocacy group that serves Latinos. In Phase II, we will expand the training program to include video elements for the participants and multimedia aspects for the facilitator. Then, we will implement and evaluate the training program at multiple sites to examine the program's effectiveness and the extent to which different social factors (poverty, education, country of origin, geographic location) best predict efficacy of the program, using a quasi- experimental pre-test, post-test evaluation design. Following product completion and evaluation, the ENF program will be disseminated to community-based organizations nationwide. The results of the evaluation will be disseminated through the academic literature and practice and policy briefs to add to scientific knowledge about best practices for reducing health disparities in Latino communities. Further, we will conduct town hall meetings in our target communities to disseminate results of the evaluation to those most affected by the research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hispanics bear a higher burden of disease than non-Hispanic whites in almost every category of risk, and as a result, there have been strong calls for the public health community to develop culturally appropriate interventions to reduce health disparities. This proposal is to develop an intergenerational health literacy training program that incorporates key aspects of Latino culture to engage and retain participants. The program will be delivered through community based nonprofit and faith-based organizations to reduce barriers to care. After the development and evaluation of this product, the training program will be disseminated nationwide to provide the public health field with an effective and innovative tool to reduce health

"End-of-life treatment preferences of Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End of Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Principal Investigator: Isabel Torres, Dr.P.H. The overall goal of the NCI K01 career development plan is to provide the candidate with a program of mentored research activity and study in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and outcomes research to launch an independent research career with specialization in the integration of these research areas. The five-year plan is carefully designed to 1) obtain further research experience in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and health services research; 2) advance skills related to the design and analyses of prospective palliative care studies through training in advanced statistical methods; 3) improve skills needed to develop and test new instruments and performance measures to improve the accuracy of assessing quality outcomes for both English and Spanish speaking Latinos with cancer; 4) acquire further grant writing skills and experiences, resulting in the submission of an R01 grant before the end of the support period. Properly identifying the end-of-life preferences of cancer patients is a national healthcare priority and understanding the clinical, cultural, psychosocial and system-level factors that influence these decisions is paramount for clinicians and policymakers trying to respect patient preferences and improve their quality of care. The aim of the study is to determine if declining health status influences the end-of-life treatment preferences in Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and how these preferences are modified by factors such as acculturation, health literacy, medical mistrust, provider ethnicity or the use of interpreters, or patient navigators. Participants will be 100 older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, stage III or greater, and 100 contemporaries without cancer. Persons without cancer will be surveyed only once cross-sectionally and those with cancer will be interviewed at baseline and then monthly until twelve months or death to capture the preferences of both those who are undergoing rapid decline and those who are stable. Understanding the relationship between declining functional status and the treatment preferences of older Latinos with cancer has important clinical and policy implications, as findings could influence the use of written documents for advance care planning and inform the content and frequency of discussions that may be needed to capture changes in preferences triggered by changes in health status. We expect the proposed area of study and research that integrates palliative cancer care and health disparities research and applies prospective analytic methods to investigate a critical and understudied area to make a significant contribution to cancer care research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: End-of-Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the older population and new Latino cancer cases are predicted to double within the next twenty years. A person with cancer's choices to forgo life-extending treatment may change over time and as their health declines, yet identifying their choices related to one of life's most difficult periods is not always easy. This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients, influence their end-of-life treatment choices.

"Cultural Adaptation of a Supportive Care Needs Measure for Latino Cancer Survivor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To date there is a paucity of research and information on Latino male cancer survivors, who are part of the largest and fastest growing racial/ethnic minority group in the United States. Considering the long term treatment related side effects that deeply affect quality of life, and that Latinos are being diagnosed at younger ages, it is critical that we develop a better understanding of the supportive care needs of this at-risk population. Currently, there are few available data that provide information with regard to supportive care needs for developing and or adapting relevant interventions for Latino cancer male survivors. While several English- language instruments have been developed to assess supportive care needs of cancer survivors, such as the Cancer Survivor Unmet Needs measure (CaSUN), none have been culturally adapted for or validated among Latino Spanish speaking survivors. Guided by an ""emic-etic paradigm,"" this study will use an exploratory mixed method study design, which employs a series of iterative and group consensus-building approaches. A three phase iterative approach will be used to translate and adapt the CaSUN using the Cultural Equivalency Model for Translating and Adapting Instruments. This process also emphasized the use of conceptual, content semantic and technical equivalence techniques through all phases of the study. The specific aims are to 1) use qualitative methods to explore the supportive care needs of Latino male cancer survivors to inform the cultural adaption of the CaSUN, 2) adapt the Spanish language CaSUN using systematic and iterative methods, and 3) pilot test and provide initial evidence of validity and reliability of the translated and culturally adapted measure for Latino male cancer survivors. It is expected that study findings will inform an evidence-based approach for the cross-cultural adaptation of validated measures and add to the sparse literature on cancer survivorship among Latino men. Findings are expected to contribute to the existing science of cancer-related health disparities by providing a more in-depth understanding of the supportive care needs of Latino male cancer survivors, a rapidly growing group in the US. In terms of overall cancer survivorship significance, the study is expected to yield a measure that has had broad implications and application for future psych educational intervention that engage and support underserved cancer survivors in managing their illness and recovery.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Responding to the need to expand the development of instruments to describe and measure cancer survivor' recovery and to increase the ""knowledge base"" for the creation of interventions for underserved population, this R03 uses a series of systematic and iterative approaches to translate and culturally adapt a validated supportive care needs measure into Spanish for Latino cancer survivors.              Responding to the need to expand the development of instruments to describe and measure cancer survivor' recovery and to increase the ""knowledge base"" for the creation of interventions for underserved population, this R03 uses a series of systematic and iterative approaches to translate and culturally adapt a validated supportive care needs measure into Spanish for Latino cancer survivors.            ",Cultural Adaptation of a Supportive Care Needs Measure for Latino Cancer Survivor,8323752,R03CA168403,"['urinary bladder ', ' Bladder Urinary System ', ' Bladder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Age ', ' Affect ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Feedback ', ' Florida ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Minor ', ' Language ', ' Interview ', ' male ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Methods ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Incidence ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung ', ' Literature ', ' survivorship ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Semantics ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' gastric ', ' Stomach ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Phase ', ' Latino ', ' Comprehension ', ' Measures ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Translating ', ' Testing ', ' American ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Community Networks ', ' Staging ', ' instrument ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' English Language ', ' Techniques ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Procedures ', ' European ', ' Series ', ' Survivors ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' social ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' meetings ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' member ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Process ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Cognitive ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Modification ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Address ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Data ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment effect ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' cancer statistics ', ' psychoeducational intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R03,2012,65033,0.06877788134228822
"Increasing the Pipeline: Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to increase the proportion of Latinos in cancer control research, particularly in the Southwestern U.S., by establishing a Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research (LTPCCR) that will motivate Latino master's-level students and health professionals to complete doctoral programs and careers as cancer control researchers. The LTPCCR is modeled after an evidence-based training model entitled, Minority Training Program in Cancer Control Research (MTPCCR) that targeted a spectrum of ethnic groups in California. Specifically, the LTPCCR will recruit an annual cohort of 20 Latino master's-level students or master's-trained health professionals. An innovation of the LTPCCR is that it targets a single ethnic minority - Latinos/Hispanics who will come from the Southwestern U.S. and Oklahoma. It will provide four interventions along the pipeline from masters-level to doctoral-level training, including: a) a Summer Institute for all participants, b) 9 annual paid summer internships in cancer disparities research (Y2-5), c) 3 annual Doctoral Application Support Awards and d) a Doctoral Student Retreat. Lastly, it will demonstrate an enrollment rate in doctoral programs that exceeds Latino enrollment achieved by the previous MTPCCR. We anticipate a minimum annual Latino enrollment of at least 15% (a 33% increase over that achieved by the MTPCCR). Additional we expect at least 50% of doctoral students reporting cancer control as their research focus and the majority of doctoral students indicating that the Texas program had a strong positive influence on these academic goals. Other benchmarks for success include a significant increase in self-efficacy and in participants' intention to apply to a doctoral program after attending the Summer Institute; and a minimum of 65% of participants rating each session as excellent.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite private and governmental support for programs that encourage Latinos to move through the pipeline from high school to college to research in basic sciences and medicine, there has been little investment in the social and behavioral sciences that send cancer control researchers out into communities to conduct epidemiologic, communication, and behavioral research. The goal of this program is to address these disparities by increasing the proportion of Latinos in cancer control research, particularly in the Southwestern U.S.           Despite private and governmental support for programs that encourage Latinos to move through the pipeline from high school to college to research in basic sciences and medicine, there has been little investment in the social and behavioral sciences that send cancer control researchers out into communities to conduct epidemiologic, communication, and behavioral research.

"Family Care of Older Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos age 65 or older have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and more severe complications from the disease, compared to non-Latino Whites. Latino elders' consequent risks for functional impairment and permanent disability raise questions about their family environment and the role caregivers play in helping them to manage the disease. Studying the family environment is important for addressing and eventually eliminating Latinos' health disparities arising from this chronic disease. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to provide mentored research and professional training to prepare me for a career as a federally-funded, independent investigator on health disparities and aging research in the area of family care of older Latinos. My immediate goals are to 1) develop a research program that characterizes the care of older adults within the Mexican-origin family; and 2) develop proficiency in culturally-relevant interventions for Latino elders and their caregivers. I propose to move my research beyond the female caregiver, toward a family level approach to elder care along one specific health dimension, management of type 2 diabetes. The K01 award builds directly on my current work by 1) including the perspectives of caregiving men and diabetic care-receiving elders; and 2) examining the process of family elder care through observation of caregiver-care receiver dyads (CG-CR dyad) in home settings. I propose three phases of research that culminate in developing and evaluating the feasibility of a CG-CR dyad intervention to improve care receiving Latino elders' diabetes outcomes. The training aspect of this award will provide me with in-depth knowledge in: 1) theory development and measurement of family care of Latino elders; 2) observational methods in home settings; and 3) intervention development and evaluation. My long-term objective is to establish a research trajectory based on theoretical and empirical principles that can be applied in real-world settings to improve the health outcomes of community-dwelling Latino elders. The interdisciplinary mentoring team I put together and my affiliations with the UCLA RCMAR and the UCLA School of Public Health provide the infrastructure to support these endeavors.       RELEVANCE: The proposed research focuses on older Latinos, the largest and second fastest aging sub-population in the United States. Many older Latinos have diabetes and suffer severe consequences from the disease, leading to poor health and disability. This research looks at the role of family caregivers in Latino elders' management of diabetes, one step toward finding ways to improve Latino elders' health in this area.

"Increasing Water Intake In Lieu of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages among Latino Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, ""Increasing Water Intake In Lieu of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages among Latino Youth,"" is a three-year proposal in response to PA-12-102 R13 Academic-Community Partnership Conference Series. The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance an existing academic-community partnership that will inform priorities for an intervention to increase intake of tap water in lieu of SSBs among Latino children and adolescents. Drinking water instead of SSBs can reduce children's total daily caloric intake thereby reducing obesity. This issue is of particular significance among Latino youth as they are more likely to drink SSBs and less likely to drink tap water than White and Asian children. To date, few interventions have focused on increasing water intake among children and there have been no interventions that have focused on increasing tap water intake among Latino children. For the past five years, researchers at the University Of California (CA) at San Francisco and the Atkins Center for Weight and Health at Berkeley in conjunction with nutrition advocates at the CA Food Policy Advocates have collaborated to improve drinking water access and intake in CA public schools. During a March 2012 convening, local, state, and national stakeholders prioritized a need for the development and evaluation of school-based interventions that promote intake of tap water instead of SSBs among populations most at risk for obesity. Support from this grant will allow us to build on this recent meeting and augment partnerships with community-based organizations from the CA Central Valley, an agricultural region with a large low-income, Latino population, to address disparities in beverage intake among Latino youth. Community-partnerships are essential to addressing such inequities. Specific activities for the academic-community partnership will include 1) bringing together a group of diverse stakeholders representing broad domains of research, policy, and community, 2) development of a memorandum of understanding to codify the partnership, 3) bimonthly meetings to clarify and delineate stakeholders' priorities for a school-based intervention focused on increasing tap water intake instead of SSBs among Latino children and adolescents, and 4) regular dissemination events to the broader community (i.e., national expert presentations, reports of local research study findings and board progress, case studies of innovative school practices, and methods workshops relevant to the community [e.g., drinking water testing, photovoice]). At the end of the three-year period, the academic-community partnership will produce the following products: development of an R01 application to examine the effect of a school-based intervention to promote tap water intake on obesity among Latino children and adolescents, submission of at least three peer-reviewed manuscripts, attainment of funded grant proposals, and introduction of relevant legislation.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) can reduce childhood obesity. Even though Latino youth are more likely to be obese and to drink SSBs than their non-Latino peers, there is very limited research in this area. Such investigation is critical in designing and implementing interventions and policies to encourage intake of water instead of sugary drinks among Latino children. This conference will help provide direction for research on this topic.              Drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) can reduce childhood obesity.

"De la Mano con la Salud (Lend A Hand for Helath): A Male Lay Health Advisor Netwo    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): De la Mano con la Salud (Lend a Hand for Health): a male lay health advisor network in a new growth community Latinos, the fastest growing population in the United States, experience barriers to quality health care and have worse health outcomes than Whites. Lack of social support puts men living apart from their families at additional risk for depression, substance abuse and STDs. The effectiveness of promotores (lay health advisors) has been documented in communities with high concentrations of Latinos. However, today 20% of all Latinos in the U.S. -10 million people- live in ""new growth communities"" (NGC), areas with low, yet growing, concentrations of Latinos, where Latinos represent fewer than 5% of the population. Latinos residing in NGC face more health care access barriers because there are few services that address their cultural and language needs and because they face more social isolation. There are no published health promotion efforts using promotores in NGC. Promotores are usually female; there is need for studying the effectiveness of male promotores. The Latino Engagement Group for Salud (LEGS) is a partnership of health and social service providers, grassroots community members and university researchers that has been integral in the preparation of this CBPR proposal. We propose to accomplish three aims. 1. Assess the effect of the CBPR-led male promotores network on increasing health care access and social support for men living apart from their families, as measured by a) obtaining a source of care for 40% of clients without a usual source of care at enrollment; b) achieving a well-health visit for 50% of clients who have not had a well-health visit in the last year; and c) increasing clients' social support from baseline to 3 months after enrollment in the promotores program. 2. Explore qualitatively the impact of the male promotores network on clients in an NGC. 3. Examine the effect of the network in empowering male promotores. Our project will be organized using six steps to conduct CBPR. The LEGS has identified men living apart from their families as a population with critical health service needs. We are currently conducting further needs assessment with focus groups, surveys and key-informant interviews. For this study, we will implement a male promotores network that will include 5 promotores and a super-promotor or coordinator. Promotores will conduct outreach to clients (n=125) and follow up using cell phones. We will use surveys, summary data from our clinical partners, and in-depth interviews with network clients and promotores to gather data for our specific aims. This research will answer critical questions in CBPR: Will a promotores network be effective in improving health care access and social support in an NGC? What are the experiences of clients and promotores in networks with male promotores? Can the CBPR process empower male promotores?      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Relevance This study will provide information to fill two gaps in health promotion information: how to reach a dispersed new growth Latino community, and what the dynamics of a male promotores network are. Ten million Latinos now reside in new growth communities; the potential to use these findings to guide new programs in a similar geographical setting is vast.

"Nuestro Futuro: Applied Science Education to Engage Black and Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is a curriculum based educational opportunity implemented in an after- school enrichment setting in a Boston, MA public middle school. The project builds on the active NIMHD funded research intervention study, Nuestro Futuro Saludable. This academic enrichment program is focused on inquiry-based science education, public outreach and community-based information campaigns to educate students, families, and their communities on health research topics within a health equity framework. The program is designed to (1) cultivate a deeper, contextualized understanding of scientific concepts among students related to health disparities and the social determinants of health in their community; (2) teach students to foster their ability to ""think"" like scientists from various disciplines (eg: epidemiology, sociology, biomedicine) as they study diseases that present disparities in their community (eg: asthma, diabetes, HIV/AIDS); and (3) provide an opportunity for students to use what they have learned about health, science, and disparities to develop and carry-out local advocacy and outreach efforts. The project is designed to increase the scientific literacy of Latino and Black students, as well as student interest in the sciences and enthusiasm for studying the sciences by providing research career awareness opportunities, mentoring and information dissemination to increase the representation of underrepresented minority groups in the sciences.        The US will have a majority-minority population by 2042, thus minority health will soon characterize the nation's health. Blacks and Latinos, health disparity populations that bear an unequal burden of preventable disease and disability, demonstrate poor academic achievement in the sciences. Alleviating health disparities requires similar progress in addressing disparities in K-12 education and, therefore, it is imperative to increase the number of these underrepresented minorities in the sciences, medicine, health, and research in order to increase the knowledge base and inform efforts to reduce and eliminate health disparities.

"Effective Care of Latinos with Diabetes and Limited English Proficiency    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to PA-09-262: NIDDK: Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases. Ineffective diabetes care impacts patient well-being, health outcomes, health care costs and contributes to racial and ethnic disparities. Latinos have high rates of diabetes and well-documented disparities in diabetes care and outcomes. Factors recognized as contributing to disparities in diabetes outcomes for Latinos include lack of health insurance, financial barriers to accessing treatments, and limited English proficiency. Latinos with limited English proficiency (LEP) now constitute 44% of Latino adults. Health care systems are struggling to provide clinical care to Latinos with LEP and diabetes using either bilingual clinicians or interpreter services. The comparative effectiveness of these language access strategies with respect to clinical outcomes is not known. In a prior study, in a setting with uniform access to care and professional medical interpreters, we found that Latino patients with LEP were less likely to have poor glycemic control if they identified their physician as fluent in Spanish. We now propose to build on our work by examining multiple clinical outcomes using richly detailed data from a 5-year longitudinal cohort of Latinos enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California-Diabetes Registry. The overarching goals of this proposal are: to determine whether language proficiency is a root cause of diabetes disparities among Latinos; provide essential information on the comparative effectiveness of two strategies to overcome language barriers (bilingual clinicians versus professional medical interpreters); deepen understanding of how language barriers influence patient and physician behavior (medication adherence and clinical inertia); and determine if there are aspects of interpreter use that can be modified to improve the outcomes of language discordant care. Our results will inform health systems and clinicians seeking to improve diabetes care for Latinos with LEP and will provide a framework for intervention studies to reduce disparities for this population.        Latinos are the largest minority population in the US and have high and rising prevalence of diabetes and diabetes complications. Disparities between Latinos and whites in diabetes outcomes appear to be increasing. Limited English proficiency (LEP), which currently affects 44% of Latino adults, may contribute to less effective health care, but the role of language barriers in diabetes care is unclear. This observational study will use data from an insured patient population to examine whether LEP status is associated with disparities in diabetes outcomes among Latinos, and compare the effectiveness of two strategies for overcoming language barriers (language concordant (Spanish-speaking) physicians versus professional interpreters) and reducing disparities. Our overarching goal is to improve the quality of healthcare for Latinos with diabetes.

"Preventing violence and racial disparities for Latino youth     DESCRIPTION: This project uses Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) to address health disparities related to violence exposure among Latino youth. An important objective of the proposal is to address a significant gap in prevention science and health disparities research, by forming an academic-community partnership focused on preventing youth violence and reducing the prevalence of subsequent problem outcomes associated with violence exposure that pose a significant public health burden for Latino youth. The specific aims are to: (1) build a strong community-academic partnership to assess community needs and priorities for violence prevention through effective collaboration, shared responsibility and equity in decision-making among researchers, community agencies, and key community stakeholders; (2) identify local conditions related to experiences of violence, acculturative stress, discrimination, and other related factors to document, and highlight the Latino community's view of its own health problems related to violence and its negative effect on children and adolescents; (3) jointly sponsor meetings that address local conditions in order to heighten the community's awareness of health disparities related to violence exposure, disseminate relevant violence prevention information that stems from current research findings using both national and local data; and (4) develop and submit collaborative proposals for a CBPR intervention project to reduce/prevent violence among Latino youth. To accomplish these aims, we will build upon and strengthen existing collaborations with academic, community-based organizations, and community members. The collaborative partners and community stakeholders have identified addressing youth violence as a high priority. We will develop an advisory board and engage them in CBPR training. We will collaboratively conduct extensive formative work, including qualitative interviews and focus groups with community stakeholders, to assess priorities and potential strategies for addressing youth violence prevention. We will engage youth using photovoice, a strength-based methodology using cameras to allow participants to take a central role in assessment of their lives and communities in a flexible and accessible manner, suitable across age groups, and for the purpose of critical dialogue and reflection, and ultimately, community organization towards social action. We will invite local and national experts to engage in a reciprocal exchange of knowledge with our advisory board and with the community-at-large, through community forums. We will assess the success of the partnership in terms of the collaborative process, efficiency, empowerment, and satisfaction, and seek additional funds for a CBPR intervention project focused on community-based youth violence prevention. The community-academic partnership and infrastructure developed during this process will allow us to continue to collaborate in addressing health disparities facing Latin youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Violence exposure poses a major problem for Latino youth in the United States. Violence exposure and its negative health and mental health sequelae represent a racial disparity, occurring at disproportionately higher rates among Latino youth when compared with their non-Hispanic White counterparts. An important objective of the proposal is to address a significant gap in prevention science and health disparities research, by forming an academic-community partnership focused on preventing youth violence and reducing the prevalence of subsequent problem outcomes associated with violence exposure that pose a significant public health burden for Latino youth.            ",Preventing violence and racial disparities for Latino youth,8572085,R13HD075495,"['Awareness ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R13,2013,29996,0.011510656574039095
"Reducing HIV Disparities among Latinos: Disseminating An Effective Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a 3-year study (R24) to facilitate dissemination, uptake, and sustainability of the HoMBReS: Por UN Cambio intervention, a lay health advisor (LHA) intervention found to be efficacious in reducing the HIV risk among immigrant Latino men in the Southeast. Informed by the lived experiences of immigrant Latino men, perspectives of organizational representatives, and social cognitive and empowerment theories, this intervention was developed and tested by a long-term community-university partnership that has used and will continue to use community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles throughout all phases of the research process. In the proposed study, 3 community-based organizations (CBOs) that represent typical community-level providers of HIV and STD prevention interventions (i.e., an AIDS service organization, a Latino-serving organization, and a county public health department) will work with our existing CBPR partnership to develop a comprehensive toolkit to guide implementation; implement and evaluate implementation; and disseminate results and materials through multiple channels. Each CBO will hire 1 part-time project coordinator to recruit, train, and support 8 lay health advisors (known as ""Navigates""). These 24 Navigates will promote sexual health among members of their soccer team-based social networks for 12 months. Baseline and follow-up data will be collected from social network members to evaluate impact. Blending both quantitative and qualitative methods, we will explore facilitators and barriers to intervention implementation, fidelity, and potential sustainability by these diverse CBOs. Pre and post-implementation, we will conduct individual in-depth interviews with CBO representatives. Post-implementation, we also will conduct focus groups with Navigates at each CBO. We will use scale-up and spread, a framework informed by diffusion and social normative theories, to guide this study. We also will evaluate the CBPR process, using in-depth interviews with partners, direct observation of partnership meetings and study implementation, and partnership document review.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will provide insights to the increasing number of CBOs in the South seeking to reduce HIV/STD-related health disparities among the growing population of immigrant Latinos; and aligns with the Affordable Care Act's emphasis on recruiting and training community health workers to connect marginalized populations with preventive health services.                ",Reducing HIV Disparities among Latinos: Disseminating An Effective Intervention,8564872,R24MD002774,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diffusion ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Life Experience ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Newsletter ', ' North Carolina ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' health care professional practice ', ' Professional Practice ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Soccer ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' ']",NIMHD,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R24,2013,469298,0.07113008118947985
"End-of-life treatment preferences of Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End of Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Principal Investigator: Isabel Torres, Dr.P.H. The overall goal of the NCI K01 career development plan is to provide the candidate with a program of mentored research activity and study in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and outcomes research to launch an independent research career with specialization in the integration of these research areas. The five-year plan is carefully designed to 1) obtain further research experience in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and health services research; 2) advance skills related to the design and analyses of prospective palliative care studies through training in advanced statistical methods; 3) improve skills needed to develop and test new instruments and performance measures to improve the accuracy of assessing quality outcomes for both English and Spanish speaking Latinos with cancer; 4) acquire further grant writing skills and experiences, resulting in the submission of an R01 grant before the end of the support period. Properly identifying the end-of-life preferences of cancer patients is a national healthcare priority and understanding the clinical, cultural, psychosocial and system-level factors that influence these decisions is paramount for clinicians and policymakers trying to respect patient preferences and improve their quality of care. The aim of the study is to determine if declining health status influences the end-of-life treatment preferences in Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and how these preferences are modified by factors such as acculturation, health literacy, medical mistrust, provider ethnicity or the use of interpreters, or patient navigators. Participants will be 100 older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, stage III or greater, and 100 contemporaries without cancer. Persons without cancer will be surveyed only once cross-sectionally and those with cancer will be interviewed at baseline and then monthly until twelve months or death to capture the preferences of both those who are undergoing rapid decline and those who are stable. Understanding the relationship between declining functional status and the treatment preferences of older Latinos with cancer has important clinical and policy implications, as findings could influence the use of written documents for advance care planning and inform the content and frequency of discussions that may be needed to capture changes in preferences triggered by changes in health status. We expect the proposed area of study and research that integrates palliative cancer care and health disparities research and applies prospective analytic methods to investigate a critical and understudied area to make a significant contribution to cancer care research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: End-of-Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the older population and new Latino cancer cases are predicted to double within the next twenty years. A person with cancer's choices to forgo life-extending treatment may change over time and as their health declines, yet identifying their choices related to one of life's most difficult periods is not always easy. This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients, influence their end-of-life treatment choices.

"A Randomized Clinical Trial Of Culturally Tailored MI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the priority area Treatment for Health Disparities/Special Populations. Epidemiological and psychosocial research indicates that Latinos suffer greater adverse effects from hazardous drinking compared to other racial/ethnic groups, including higher rates of cirrhosis fatality and alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes. Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer alcohol-related health disparities, are less likely to initiate and to remai in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with high density of alcohol outlets. However, research on the field is challenged by the lack of studies comparing tailored to non-tailored treatments. We have pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905) demonstrating that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers. This study will be the basis for the current proposed study, which is a larger scale version of the pilot. The key modification was to incorporate social stressors in the context of acculturation. Thus, in the proposed study, we will also explore acculturation stress as an influence on the relationship between acculturation and alcohol consumption behavior. The public health impact of this study will be to develop a program of early screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous drinking among Latinos in communities that may lack such services. By providing early screening and intervention, we hope to minimize the burden of illness and social consequences that disproportionately affect Latino communities. Study Design: 357 Latino men and women who meet criteria for hazardous drinking (> 5/occasion for men, >4/occasion for women) will be recruited from the community. Following informed consent, they will complete a baseline assessment in either Spanish or English, and will then be randomized to receive either un-tailored motivational intervention (MI) or a culturally-tailored motivational intervention (CTMI). Participant randomization will be balanced by language preference, gender, alcohol severity, acculturation stress, and negative consequences, to ensure there is equivalent representation in each cell. Participants will be contacted by research assistants unaware of treatment assignment at 2, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Primary Aim 1: It is hypothesized that those randomized to receive the tailored treatment will report fewer alcohol- related negative consequences and fewer heavy drinking days at follow-up vs. those randomized to receive the un-tailored treatment. Primary Aim 2: Explore acculturation stress as a moderator of alcohol treatment outcomes. Long term goals: Develop a model of care that is easily disseminated in the community, and to generate theoretically-informed hypotheses to better understand how acculturation stress and processes confer risk for increased drinking among Latinos. We expect that this project will contribute needed knowledge about the role of acculturation stress in alcohol drinking behavior and treatment response.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer a greater burden of alcohol-related health disparities and negative social consequences compared to other racial/ethnic groups, are less likely to initiate and to remain in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with a high density of alcohol outlets.

"Investing in America's Future: Mentoring Latinos in Health Disparities Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary:  Given the heterogeneity of factors such as culture, acculturation, and socioeconomic status, there is a need for additional research related to cardiovascular health and shared protective and risk factors associated with other chronic diseases specific to Latino subgroups. However, there is an under-representation of Latino scientists and university faculty in the US, which contributes to a limitation in insight among scientists seeking to understand and reverse the negative health disparities experienced by Latino communities. It is thus crucial to train and develop future scientists to increase the body of literature on Latino health and to increase Latino community members' access to culturally competent health information and care. As more Latino researchers are trained, there is greater potential to diversify the workforce and promote culturally sensitive research that encourages the continued inclusion and participation of diverse groups in research studies.  The proposed training program, entitled, ""Investing in America's Future: Mentoring Latinos in Health Disparities Research,"" will bring researchers accomplished in Latino community health research (mentors) together with aspiring younger researchers (mentees) to optimize the chances of research success and advancement among the latter and prepare them in turn to train the next generation of individuals who will be working in Latino health. To advance the scientific career development of the junior Latino faculty and scientists, the proposed team will offer a series of trainings and mentoring activities focused on Latino health and health disparities research as related to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other conditions associated with CVD risk factors. These activities, which will involve three separate cohorts of approximately eight Latino mentees each (24 mentees total), will consist of an initial two-week long summer institute, a mid-year visit by a mentor to each of the mentees' research settings, and a second summer institute of one-week, as well as a final meeting of all three cohorts at the conclusion of the study period. Regular communication between mentees and mentors and the provision of a modest stipend to pursue additional training will complement the in-person activities.  The ultimate goal of the program is to equip the junior researchers with the skills necessary to develop manuscripts and submit a grant proposal related to health disparities and CVD within two years of completing the program. The proposed research training program will be evaluated periodically to determine the overall relevance and value of the methods employed. Mentee and mentor feedback will be used to refine the program to best meet the needs of the participants. Further, portions of the program will be disseminated at its conclusion to allow others who are not able to attend to develop productive Latino health research careers using aspects of the training.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative:  There is an under-representation of Latino scientists in the US, which contributes to a narrowing of insights among scientists seeking to understand and reverse the negative health disparities experienced by Latino communities.

The Kansas Community  Cancer Disparities Network (KCCDN) headquartered at the University of Kansas Medical Center will  concentrate on reaching rural Al and Latinos with innovative programs to improve knowledge, access and  utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral cancer procedures. Using community based participatory  research methods (CBPR) and linking our primary care research network (the Kansas Physicians Engaged  in Prevention Research, KPEPR) to our newly formed Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) hospital network, we  will improve outreach, research, and training on cancer disparities in two rural counties; Finney County (SW  Kansas; Latino) and Brown County (NE Kansas; Al). Our CNP Network will capitalize on thriving research  programs offered in our AHECS, Telemedicine Center and safety-net clinic system (Kansas Association for  the Medically Underserved, KAMU), and it will leverage strong and trusting relationships we have built while  providing service and collecting needs assessment data in both the regional Al and Latino communities.  Effective, standing community advisory boards (CABs) in each community were consulted directly during the  design and planning of this proposal and we have structured a CNP Network governance that assures  community interests come first. Our Outreach Core activities will build on the strengths available within the  MCA, KPEPR, and the Telemedicine Office and allow for expanded and improved education through  promotores, IT resources, and theory-driven strategic communications and a social marketing campaigns.  With direct input from rural partners we will conduct a rigorous and controlled clinical trial, testing the efficacy  of a novel intervention based on the ""implementation intentions"" construct to promote breast cancer  screening in Latina and Al women (PI, Engelman). Our Pilot Educational Project will utilize promotores and  ties to the MCA network to enhance knowledge, awareness and interest in cancer clinical trials among  targeted Al and Latino communities (PI, Cupertino). Our Training Core program will rest on a strong  foundation formed by our K30 clinical research curriculum program and an interdisciplinary T-32 fellowship  program (PI, Greiner) specifically designed to train health disparities researchers through community-based  research activities. Our KCCDN will succeed in reducing cancer disparities for Kansas' rural Latinos and  American Indians because it creates a vision for seamless blending access to care enhancements, culturally  tailored educational outreach, rigorous research, and junior investigator CBPR training. Using the building  blocks already in place, our model program will reach vulnerable minorities and generate disseminable  knowledge for the national CNP consortium.

"Culturally-Sensitive School-Home Behavioral Program for Latino Children with ADHD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research and training plan aims to provide the applicant with experience implementing and analyzing Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Disorder (ADHD) clinical trials, utilizing qualitative methodolog to determine meaningful themes and develop culturally sensitive guidelines for diverse families in need of mental health services, expanding multicultural competence and sensitivity, and advancing independence as a clinical researcher. ADHD is one of the most common childhood mental health disorders across cultures, with the continuously growing Latino youth population displaying as great or greater risk for ADHD. Latino children experience unfortunate mental health disparities leaving them less likely to seek and receive appropriate ADHD services, which can prevent long-lasting and widespread impairment in the areas of academic, social, and familial functioning related to ADHD. In order to reduce mental health disparities for Latino children, the field is in need of culturally-sensitive clinical psychologists trained to conduct intervention research and develop guidelines for culturally appropriate ADHD services. The training proposed in the current plan will set the stage for the applicant's career as an independent clinical researcher focused on developing, investigating, and disseminating culturally-appropriate assessment and treatment practices for children with ADHD. These goals not only serve as priorities for the applicant, but also appeal to two of the four current National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) objectives (i.e., developing new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illnesses and strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research).  The sponsor, Dr. Linda Pfiffner, is an established clinical researcher who has served as the principal investigator of multiple ADHD clinical trials, including the current Department of Education (DOE) funded efficacy trial of Collaborative Life Skills (CLS) Program- the intervention proposed in the current research/training plan. The co-sponsor, Dr. Patricia Arean, has extensive experience with multicultural clinical psychology, including clinical/research work with Latino Americans. The mentorship of the sponsors, as well as the training resources available at UCSF, provide the ideal opportunity for the applicant to complete the proposed research and training plan and achieve the following specific aims:  Aim 1) Compare Latino and non-Latino families recruited for and participating in ADHD services at all levels of the help-seeking behavior model.  Aim 2) Conduct mixed-method investigation with Latino families participating in CLS and develop culturally- sensitive guidelines for ADHD behavioral treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although Latino children (who are expected to comprise one quarter of the youth population by 2050) are at as great or greater risk for displaying ADHD, Latino children are under-diagnosed and underserved compared to non-Latino children. Investigation of differential response to existing evidence-based treatments for ADHD and subsequent development of culturally-sensitive guidelines may increase problem recognition, encourage decision to seek appropriate help, and improve completion of, satisfaction with, and outcomes from service utilization to ultimately reduce the mental health disparities between Latino and non-Latino children with ADHD.            ",Culturally-Sensitive School-Home Behavioral Program for Latino Children with ADHD,8595205,F32MH101971,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Parents ', ' Psychologist ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Schools ', ' Social Workers ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Competence ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Population Research ', ' Research Training ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' stem ', ' service utilization ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2013,51608,0.09150255744711425
"Sobadors in the Health Care Utilization of Mexican Americans and Immigrants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to conventional health care providers increases the health risk of Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants and contributes to health disparities.  Latinos are less likely to have health insurance or a consistent healthcare provider than the general population, and they often work in occupations that place them at elevated risk for musculoskeletal pain and injuries, contributing to health disparities.  Few studies have examined how Latinos make decisions regarding whether to access conventional care or traditional care, including the use of sobadors, in new immigrant communities.  Sobadors are traditional healers who draw upon Mexican healing practices such as massage and therapeutic maneuvers to treat musculoskeletal pain and disorders perceived to be related to abdominal organs. Information about sobador use is limited-however, it suggests that sobador use is widespread.  This research will (1) delineate factors that affect Latino participants'  use of sobadors, including predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, and need, as reported by Latinos  who reside in NC, (2) delineate the health beliefs of sobadors and the strategies they use to diagnose patient  health conditions, and identify strategies sobadors use to treat patients' health conditions as recorded through  sobador interviews and video recorded treatments, and (3) delineate how Latinos' predisposing characteristics,  enabling resources, and need affect integration, or lack thereof, of sobador and conventional care use, as  reported by Latinos who reside in NC.  The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations guides the research design and analysis.  Semi-structured in-depth interviews will be conducted with 24 Latino patients living in NC.   Patient participants will be restricted to individuals aged 18 and older who used a sobador during the previous two years.  Six sobadors will also be interviewed.  Sobador treatment sessions with 24 patients will be video recorded-sobadors will subsequently explain the recorded activity.  All interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and translated.  A computer-assisted, systematic analysis procedure will be used to delineate and compare the factors that affect Latino participants' use of sobadors and conventional health care and to delineate the health beliefs and practices of sobadors.  A chiropractor trained in manipulation, mobilization, and massage techniques will carefully examine the videotapes and evaluate the techniques performed.  These results will provide the foundation for an R01 application in which primary data will be collected to examine frequency of use of sobadors and conventional care providers to treat specific symptoms among US Latinos, the effect of sobador-provided treatments on Latinos' well-being, and strategies that increase Latino access to conventional providers when allopathic care is indicated.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about how Latino Americans and Latino immigrants make decisions regarding use of sobadors, traditional healers who provide massage and therapeutic maneuvers to treat musculoskeletal problems and disorders perceived to be related to organs in the abdominal region.  Results from this study will provide the foundation for research on the interface between traditional Latino medical practices and the use of conventional medicine among Latinos in new settlement communities.               ",Sobadors in the Health Care Utilization of Mexican Americans and Immigrants,8432649,R21AT007255,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Affect ', ' Belief ', ' California ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' Health Care Seeking Behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Latin America ', ' massage therapy ', ' Massage ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' New Mexico ', ' North Carolina ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physicians ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rheumatic Diseases ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain Disorder ', ' Rheumatism ', ' Risk ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Texas ', ' Translating ', ' video recording system ', ' Videorecording ', ' Video Recording ', ' Videotape ', ' Work ', ' Health Benefit ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Healed ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Mexican ', ' agriculture worker ', ' Agricultural Workers ', ' Licensing ', ' injury of musculoskeleted system ', ' injury of musculoskeletal system (disorder) ', ' musculoskeletal injury ', ' Immigrant ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Chiropractor ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Clinic ', ' Techniques ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' American ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' response ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' healing ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Sobador ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' public health relevance ', ' traditional care ', ' conventional treatment ', ' conventional therapy ', ' ']",NCCIH,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R21,2013,210900,0.17116983796868007
"A Multi-Ethnic Faith and Public Health Partnership to Reduce Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congregational involvement has been promoted as a way to help reduce health disparities among African Americans and Latinos in the U.S; however, the multifaceted health needs found in many urban areas, as well as the complex set of factors leading to health inequalities, mean that broad and sustainable, multi- ethnic, multi-denominational faith and health partnerships are needed. The goal of this project is to build a network of African-American and Latino congregational leaders, public health partners, and researchers to jointly reduce disparities in South Los Angeles (LA). The specific aims of the project are: 1) Develop a sustainable faith and public health partnership to build capacity to address health disparities experienced by Latinos and African Americans; 2) Jointly develop an intervention to leverage congregational and public health resources toward the goal of reducing disparities in outcomes for Latinos and African Americans for an identified health condition; 3) Pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among African American and Latino congregations. The specific health condition and intervention strategy used will be defined by a Steering Committee composed of key denominational and inter-denominational associations and public health entities serving South Los Angeles, together with researchers at the RAND Corporation and its primary community partner, Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches (LAM); based on initial input, the focus will likely be on one of three health issues: cancer, obesity, or HIV. The study will be collaborative throughout all stages, and we will develop strategies to strengthen the partnership's capacity to address health disparities beyond the focus on this initial condition. The partnership is innovative in bringing together religious, public health, and research organizations to address health disparities jointly and in using novel techniques for soliciting community input. Further, it emphasizes mutual capacity building and sustainability so that researchers are better able to design and evaluate interventions; congregations gain knowledge about community health issues and skills in conducting health programs; and public health practitioners contribute to and learn from the development of best practices in promoting community health.         RELEVANCE: This will be the first multi-ethnic, multi-denominational faith and public health research partnership that aims to reduce health disparities in an on-going and interactive fashion and using novel techniques to obtain community input. This effort will lead to an in-depth understanding of diverse faith community perspectives on health disparities and the potential for addressing them through congregation-based programming.                  ",A Multi-Ethnic Faith and Public Health Partnership to Reduce Health Disparities,8498793,R24MD007943,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Community Participation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Resources ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' Influenza Vaccines ', ' Flu vaccine ', ' Influenza virus vaccine ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Solutions ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Visual ', ' Inequality ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' Church ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' authority ', ' metropolitan ', ' care seeking ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' prevention service ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health organization ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' health inequalities ', ' public health research ', ' population health ', ' shared decision making ', ' screening ', ' Affect ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R24,2013,447104,0.11443488535023993
"Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Underserved Communities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Aging Latino Communities BACKGROUND: Aging Latino adults suffer disproportionately from a number of chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity) improved by increased physical activities (PA) such as walking. Due to language, education, computer, and health literacy barriers, older Latino adults often cannot readily access typical health promotion programs offered in-person or online in U.S. communities. Lay health advisors (""promoters"" in Spanish) offer a nationally recognized, culturally tailored and cost-efficient health behavior change model for Latino communities. However, as with all ""human"" delivered health programs, they impose constraints on participant schedules, and, even with careful intervention fidelity procedures in place, some variability in program delivery across advisors is inevitable. Computer-based culturally tailored physical activity advisor programs can potentially reduce human- to-human scheduling and fidelity constraints and extend program reach. In a recently completed 4- month experiment, a computer-based bilingual Virtual Advisor with touch-screen interactivity (no keyboard or mouse needed) was housed in a community center and programmed to tailor PA advice to the needs and preferences of low-income, aging Latino adults. The Virtual Advisor program successfully increased regular walking levels in participants compared to a health education control. OBJECTIVE: The primary study aim is to conduct a comparative effectiveness trial evaluating the 12- month impacts of the community-based Virtual Advisor PA program relative to a proven Lay Advisor program in a broader population of aging Latino adults. The secondary aim is to determine the comparative cost effectiveness of the Virtual vs. Lay Advisor programs. DESIGN: The 12-month randomized trial will enroll inactive Latino adults ages 55 years and older living near 16 neighborhood community centers (n=265/arm; 530 total). The primary outcome is minutes of walking per week, and additional outcomes of interest include BMI, sedentary behavior, functional performance, and health- related quality of life. Additional areas of investigation are to evaluate theoretically based and empirically supported moderators and mediators of intervention success and determine the potential generalizability of the interventions. IMPACT: The study seeks to demonstrate that a computer-based Virtual Advisor tailored to the needs of aging Latino adults can provide an effective and potentially cost-efficien alternative to Lay Advisors in community settings frequented by this population. The potential extended reach of such programs for use in a range of community settings (e.g., clinics, pharmacies, libraries) provides substantial promise for positively impacting the current health disparities gap.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there has been an explosion of computerized health promotion programs to increase regular physical activity-a key health behavior linked with the prevention and control of our nation's major killers--few have been adapted to the needs and preferences of low-income Latino adults. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based 'virtual lay advisor' relative to a proven human lay advisor program-both delivered at local community centers--in promoting regular walking among inactive midlife and older Latino adults. The Virtual Advisor program represents a potentially low-cost alternative to person-delivered health promotion programs that could be translated for use in a range of community settings (e.g., clinics, pharmacies, libraries).            ",Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Underserved Communities,8503069,R01HL116448,"['Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Accountability ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Walking ', ' Latino ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' man-machine interaction ', ' computer human interaction ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Trust ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' health literacy ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' monetary value ', ' economic value ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' natural language ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior ', ' Be element ', ' Beryllium ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Cues ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electronics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,750675,0.0774292805521725
"Life Course Socioeconomics, Acculturation, & Type-2 Diabetes Risk Among Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the US carry a disproportionate burden of type-2 diabetes. Research has implicated life course socioeconomic position as a major factor in the development of chronic diseases, such as type-2 diabetes; yet most evidence is limited to non-Hispanic White populations. We hypothesize that the large disparities in type-2 diabetes among Latinos reflects the joint effect of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic factors, cultural characteristics, behaviors, biology, and other risk factors accumulating over the life course. The experience of Latinos in the US represents an especially fruitful context in which to investigate the influence of life course socioeconomic and cultural resources in relation to type-2 diabetes. In addition to being the fastest growing minority population with high rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes, the experience of Latinos is one that includes first generation immigrants with limited education and job skills, and later generations who are born and raised in the US and show varying levels of acculturation and assimilation, behavioral change, and socioeconomic advancement. With these unique considerations in mind, the present study seeks to: (1) examine the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; (2) assess whether acculturation modifies the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; and 3) examine whether metabolic and inflammatory markers related to behavioral, physiological, and psychosocial risk factors mediate the relationships between life course socioeconomic position, acculturation, and type-2 diabetes among Latinos. The proposed research activity will constitute the first systematic attempt to assess the unique and synergistic contributions of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type 2 diabetes among Latinos. By assessing life course exposures across two generations of Latinos living in the US, this project provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify targets for early intervention for reducing the heavy burden of type-2 diabetes among Latinos. More broadly, the proposed research may uncover crucial life course socioeconomic and cultural patterning of risk factors or health promoting characteristics that may also benefit other race/ethnic minorities disproportionately living in poverty and suffering from type-2 diabetes.

"Kansas Community Cancer Health Disparities Network American Indian and Latino populations suffer from significant cancer disparities. Rural Al and Latino  communities, in geographically large states, such as Kansas, experience even greater access to cancer  screening and treatment disadvantage due to dispersion of specialists and facilities. The Kansas Community  Cancer Disparities Network (KCCDN) headquartered at the University of Kansas Medical Center will  concentrate on reaching rural Al and Latinos with innovative programs to improve knowledge, access and  utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral cancer procedures. Using community based participatory  research methods (CBPR) and linking our primary care research network (the Kansas Physicians Engaged  in Prevention Research, KPEPR) to our newly formed Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) hospital network, we  will improve outreach, research, and training on cancer disparities in two rural counties; Finney County (SW  Kansas; Latino) and Brown County (NE Kansas; Al). Our CNP Network will capitalize on thriving research  programs offered in our AHECS, Telemedicine Center and safety-net clinic system (Kansas Association for  the Medically Underserved, KAMU), and it will leverage strong and trusting relationships we have built while  providing service and collecting needs assessment data in both the regional Al and Latino communities.  Effective, standing community advisory boards (CABs) in each community were consulted directly during the  design and planning of this proposal and we have structured a CNP Network governance that assures  community interests come first. Our Outreach Core activities will build on the strengths available within the  MCA, KPEPR, and the Telemedicine Office and allow for expanded and improved education through  promotores, IT resources, and theory-driven strategic communications and a social marketing campaigns.  With direct input from rural partners we will conduct a rigorous and controlled clinical trial, testing the efficacy  of a novel intervention based on the ""implementation intentions"" construct to promote breast cancer  screening in Latina and Al women (PI, Engelman). Our Pilot Educational Project will utilize promotores and  ties to the MCA network to enhance knowledge, awareness and interest in cancer clinical trials among  targeted Al and Latino communities (PI, Cupertino). Our Training Core program will rest on a strong  foundation formed by our K30 clinical research curriculum program and an interdisciplinary T-32 fellowship  program (PI, Greiner) specifically designed to train health disparities researchers through community-based  research activities. Our KCCDN will succeed in reducing cancer disparities for Kansas' rural Latinos and  American Indians because it creates a vision for seamless blending access to care enhancements, culturally  tailored educational outreach, rigorous research, and junior investigator CBPR training. Using the building  blocks already in place, our model program will reach vulnerable minorities and generate disseminable  knowledge for the national CNP consortium.

"Addressing acquiescence: Reducing survey error to promote Latino health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous advances have improved our ability to collect valid and reliable data on health behaviors and outcomes. However, health behaviors are often influenced by psychosocial variables - such as attitudes and beliefs - that are unobservable and, thus, more difficult to measure. Attitudes and beliefs are typically measured using Likert-scaled items, in which respondents rate their agreement with statements along a continuum. Since the 1920s, researchers have observed that some respondents tend to systematically agree to Likert-scaled questionnaire items, regardless of question content. This pattern of responding to survey questions is known as acquiescent response style (ARS). ARS jeopardizes efforts to reduce health disparities. ARS can weaken health experts' understanding of what factors influence health behaviors, their ability to create effective interventions, and th accuracy with which they evaluate programs to reduce health disparities. Research indicates that ARS use may be influenced by culture, and, in the U.S., may be of particular concern when surveying Latino populations. Research by the investigators and others suggests that 22-24 percent of Latino survey respondents acquiesce on health surveys, as compared to 13 percent of non-Latino Whites. These culturally patterned differences in ARS may introduce error in health survey data, which, in turn, may artificially create or enhance distinctions both within Latino populations and between Latinos and non-Latino Whites, thereby erroneously informing health disparities research. The Latino population is demographically and culturally diverse, and almost nothing is known about what factors may drive ARS use among Latinos from different ethnic or cultural groups. Further, despite a growing need to obtain valid health data from Latinos, who comprise 16 percent of the U.S. population and are expected to increase to 29 percent by 2050, it is unclear how to address ARS. The proposed study will: (1) identify predictors of ARS; and (2) screen for the most promising methods of reducing ARS during data collection and adjusting for ARS after data collection is complete. This research focuses on Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans, as these groups comprise the three largest Latino sub-groups. Data from this study will be derived from two surveys. The first survey will gather data from 2900 Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, and non-Latino Whites in order to identify factors associated with ARS. The second survey will compare different methods of addressing ARS among 1161 Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Cuban American health survey respondents. Findings from this research will provide researchers with empirically driven guidance on when to anticipate and how to reduce ARS-associated measurement error when surveying Latino respondents. Such knowledge will improve health data validity through increased ARS awareness and standardization of methods to address ARS, thereby contributing to more accurate understanding of the psychosocial determinants of Latino health, more effective health promotion programs targeting Latinos, and better long-term Latino health outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will enhance our ability to address an important source of health survey measurement error, which, when unaddressed, may weaken our understanding of moderators and mediators of health behaviors, our ability to create effective interventions, and the accuracy of our efforts to evaluate programs to redress Latino health disparities. Findings from this research will empower health researchers to make empirically guided decisions about the collection and treatment of survey data as they promote the health of the U.S.'s growing, culturally diverse Latino population.            ",Addressing acquiescence: Reducing survey error to promote Latino health,8576303,R01CA172283,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cuban American ', ' Data Collection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Surveys ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Play ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' psychosocial ', ' empowered ', ' trait ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' stem ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2013,515044,0.19886768627056653
"ENLACE: A Promotora-Led Physical Activity Intervention Trial for Latinas in Texas     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Latinos experience a disproportionate burden of hypokinetic-related chronic diseases, threatening the future health of the nation's fastest-growing population. Physical inactivity has been linked to increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. Latinos are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to fail to meet physical activity (PA) recommendations, and Latino women are less physically active than Latino men. The goal of the proposed ENLACE research project is to design, implement and evaluate a promotora-led PA intervention that takes a comprehensive, multi- level, community-based approach to promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among a particularly underserved segment of Latinas. The intervention approach, based on the social ecological model, focuses on individual attitudes and skills, socio-cultural factors and environmental influences to behavior change. The proposed group- randomized controlled trial builds on formative and pilot research (funded by a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute R21, HL087765) by a team of academic investigators and community partners with extensive experience working together to conduct behavioral interventions and outreach with Latino and disadvantaged populations. Eight community resource centers (CRCs) in four predominantly Latino counties in South Texas' Lower Rio Grande Valley will be randomly assigned to either the Enlace PA Intervention (4 CRCs) or an attention-control condition (4 CRCs). We will recruit 704 Latinas ages 18-64 who do not meet national PA guidelines from colonias (unincorporated, impoverished, underserved Latino settlements) in the CRC service areas. Participants from CRCs randomized to the Enlace PA Intervention (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions followed by 24 weeks of a maintenance intervention (monthly promotora-delivered newsletters and telephone counseling). The group sessions' behavioral goal is for Latinas to engage in 30 minutes per day of MVPA on 5 or more days per week. The attention- control group (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions on home safety/first aid and monthly generic health education materials and informational telephone calls during the maintenance intervention period. The primary outcome is minutes per week of MVPA (measured with accelerometers). Secondary outcomes are physical fitness and weight maintenance. We also will evaluate self-efficacy, social support, decisional balance, and collective efficacy as mediators of MVPA changes. Standardized measurement of primary and secondary outcomes will occur at baseline, immediate (16 weeks) and delayed post-intervention (40 weeks). We hypothesize that Latinas in the ENLACE PA Intervention will significantly increase their MVPA levels as a result of addressing their specific individual, socio-cultural and environmental barriers and enhancing their social support and collective efficacy, compared to attention-control Latinas.            Increasing Latinas' ability to gain the benefits of regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is a key strategy for addressing Latino health disparities. Enlace was developed in partnership with community members, to enhance Latina's behavioral skills, promote social support and collective efficacy, and enhance access to culturally appropriate, economical PA resources in their communities. Research results will provide scientific knowledge about effective community-based intervention methods with potential for replication in underserved areas across the nation and will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of community-wide participation in research to bolster efforts to eliminate health disparities.

"Community-Based Prevention of Youth Violence in Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent violence is an important public health problem in the US, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Latinos are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group of children in the US, and are disproportionately affected by youth violence. There is, however, little information on the risk and protective factors that influence Latino youth violence. The overall objective of this proposed NICHD Career Development Award research is to identify risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration. This will be accomplished through three specific aims, which are to: 1) Identify beliefs, attitudes, and norms that influence violence perpetration among Latino adolescents; 2) Identify risk and protective factors in the family, peer, and community contexts that predict violence perpetration in a cohort of Latino youth; and 3) Validate and examine the relative contributions of individual, family, peer, and community factors to violence among Latino adolescents. In Aim 1, focus groups of violent and non-violent Latino adolescents will be conducted to examine risk and protective factors for violence, violence prevention strategies, and components of potentially effective violence prevention interventions. For Aim 2, a secondary data analysis of the National Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) will be conducted using multi-level modeling techniques to determine which contextual factors in adolescence are associated with violence perpetration approximately two years later. The findings from Aims 1 and 2 will be used in Aim 3 to design a survey that concurrently examines individual and contextual factors associated with youth violence, and to test the survey in a large sample of Latino adolescents. Findings from these three studies will provide the foundation for a future Latino youth violence prevention intervention that is culturally tailored, focuses on the major risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence, and is informed by Latino youth. This innovative approach uses multiple methods (qualitative, multi-level longitudinal quantitative, and a survey) to address a significant public health need for improving the knowledge base required to develop successful community-based interventions for Latino youth violence prevention. The proposed award is consistent with the component of the NICHD mission to ensure that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability. The exceptional resources and institutional support at UT Southwestern, outstanding multi-disciplinary mentorship team, and the proposed career development activities, will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and nationally recognized expert on community-based interventions effective in reducing and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence.         There is an epidemic of youth violence in the US, with 36% of adolescents involved in fighting and 18% in weapon-carrying, and Latinos are disproportionately affected by violence; because youth violence can result in serious injury and homicide, there is an urgent need to identify strategies that can lead to successful violence prevention interventions for Latino youth. The proposed research identifies risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration using focus groups with Latino youth, multi-level modeling of a longitudinal dataset, and a newly-designed survey administered to Latino youth. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence, as the proposed research studies could lead to the development of an effective youth violence prevention intervention for Latinos.

"Health Communication & Health Literacy to Improve Care for Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes disparities are common for Latino patients. Effective health communication can potentially narrow these disparities. This proposal details a career development plan that will prepare the principal investigator (PI) for success as an independent investigator with expertise in diabetes-related outcomes, health communication, and delivery of behavioral interventions for Latino diabetes patients. As an Internal Medicine- Pediatrics physician, with training in clinical investigation, the PI will gain new skills through this K23 in the areas of health disparities specific to diabetes care, enhanced Latino cultural competency, audio taping clinical encounters to assess the quality and role of health communication, and the development of a new training program for medical interpreters. The PI's immediate goals are to rigorously examine the quality of health communication between Latino diabetes patients, providers, and Spanish interpreters and the association between health communication and various diabetes-related health outcomes. To meet this goal, the PI has proposed a rigorous career development plan that incorporates additional didactic course work, regular participation in local and national meetings/seminars, a mentored research experience, and active involvement in an extremely supportive research environment. This includes an NIDDK funded Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC), NCRR-funded Meharry Clinical and Translational Research Center (MeTRC), Vanderbilt Program on Effective Health Communication (EHC), and an RCMI-funded Bioinformatics Core. The research specific aims are to: 1) conduct a cross-sectional, descriptive mixed-methods analysis of the quality of health communication between providers and Latino diabetes patients with particular emphasis on the role of the Spanish medical interpreter during language discordant encounters, and explore the association between baseline quality of health communication and various diabetes related health outcomes, 2) conduct an observational cohort study to examine the independent effect of provider health communication training and the use of a Spanish, literacy-sensitive educational toolkit on the quality of health communication during medical encounters, and assess the association between changes in the quality of health communication at 12 months with changes in diabetes related health outcomes, and 3) develop and pilot in a small RCT, an enhanced training program for Spanish medical interpreters geared toward improving their ability to work with providers and patients with LEP and limited health literacy during language discordant encounters. Overall, this K23 program will provide important insights into the nature of health communication with Latinos, the role of Spanish interpreters in this process, and most importantly prepare the PI for independent investigation of the role of effective health communication in addressing disparities in care for Latinos with diabetes.     Effective health communication can potentially improve diabetes care and clinical outcomes for Latino patients. This K23 award will allow the PI to gain expertise in the evaluation of the quality of health communication during clinical encounters between Latino patients, providers, and Spanish medical interpreters and in the delivery of effective behavioral diabetes interventions.

"Health Inequalities: Social Isolation Among Rural Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate for this K01 Award, a Latina nurse researcher, is requesting support for career development training and research, to become an independent investigator in mental health promotion among rural minorities. The overall career goal is to advance science at the nexus of culture, mental health, and rurality. The long-term goals of the training are to (1) build a mental health promotion research agenda among rural minority populations to enable rural communities to implement and sustain healthy socio-emotional environments and (2) serve as a role model and mentor for minority students and junior faculty. Specific short- term goals are to (1) develop and apply expertise in advanced research methods that are critical to an understanding of minority rural populations which can lead to the development of related health policy, (2) understand the role of social isolation in th cultural adaptation of rural Latino families in order to develop culturally relevant interventions, (3) develop expertise in the design and implementation of a repertoire of individual, family, and community public health interventions that reduce social isolation among rural Latinos, and (4) conduct independent investigator-initiated community-based research on mental health promotion among rural Latinos. Social isolation among rural Latino immigrants increases the risk of poor mental health outcomes and is significantly related to depression and anxiety among adults and suicidal ideation in children and adolescents. Longer time spent in the U.S. is associated with higher risk of mental health problems among Latinos, yet early promotion of mental health has not been targeted among this population. The specific aims of the proposed research are to (1) explore the effect of Latino immigrants' perceptions of their rural social environment and social isolation on their mental well-being through ethnographic interviews, (2) evaluate protective factors and modifiable risks to mental well-being associated with social isolation and the social environment among Latino immigrants living in a rural area, and (3) design a culturally appropriate family centered intervention to strengthen significant intrafamilia and intercommunity networks and promote positive mental well-being. This exploratory study is guided by community engagement research principles and employs mixed-methods to unravel the complexities of social isolation and develop an intervention to promote mental well-being among rural Latino immigrants. In-depth ethnographic interviews (N=60) and a quantitative community assessment survey (N=100) will be conducted with Latino women and men living in the rural ""new destinations"" of north Florida. Findings and engagement with an established community advisory board will culminate in the development of a family centered intervention to promote mental well-being. A mentoring team of distinguished national and international scientists has been assembled to achieve the training and research goals. The K01 Award will lead to an R21 proposal to pilot the family centered intervention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The K01 Award is an excellent fit with my overall career goal to advance science at the nexus of culture, mental health, and rurality. Immigrant Latinos living in rural areas of the U.S. are vastly underrepresented in mental health promotion. Results of this research and collaboration with community partners will be instrumental for developing a family centered intervention to promote mental health in this underserved population.            ",Health Inequalities: Social Isolation Among Rural Latinos,8499797,K01NR013672,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Manuals ', ' Maps ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mothers ', ' Nurses ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Rural Population ', ' Science ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social isolation ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Friends ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Rural Community ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' base ', ' career ', ' role model ', ' rural area ', ' Mental health promotion ', ' Left ', ' Chronic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' Complex ', ' psychosocial ', ' Church ', ' experience ', ' physical separation ', ' stressor ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Data ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Training ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' community organizations ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' health inequalities ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2013,86095,0.028172198462700585
"Partners for Strong, Healthy Families (PSHF)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos are a population at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases and use of substances. Latino youth are 2.8 times more likely to contract chlamydia, 2.2 times more likely to contract gonorrhea, 2.1 times more likely to contract syphilis (CDC, 2010) and have a higher rate of HPV infection, when compared to Whites. Latino 8th and 10th graders are also more likely than their White or Black peers to report lifetime past-year or past-month use of marijuana, cocaine, crack, and hallucinogens (Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2010). To date, efforts have been insufficient to reduce this disparity. But few studies have addressed multiple risks occurring concomitantly or independently by  engaging Latino families, youth and the community together in all aspects of intervention development. This community-based participatory research (CBPR) between the University of Southern California (USC) and Bienestar Health Services (BHS) aims to correct this inequity by including vulnerable Latino youth (16-21 years of age), families and the community to identity local needs, select, implement and test a pilot intervention in Los Angeles. We seek to  empower Latino families, youth, and community gate keepers in the discovery of culturally grounded intervention/s that optimally address complex-multiple risk processes resulting in serious inequities among Latino youth. Our aims are: 1) to establish a coalition -Partners for Strong Healthy Families (PSHF)- led by a Community Advisory Board (CAB) (community gatekeepers, parents, youths, Latino organizations) to engage in CBPR; collect data among 898 participants using qualitative and quantitative methods (needs assessment (n=400), an environmental scan in the selected community, 8 focus groups (n=96), key informant interviews (n=20), group model-building (GMB) via 6 small group meetings (n=120)) to identify community priorities and preferences; pilot test the resulting culturally tailored- language specific intervention (n=130 pr and 110 post test) that will provide detailed strategies to boost protective factors and reduce ris for engaging in early sex and substance use, strengthening Latino families; and evaluate the PSHF partnership and CAB on adherence to CBPR principles (n=22). An experienced CBPR team is committed to engaging Latino families, youth and community from conceptualization through dissemination in the discovery of new effective treatments and prevention strategies to address these complex multiple risk behaviors and reduce disparities.  RELEVANCE (See instructions): In adolescent health, sexual risk and substance use are among the most difficult problems for families to address with their children. This CBPR study is directly relevant to discovering community based-culturally tailored intervention/s that reveal optimal ways to engage families, youth and communities; leads to the emergence of new effective strategies for treatment and prevention against multifactorial risk behaviors (sex & drugs and empowers Latinos to set their own cultural pathways to reduce these complex inequities.

"NIMHD RESEARCH CENTER ON LATINO IMMIGRANT/REFUGEE HEALTH DISPARITIES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The changing demographics of the U.S. population ~ in which recent immigrants are playing a key role in population growth ~ have and will continue to exert a major influence on the course of health disparities. Therefore, the very timely overall mission of the proposed GWU NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center is to build on an existing academic-community collaboration with the Latino immigrant population in the Washington, DC metropolitan area in order to better understand factors contributing to racial/ethnic minority health disparities specific to this critical population, to increase both community and academic capacity to address these factors, and to test a multi-level community intervention addressing the health disparity issue of substance abuse and co-occurring conditions. This collaboration will: 1) Contribute to the transdisciplinary advancement of the field with respect to eliminating health disparities as well as the health of the Latino community; 2) Develop, implement and evaluate an innovative, community-driven, multi-component community intervention (called ADELANTE) that addresses a vulnerability cluster of substance abuse and co-occurring conditions in youth and families ; 3) Provide an ongoing mechanism for training and educating faculty, students and community members in a range of issues related to addressing racial/ethnic health disparities generally and in Latino immigrant/refugee populations; and provide opportunities for partner community members to gain specific research skills that will increase capacity and research participation; and 4) Support the overall mission of the Center by conducting specific, collaborative activities aimed at: increasing skills and knowledge related to preventing substance abuse and related health conditions, testing innovative social media and branding strategies to increase the likelihood of behavior change, and improving health literacy and capacity using a tested community training approach. 5) Disseminate the results of the research to the participating communities and to the field, via the Center website and multiple channels.             The proposed Center is highly relevant because of its demographic focus, its foundation In an existing university-community partnership, and the clear need to develop collaborative intervention and research approaches to address health disparities in this significant population group.",NIMHD RESEARCH CENTER ON LATINO IMMIGRANT/REFUGEE HEALTH DISPARITIES,8484874,P20MD006898,"['Communities ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors in Puerto Rican Youth Growing Up     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use/abuse (SU/SUD) and other HIV/STI risk behaviors are major public health challenges not equally distributed across racial/ethnic groups. The fastest growing minority population in the US, Latino  youth, have elevated rates HIV/STI risk behaviors and SU/SUD, particularly among those abandoning  traditional Latino values and shifting towards American values (acculturation). This application, in response to  PA-09-236: HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations in the US (R01), aims to identify factors related  to the development of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection among Latino youth during a critical  transitional developmental period: emerging adulthood. Existing studies have revealed important disparities, however, they are limited in their ability to identify processes relevant for Latino youth, as they have not included sufficient numbers of Latino youth from fairly homogeneous subgroups (e.g.  Puerto Ricans, Mexican- Americans, etc.) and lack information about acculturation, a key determinant of risk among Latino youth. We propose to conduct the fourth wave on the Boricua Youth Study (BYS~ R01 MH56401) focused on HIV/STI risk, infection in emerging adulthood (BYS Wave 4, N=1,992, youth ages 16 - 24). The BYS has already generated 3 waves of data (years 2001 to 2004) on children of Puerto Rican background (ages 5 -13 at Wave 1), with study findings described in 19 peer-reviewed publications to date. Besides the comprehensive longitudinal assessment strategy, a unique feature of the BYS is its two-site design, as it included children living in the South Bronx (SBx), NYC and San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR). At BYS Wave 4, we propose to conduct intensive assessment of HIV/STI risk (including testing for HIV and STIs) and enhance the assessment of SU/SUD, in addition to continuing tracking of cultural experiences, and psychiatric disorders and other factors. The proposed study has as its specific aims, to examine: (I) Prevalence of HIV/STI risk behaviors and rates of HIV/STI infection in emerging adulthood and the influence of sexual orientation, teenage unintended pregnancy and early sexual debut. (II) How development of SU/SUD (nicotine, alcohol, illicit/prescription drugs) starting in childhood/earlyadolescence may influence HIV/STI risk in emerging adulthood in the context of a  Ecodevelopmental framework. (III) The role of acculturation (cultural practices, identification, values) in relation to SU/SUD and its relationship to HIV/STI risk behaviors/infection.

"Cancer Survivorship:  Telling a Story through the Eyes of  ""Esperanza"" (Hope)  Ap This proposal will be building upon a prior positive collaborative working relationship between the community-based, minority serving institution, Padres Contra El Cancer [Parents against Cancer] (PADRES) and the Childhood Cancer Survivorship Program at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JOCC). The four years of the grant will establish infrastructure support required to sustain the ongoing research collaboration. PADRES and UCLA will synergy their efforts to better understand and address the needs of Latino childhood cancer survivors and their families. The objectives for the overall research strategy include: (1) formalize the infrastructure of the community-academic research partnership between PADRES and the JCCC in order to understand how to best develop culturally-relevant survivorship educational interventions for the Latino pediatric, adolescent, and young adult survivorship community given their risk for late effects; (2) to test the effectiveness of this intervention developed through this collaborative research partnership and disseminate the significant findings nationally for the mutual benefits of both partners; (3) through the development of the formalized research infrastructure, leadership within the PADRES/JCCC partnership will be able provide education, training, and empowerment to its diverse groups of members regarding how to improve access to cancer survivorship care through the model of community-based participatory research and be a resource for guidance to other programs nationally. This partnership will bring together the expertise and experience of the Internal Advisory Committee and Community Advisory Board to develop a culturally-relevant survivorship educational intervention during the implementation stage. The intervention will be tested for its acceptability and feasibility for delivery in the community setting. The expected outcome of this study is to develop the intervention in the form of a photonovela which can then be tested nationally in the Latino survivor community for its effectiveness to decrease stigma and improve families' survivorship care discussions and knowledge about the importance of survivorship care planning. This partnership will address health disparities highlighted in the Institute of Medicine's report on Childhood Cancer Survivorship: Improving Care and Quality of Life, President's Cancer Panel 2010 meeting, and Healthy People's 2010 objectives. Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for eariy morbidity and mortality due to previous cancer treatment. Cancer stigma among Latino families affected by cancer coupled with the knowledge gap regarding the need for survivorship-focused care may widen the existing health disparities for the Latino population.","Cancer Survivorship:  Telling a Story through the Eyes of  ""Esperanza"" (Hope)  Ap",8538313,P20CA157070,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Family ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Leadership ', ' Literature ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Parents ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Siblings ', ' survivorship ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Survivors ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pediatric neoplasm/cancer ', ' pediatric malignancy ', ' pediatric cancer ', ' Malignant Pediatric Tumor ', ' Malignant Pediatric Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Childhood Tumor ', ' Childhood Cancers ', ' Malignant Childhood Neoplasm ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Cardiopulmonary ', ' meetings ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' secondary cancer ', ' Secondary Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Secondary Malignancy (After Treatment of Primary Cancer) ', ' Secondary Malignancy ', ' Second Cancer ', ' Second Primary Cancers ', ' ray (radiation) ', ' Radiation ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Address ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Improve Access ', "" President's Cancer Panel "", ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' CCSS ', ' Childhood Cancer Survivor Study ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' pediatric cancer survivor ', ' childhood cancer survivor ', ' Population ', ' Coupled ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' chemotherapy ', ' community based participatory research ', ' community setting ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P20,2013,181578,0.052588349208115545
"Increasing Water Intake In Lieu of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages among Latino Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, ""Increasing Water Intake In Lieu of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages among Latino Youth,"" is a three-year proposal in response to PA-12-102 R13 Academic-Community Partnership Conference Series. The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance an existing academic-community partnership that will inform priorities for an intervention to increase intake of tap water in lieu of SSBs among Latino children and adolescents. Drinking water instead of SSBs can reduce children's total daily caloric intake thereby reducing obesity. This issue is of particular significance among Latino youth as they are more likely to drink SSBs and less likely to drink tap water than White and Asian children. To date, few interventions have focused on increasing water intake among children and there have been no interventions that have focused on increasing tap water intake among Latino children. For the past five years, researchers at the University Of California (CA) at San Francisco and the Atkins Center for Weight and Health at Berkeley in conjunction with nutrition advocates at the CA Food Policy Advocates have collaborated to improve drinking water access and intake in CA public schools. During a March 2012 convening, local, state, and national stakeholders prioritized a need for the development and evaluation of school-based interventions that promote intake of tap water instead of SSBs among populations most at risk for obesity. Support from this grant will allow us to build on this recent meeting and augment partnerships with community-based organizations from the CA Central Valley, an agricultural region with a large low-income, Latino population, to address disparities in beverage intake among Latino youth. Community-partnerships are essential to addressing such inequities. Specific activities for the academic-community partnership will include 1) bringing together a group of diverse stakeholders representing broad domains of research, policy, and community, 2) development of a memorandum of understanding to codify the partnership, 3) bimonthly meetings to clarify and delineate stakeholders' priorities for a school-based intervention focused on increasing tap water intake instead of SSBs among Latino children and adolescents, and 4) regular dissemination events to the broader community (i.e., national expert presentations, reports of local research study findings and board progress, case studies of innovative school practices, and methods workshops relevant to the community [e.g., drinking water testing, photovoice]). At the end of the three-year period, the academic-community partnership will produce the following products: development of an R01 application to examine the effect of a school-based intervention to promote tap water intake on obesity among Latino children and adolescents, submission of at least three peer-reviewed manuscripts, attainment of funded grant proposals, and introduction of relevant legislation.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) can reduce childhood obesity. Even though Latino youth are more likely to be obese and to drink SSBs than their non-Latino peers, there is very limited research in this area. Such investigation is critical in designing and implementing interventions and policies to encourage intake of water instead of sugary drinks among Latino children. This conference will help provide direction for research on this topic.            ",Increasing Water Intake In Lieu of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages among Latino Youth,8554791,R13HD075498,"['Affect ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Beverages ', ' California ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Energy Intake ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Water Intake ', ' Water consumption ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Legislation ', ' Statutes and Laws ', ' Methods ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Peer Review ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' San Francisco ', ' Schools ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' case report ', ' Case Study ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Process Measure ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Distal ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' sugar ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Food Policy ', ' Funding ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' drinking water ', ' Manuscripts ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' peer ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' drinking ', ' youth alcohol consumption ', ' underage alcohol use ', ' underage alcohol consumption ', ' under age alcohol use ', ' under age alcohol consumption ', ' teenager alcohol use ', ' teenage drinking ', ' teenage alcohol use ', ' teen drinking ', ' drinking during adolescence ', ' alcohol use during adolescence ', ' alcohol intake among adolescents ', ' alcohol during adolescence ', ' adolescent drinking ', ' adolescent alcohol use ', ' adolescent alcohol consumption ', ' Youth Drinking ', ' underage drinking ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' water testing ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Intake ', ' Policy Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' obesity risk ', ' community organizations ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' product development ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R13,2013,30000,0.08618864992937048
"Family Care of Older Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos age 65 or older have a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes, and more severe complications from the disease, compared to non-Latino Whites. Latino elders' consequent risks for functional impairment and permanent disability raise questions about their family environment and the role caregivers play in helping them to manage the disease. Studying the family environment is important for addressing and eventually eliminating Latinos' health disparities arising from this chronic disease. The purpose of this Career Development Award is to provide mentored research and professional training to prepare me for a career as a federally-funded, independent investigator on health disparities and aging research in the area of family care of older Latinos. My immediate goals are to 1) develop a research program that characterizes the care of older adults within the Mexican-origin family; and 2) develop proficiency in culturally-relevant interventions for Latino elders and their caregivers. I propose to move my research beyond the female caregiver, toward a family level approach to elder care along one specific health dimension, management of type 2 diabetes. The K01 award builds directly on my current work by 1) including the perspectives of caregiving men and diabetic care-receiving elders; and 2) examining the process of family elder care through observation of caregiver-care receiver dyads (CG-CR dyad) in home settings. I propose three phases of research that culminate in developing and evaluating the feasibility of a CG-CR dyad intervention to improve care receiving Latino elders' diabetes outcomes. The training aspect of this award will provide me with in-depth knowledge in: 1) theory development and measurement of family care of Latino elders; 2) observational methods in home settings; and 3) intervention development and evaluation. My long-term objective is to establish a research trajectory based on theoretical and empirical principles that can be applied in real-world settings to improve the health outcomes of community-dwelling Latino elders. The interdisciplinary mentoring team I put together and my affiliations with the UCLA RCMAR and the UCLA School of Public Health provide the infrastructure to support these endeavors.       RELEVANCE: The proposed research focuses on older Latinos, the largest and second fastest aging sub-population in the United States. Many older Latinos have diabetes and suffer severe consequences from the disease, leading to poor health and disability. This research looks at the role of family caregivers in Latino elders' management of diabetes, one step toward finding ways to improve Latino elders' health in this area.

"Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors in Puerto Rican Youth Growing Up     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use/abuse (SU/SUD) and other HIV/STI risk behaviors are major public health challenges not equally distributed across racial/ethnic groups. The fastest growing minority population in the US, Latino  youth, have elevated rates HIV/STI risk behaviors and SU/SUD, particularly among those abandoning  traditional Latino values and shifting towards American values (acculturation). This application, in response to  PA-09-236: HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations in the US (R01), aims to identify factors related  to the development of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection among Latino youth during a critical  transitional developmental period: emerging adulthood. Existing studies have revealed important disparities, however, they are limited in their ability to identify processes relevant for Latino youth, as they have not included sufficient numbers of Latino youth from fairly homogeneous subgroups (e.g.  Puerto Ricans, Mexican- Americans, etc.) and lack information about acculturation, a key determinant of risk among Latino youth. We propose to conduct the fourth wave on the Boricua Youth Study (BYS~ R01 MH56401) focused on HIV/STI risk, infection in emerging adulthood (BYS Wave 4, N=1,992, youth ages 16 - 24). The BYS has already generated 3 waves of data (years 2001 to 2004) on children of Puerto Rican background (ages 5 -13 at Wave 1), with study findings described in 19 peer-reviewed publications to date. Besides the comprehensive longitudinal assessment strategy, a unique feature of the BYS is its two-site design, as it included children living in the South Bronx (SBx), NYC and San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR). At BYS Wave 4, we propose to conduct intensive assessment of HIV/STI risk (including testing for HIV and STIs) and enhance the assessment of SU/SUD, in addition to continuing tracking of cultural experiences, and psychiatric disorders and other factors. The proposed study has as its specific aims, to examine: (I) Prevalence of HIV/STI risk behaviors and rates of HIV/STI infection in emerging adulthood and the influence of sexual orientation, teenage unintended pregnancy and early sexual debut. (II) How development of SU/SUD (nicotine, alcohol, illicit/prescription drugs) starting in childhood/earlyadolescence may influence HIV/STI risk in emerging adulthood in the context of a  Ecodevelopmental framework. (III) The role of acculturation (cultural practices, identification, values) in relation to SU/SUD and its relationship to HIV/STI risk behaviors/infection.   Once Wave 4 is completed, the BYS will represent an unparalleled source of prospective information  about onset of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection  as well as persistence and progression of SU  from childhood to emerging adulthood in a homogeneous Latino subgroup examined in two contexts (SBx and  PR).This information will fill a gap in knowledge, and the model resulting from our investigation will enable and  facilitate the integration of specific factrs of relevance for Latino youth (e.g., acculturation) as part of  interventions for this high-risk group.

"Increasing the Pipeline: Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to increase the proportion of Latinos in cancer control research, particularly in the Southwestern U.S., by establishing a Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research (LTPCCR) that will motivate Latino master's-level students and health professionals to complete doctoral programs and careers as cancer control researchers. The LTPCCR is modeled after an evidence-based training model entitled, Minority Training Program in Cancer Control Research (MTPCCR) that targeted a spectrum of ethnic groups in California. Specifically, the LTPCCR will recruit an annual cohort of 20 Latino master's-level students or master's-trained health professionals. An innovation of the LTPCCR is that it targets a single ethnic minority - Latinos/Hispanics who will come from the Southwestern U.S. and Oklahoma. It will provide four interventions along the pipeline from masters-level to doctoral-level training, including: a) a Summer Institute for all participants, b) 9 annual paid summer internships in cancer disparities research (Y2-5), c) 3 annual Doctoral Application Support Awards and d) a Doctoral Student Retreat. Lastly, it will demonstrate an enrollment rate in doctoral programs that exceeds Latino enrollment achieved by the previous MTPCCR. We anticipate a minimum annual Latino enrollment of at least 15% (a 33% increase over that achieved by the MTPCCR). Additional we expect at least 50% of doctoral students reporting cancer control as their research focus and the majority of doctoral students indicating that the Texas program had a strong positive influence on these academic goals. Other benchmarks for success include a significant increase in self-efficacy and in participants' intention to apply to a doctoral program after attending the Summer Institute; and a minimum of 65% of participants rating each session as excellent.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite private and governmental support for programs that encourage Latinos to move through the pipeline from high school to college to research in basic sciences and medicine, there has been little investment in the social and behavioral sciences that send cancer control researchers out into communities to conduct epidemiologic, communication, and behavioral research. The goal of this program is to address these disparities by increasing the proportion of Latinos in cancer control research, particularly in the Southwestern U.S.           Despite private and governmental support for programs that encourage Latinos to move through the pipeline from high school to college to research in basic sciences and medicine, there has been little investment in the social and behavioral sciences that send cancer control researchers out into communities to conduct epidemiologic, communication, and behavioral research.

"Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino population has experienced a dramatic increase over the past decade, making it the largest minority group in the United States (US). Along with this surge in numbers Latinos also face greater challenges in accessing health care compared to the general population. These health disparities, which are particularly salient among Latina women, make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors that affect the disproportionate numbers of people suffering from HIV/AIDS and substance abuse in this population. Our long term goal is therefore to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventual elimination of HIV/AIDS and substance abuse health disparities among Latinos. The proposed Center will expand on the activities of our current P-20 NIMHD C-SALUD located at Florida International University (FlU). C-SALUD will focus its research, training, and community collaboration activities with Latinos in Miami-Dade County, a county that not only houses a high concentration of Latinos but also has the dubious distinction of having one of the highest rates of HIV, cocaine related deaths, and emergency room admissions in the U.S. The proposed continuing C-SALUD will build on ongoing collaborations with community based organizations which have a longstanding history of providing health and social services to Latinos at risk for HIV and substance abuse as well as other underserved Latino populations in South Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: Administrative, Research, Research Education /Training, and Community Partnership/Engagement. The target population will be Latinos, particularly Latina women residing in Miami-Dade County with a focus on Latina farm workers ages 18 and older and recent Latina immigrants who have lived in the U.S. less than one year, ages 18-23. These two Latino subgroups are at high risk for HIV and have been impacted by the HIV epidemic. We anticipate that partnerships between C-SALUD researchers and the Miami-Dade County Latino community, will lead to the development of new collaborative strategies for researchers, CBOs, and the Latino community at large to work together more effectively in reducing and eliminating HIV and substance abuse health disparities among Latinos.             The Center is expected to enhance our understanding of the role that social and cultural determinants of health have on the substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors of Latinos, particular Latinas. This knowledge is expected to lead to the development and refinement of culturally relevant and evidence-based HIV prevention strategies available to HIV-uninfected/infected individuals and users of substances among Latinos who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS and substance abuse epidemics in the U.S.",Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States,8473698,P20MD002288,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Cocaine ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Migrant Workers ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Development Plans ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Staging ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' cohort ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' flu ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 year old ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' doctoral student ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,P20,2013,1086126,0.07083353189704256
"Association of Acculturation with Type 2 Diabetes Risk Among US Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its long term sequelae are increasing in the US, particularly among Latinos. Latinos are at increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and develop T2D at younger ages and at a lower body weight index compared to non-Hispanic whites. For these reasons, Latinos have been identified as a NIDDK priority population with a NIDDK research agenda that includes both biologic, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors that affect T2D prevalence and complications. Acculturation is an important socio-cultural factor that may explain the disproportionate health burden of T2D among Latinos. Acculturation is defined as the process whereby an immigrant culture adopts the beliefs and practices of a host culture. There are limited studies of T2D risk factors and acculturation and how this relationship affects intermediary T2D processes and outcomes such as incident T2D and subclinical cardiovascular disease. The association between acculturation and T2D is inconsistent among Latinos in the published literature. This grant will study the association of acculturation with T2D risk and risk factors using data from multiple well- established epidemiologic NIH cohort studies using validated multidimensional acculturation scales that capture the complex domains of cultural values, beliefs, and behaviors of the acculturation process. The 5 cohorts are: San Antonio Heart Study, Sacramento Latino Study of Aging, Boston Area Community Health Survey, Dallas Heart Study and the Framingham Heart Study Omni Cohort. The simultaneous comparison of findings will maximize the potential for exploring whether the reported heterogeneity of prior study findings is due to differences in underlying Latino cohort characteristics, geographic differences in the process of acculturation in the US and/or differences in the measure of acculturation. Dr. Lopez's long-term goal is to become an independent patient-oriented researcher in diabetes care. Aided by advanced coursework in biostatistics and social epidemiology during the K23 award period, Dr. Lopez will acquire additional research skills and experience under the mentorship of nationally and internationally known researchers in a supportive academic environment. 1        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acculturation is an important socio-cultural factor that may explain the disproportionate health burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among Latinos. Understanding how acculturation impacts T2D risk factors and outcomes among Latinos will inform how best to tailor lifestyle and behavioral interventions and reduce health disparities. 2          ",Association of Acculturation with Type 2 Diabetes Risk Among US Latinos,8486887,K23DK098280,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Body Weight ', ' Boston ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Literature ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Physiology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' Immigrant ', ' apM1 (adipose-specific) protein ', ' apM-1 protein ', ' adipocyte, C1q and collagen domain containing protein ', ' adipocyte complement-related protein 30-kDa ', ' ACRP30 protein ', ' adiponectin ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Visceral ', ' subcutaneous ', ' waist circumference ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' diabetes risk ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' adipokines ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' obesity risk ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' public health relevance ', ' fasting glucose ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2013,185741,0.1251277926056329
"Cultural Adaptation of a Supportive Care Needs Measure for Latino Cancer Survivor     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To date there is a paucity of research and information on Latino male cancer survivors, who are part of the largest and fastest growing racial/ethnic minority group in the United States. Considering the long term treatment related side effects that deeply affect quality of life, and that Latinos are being diagnosed at younger ages, it is critical that we develop a better understanding of the supportive care needs of this at-risk population. Currently, there are few available data that provide information with regard to supportive care needs for developing and or adapting relevant interventions for Latino cancer male survivors. While several English- language instruments have been developed to assess supportive care needs of cancer survivors, such as the Cancer Survivor Unmet Needs measure (CaSUN), none have been culturally adapted for or validated among Latino Spanish speaking survivors. Guided by an ""emic-etic paradigm,"" this study will use an exploratory mixed method study design, which employs a series of iterative and group consensus-building approaches. A three phase iterative approach will be used to translate and adapt the CaSUN using the Cultural Equivalency Model for Translating and Adapting Instruments. This process also emphasized the use of conceptual, content semantic and technical equivalence techniques through all phases of the study. The specific aims are to 1) use qualitative methods to explore the supportive care needs of Latino male cancer survivors to inform the cultural adaption of the CaSUN, 2) adapt the Spanish language CaSUN using systematic and iterative methods, and 3) pilot test and provide initial evidence of validity and reliability of the translated and culturally adapted measure for Latino male cancer survivors. It is expected that study findings will inform an evidence-based approach for the cross-cultural adaptation of validated measures and add to the sparse literature on cancer survivorship among Latino men. Findings are expected to contribute to the existing science of cancer-related health disparities by providing a more in-depth understanding of the supportive care needs of Latino male cancer survivors, a rapidly growing group in the US. In terms of overall cancer survivorship significance, the study is expected to yield a measure that has had broad implications and application for future psych educational intervention that engage and support underserved cancer survivors in managing their illness and recovery.          Responding to the need to expand the development of instruments to describe and measure cancer survivor' recovery and to increase the ""knowledge base"" for the creation of interventions for underserved population, this R03 uses a series of systematic and iterative approaches to translate and culturally adapt a validated supportive care needs measure into Spanish for Latino cancer survivors.

"Salud y el Exito: Addressing Proven Factors in HIV Prevention for Latino Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Padres Unidos por la Salud y el ¿xito de Nuestros Hijos aims to support Latino parents and schools in their efforts to promote the healthy choices of children, with the goal of reducing behaviors that lead to elevated levels of HIV/AIDS in urban Latino communities. The study is designed to advance efforts to begin HIV prevention early, during the preteen and young adolescent years, before youth establish patterns of behavior that jeopardize their health and success, or ""Salud y ¿xito."" Salud y ¿xito draws on a solid foundation of theoretical and empirical research that underscores the importance of supporting the primary role that parents play in healthy youth development. The study will test a bilingual version of a multi-year parent-mediated intervention, Salud y ¿xito, with primary Spanish- as well as English-speaking Latino parents and youth. This intervention consists of parent education delivered through sets of audio-CDs to promote positive parenting practices, including monitoring, rule setting, communication, and support. In addition, Salud y ¿xito M s, an enhanced version of this parent-mediated approach, will be tested. This enhanced intervention integrates audio-CD parent education with a school-based parent involvement program, PALMS Tools for Latino Family Outreach. These tools facilitate the creation of welcoming environments that encourage parental involvement in their preteens' and young adolescents' academic success and future education planning. This is critical because Latinos experience the highest levels of school dropout and school failure, which are both consequences and risk factors for risky behaviors related to HIV/AIDS. Both intervention components have a common purpose: Promoting positive parenting practices known to foster resiliency and protect youth from risk. The specific aims are to: (1) Enroll and randomly assign 60 urban schools serving high proportions of Latino families to one of three conditions: (a) Salud y ¿xito multi-year parent education; (b) Salud y ¿xito M s parent education supplemented with PALMS; or a (c) comparison condition (health education print materials); (2) Enroll 1600 Latino families with youth from 6th grade classes in the study and conduct telephone parent surveys and youth classroom surveys at baseline; (3)Implement Salud y ¿xito intervention components at schools assigned to the intervention conditions; (4) Conduct youth surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions are effective in reducing risk behaviors and intentions and promoting school attachment and pro-social activities; (5) Conduct parent surveys at 3- and 15-month follow-ups to test whether the interventions promote and sustain positive parenting practices; (6) Examine how parenting practices and youth outcomes vary by individual and family characteristics, including gender as well as acculturation; and (7) Examine whether youth outcomes are explained by parenting practices and identify which parenting practices mediate the relationship between experimental condition and youth outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Salud y el �xito aims to support Latino parents and schools in their efforts to promote the academic success and healthy choices of children, with the goal of reducing behaviors that lead to elevated levels of HIV/AIDS in urban Latino communities. This innovative parent-mediated prevention program targets urban schools serving large numbers of Latino families, where high proportions of youth are sexually initiated before the age of 15, placing them at risk of HIV/AIDS and other negative health, educational, economic and social outcomes, including teen pregnancies, teen births, and school dropout.

"Effective Care of Latinos with Diabetes and Limited English Proficiency    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to PA-09-262: NIDDK: Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases. Ineffective diabetes care impacts patient well-being, health outcomes, health care costs and contributes to racial and ethnic disparities. Latinos have high rates of diabetes and well-documented disparities in diabetes care and outcomes. Factors recognized as contributing to disparities in diabetes outcomes for Latinos include lack of health insurance, financial barriers to accessing treatments, and limited English proficiency. Latinos with limited English proficiency (LEP) now constitute 44% of Latino adults. Health care systems are struggling to provide clinical care to Latinos with LEP and diabetes using either bilingual clinicians or interpreter services. The comparative effectiveness of these language access strategies with respect to clinical outcomes is not known. In a prior study, in a setting with uniform access to care and professional medical interpreters, we found that Latino patients with LEP were less likely to have poor glycemic control if they identified their physician as fluent in Spanish. We now propose to build on our work by examining multiple clinical outcomes using richly detailed data from a 5-year longitudinal cohort of Latinos enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California-Diabetes Registry. The overarching goals of this proposal are: to determine whether language proficiency is a root cause of diabetes disparities among Latinos; provide essential information on the comparative effectiveness of two strategies to overcome language barriers (bilingual clinicians versus professional medical interpreters); deepen understanding of how language barriers influence patient and physician behavior (medication adherence and clinical inertia); and determine if there are aspects of interpreter use that can be modified to improve the outcomes of language discordant care. Our results will inform health systems and clinicians seeking to improve diabetes care for Latinos with LEP and will provide a framework for intervention studies to reduce disparities for this population.        Latinos are the largest minority population in the US and have high and rising prevalence of diabetes and diabetes complications. Disparities between Latinos and whites in diabetes outcomes appear to be increasing. Limited English proficiency (LEP), which currently affects 44% of Latino adults, may contribute to less effective health care, but the role of language barriers in diabetes care is unclear. This observational study will use data from an insured patient population to examine whether LEP status is associated with disparities in diabetes outcomes among Latinos, and compare the effectiveness of two strategies for overcoming language barriers (language concordant (Spanish-speaking) physicians versus professional interpreters) and reducing disparities. Our overarching goal is to improve the quality of healthcare for Latinos with diabetes.

"Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) that will focus on reducing cardiovascular disease risk among Latinos in East Los Angeles, California (East L.A.). East L.A. is an urban community with high rates of obesity-related chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke. East L.A. is over 96% Latino; 85% of whom have Mexican ancestry and the rest come mainly from Central America. Our primary objective is to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in this under-served area. To accomplish this objective, we have three integrated, complementary projects, two cores, and a Training and Career Development Program. We will use a community-based participatory approach to implement family and neighborhood environment interventions, along with the collection of physiological data that will examine risk in individuals and across generations. The intervention components include several dimensions that affect health outcomes - personal & family factors, systems factors, and environmental factors. Project 1 is an intensive home environment intervention involving families, of which one member is a high-risk case newly enrolled in a local diabetes care clinic. Project 2 will examine vascular function and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers for individuals varying in generational and immigrant status, to increase the understanding of the basis for the Latino acculturation paradox in CVD risk. Project 3 will conduct make overs of comer stores to enable them to market and provide healthier food options, as well as enable them to serve as a venue for training community members about healthier food options and meal preparation strategies. The center will also capitalize on the inclusion of both promotoras and public health rookies in intervention activities. The public health rookies will be adolescents recruited from a public high school in the community. The two cores provide administrative and research methods resources to the projects, and the Training and Career Development Program will provide resources and infrastructure to provide a pipeline for the public health rookies and will train and mentor graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty on the use of interdisciplinary, disparities-reduction research.          ",Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.,8470700,P50HL105188,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Affect ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Central America ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Biochemical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Immigrant ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' data management ', ' field study ', ' high school ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' food preparation ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' environmental intervention ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' operation ', ' doctoral student ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2013,2897407,0.007238358968120095
"Developing a Community Empowered Intervention to Promote Latino Family Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last two decades, Latino population growth has exceeded that of all other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. This growth has been particularly striking in Oregon, the site of this study, and in 21 similar states with emerging immigrant communities. Rapid population growth, when combined with unprepared health and social service systems, can significantly contribute to Latino health disparities. Parenting practices have long been implicated as a key influence on family and child health. The proposed study involves collaboration between the University of Oregon's Center for Equity Promotion (CEQP) and Farmworker Housing Development Corporation (FHDC) and is designed in three phases: (1) collaboration advancement and community needs assessment (n = 95); (2) intervention development; and (3) intervention feasibility and initial efficacy trial {n= 120 families; 210 parents, 120 youth). The intervention would be delivered with Spanish-speaking Latino parents who live in FHDC housing developments and would focus on those malleable behaviors (e.g., parenting practices, stress management, healthy nutrition, and physical activity) that can promote Latino family health and youth well-being. The study's specific aims are: (1) to create a sustainable structure for ongoing, community-empowered research by building on our existing collaborative community partnership; (2) to identify key family-based health behaviors that confer risk for and protection against negative physical and behavioral health outcomes (e.g., overweight and obesity, respiratory illness, substance use, depression, and youth problem behaviors) among FHDC families, through a collaboratively designed and implemented mixed methods needs assessment; (3) to develop, refine, and manual-ize an intervention that adapts promising practices from community and evidence-based interventions shown to impact behavioral and physical health outcomes for immigrant Latino families, and emphasizes family resilience, strong parenting practices, and family health-promoting behaviors; and (4) to examine the feasibility and initial efficacy of the intervention in terms of promoting healthy famiy behaviors that reduce risk for negative physical and behavioral health outcomes.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): This community-based participatory research study aims to identify priority areas and malleable factors that, if positively influenced through an interventio targeting family health, could have broad ripple effects for reducing disease, including chronic conditions, among Latinos.

"A Church-Based, Self-Management Intervention for Mexican-Americans with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term research objective is to become a nationally respected, independent community-based researcher, with a specific focus on using faith-based interventions to reduce diabetes disparities among Latinos. Diabetes is a very prevalent and morbid condition affecting Latinos, especially Mexican-Americans in the United States. Many church-based interventions have shown promise improving health outcomes among minority populations; but data on church-based interventions for Latino populations is scarce. Considering that the church is a center of Latino family and culture, interventions based in churches has promise to have great impact on this population. To our knowledge, no other studies have focused on designing church-based interventions for Latinos with diabetes. My research to date has already allowed me accomplish many of my short-term objectives in my path to becoming an independent academic researcher. With the support from the career development award, I will have the opportunity to refine my skills in community-based research methods and design interventions to tackle health disparities and foster change in Latino communities. I have the following short-term goals over the next five years that I will focus on in this proposal: 1) To gain additional research training and skills; 2) To assess the facilitators and barriers of local healthcare providers in linking to church-based diabetes, self-management interventions; 3) To design a church-based, culturally-appropriate patient intervention in partnership with faith-based institutions and local healthcare institutions to increase self- management of Latino patients with diabetes; 4) To pilot the intervention among Latinos with diabetes with the goal of improving their diabetes outcomes. Considering the growth of the Hispanic population and their disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, developing community based programming and linking these programs to the local healthcare system is crucial to decrease the health disparities among Latinos and has promise to have a high impact on diabetes outcomes on this community.

"HIV treatment delays in Latinos: testing a model for social influence and trust     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of HIV-positive status and entry into treatment is the most efficacious way to prevent the spread and/or progression of the disease. However surveillance data and cohort studies indicate Latinos in the United States (U.S.) are more likely than non-Latino blacks and whites to delay testing, present to care with an AIDS defining illness, and die within one year of learning their HIV-positive status. Recent studies have shown that U.S. immigrants from Mexico and Central America are more likely to delay testing and treatment compared to other foreign-born groups; and Latinos in Southeastern settlement areas may delay seeking care longer than Latinos in more established immigrant destinations. Because time lived in the U.S. and acculturation are often associated with increased behavioral risk and suboptimal health outcomes among Latinos, it is important to understand how combinations of social influences may affect HIV-risk, socio-medical trust, and likelihood of HIV-testing over time.      The proposed research will apply Simons-Morton's Social Influences Model to test theoretical links between social influences, trust in medical providers, and likelihood of HIV testing among heterosexually active immigrant men and women. The proposed research uses data from three NIH and extramurally funded studies (2007 - 2009) to address three specific aims: (1) Assess validity of the WFU Physician Trust Scale among Spanish-speaking men and women from Mexico and Central America; (2) Estimate the structural relationships between sojourner social support, acculturative factors, and physician trust adjusting for length of residence in the U.S. and (3) Examine whether ""socio-medical trust"" moderates the HIV risk and testing relationships among men in the HoMBReS-2 HIV prevention intervention. The proposed research will advance theory and measurement of psychosocial processes in the most rapidly growing U.S. populations experiencing the most severe AIDS-related outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study addresses objectives of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the U.S. by examining theoretical links between social influences, acculturative factors, and likelihood of HIV-testing among heterosexually active immigrant men and women in the southeastern U.S. Using data from a NIH-funded HIV prevention intervention and two complementary studies (2007 - 2009) the Principal Investigator will examine how socio-medical trust and other psychosocial variables may affect HIV testing and treatment outcomes in emerging Latino communities.            ",HIV treatment delays in Latinos: testing a model for social influence and trust,8603567,F31MH102165,"['residence ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' care seeking ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Documentation ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' attributable fraction ', ' Population Attributable Risks ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' public health relevance ', ' nonmedical use ', ' surveillance data ', ' Regimen ', ' Accounting ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Central America ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Histoplasmosis ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Learning ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mexico ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' North Carolina ', ' Opportunistic Infections ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Self Medication ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxoplasma gondii Infection ', ' T. gondii infection ', ' Toxoplasmosis ', ' Translating ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' forest ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2013,30912,0.07982322776667482
"A Promotora Program to Prevent Primary Tooth Decay in Low-income Latino Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KDH Research & Communication (KDHRC) proposes to develop and evaluate Dientes Fuertes, Vida Sana (DFVS), a culturally-competent program to prevent primary tooth decay in low-income Latino children ages zero to six. To effectively reach low-income Latino children, DFVS will train promotores de salud (PS) at Latino-serving community-based organizations (CBOs) to conduct outreach to Latino parents and guardians to build their knowledge and skills in 1) oral health literacy, including proper brushing, flossing, ad feeding practices to prevent primary tooth decay; and 2) oral healthcare system navigation, which includes when, where, and how to seek dental care and treatment and methods to overcome barriers to dental care.  DFVS addresses a pressing public health need. Public health officials have called tooth decay a silent epidemic and the greatest unmet childhood health need. On an individual level, childhood tooth decay predicts lasting and substantive physical, psychosocial, and economic consequences. On a societal level, childhood tooth decay costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars yearly, due mostly to emergency room care for preventable tooth pain. DFVS matches this pressing public health need with the PS intervention model, which has demonstrated effectiveness, culturally-competency, and cost-efficiency. DFVS is unique in the field.  At the completion of this project, we will have the complete DFVS program, which will consist of four bilingual English/Spanish components: 1) a Training Guide (TG) for a CBO-based facilitator to conduct eight, two-hour sessions to prepare PS to conduct outreach to Latino guardians; 2) a multi-part training telenovela, or streaming video that dramatically illustrates Latino oral health challenges for PS learning and discussion; 3) an Implementation Guide (IG) to build CBOs' capacity to effectively use DFVS; and 4) a distribution website to host DFVS. What is more, we will have substantive data on DFVS's effectiveness as a culturally-competent program to prevent primary tooth decay in low-income Latino children ages zero to six. These data will stem from two sources. First, the feasibility evaluation will explore the extent to which DFVS is a useful, culturally- appropriate program that CBOs will adopt. It will also test how exposure to the DFVS prototype changes PS' knowledge, improve attitudes, and increase self-efficacy to conduct outreach to Latino guardians. Second, the outcome evaluation will test DFVS in a two group, multi-stage, controlled trial of DFVS's effectiveness when implemented by a group of CBOs. Taken together, DFVS and its evaluation results aim to reduce oral health disparities among low-income Latino children ages zero to six by creating an evidence-based, culturally- competent program to prevent primary tooth decay.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DFVS meets a pressing public health need. Public health officials have called tooth decay a silent epidemic and the greatest unmet childhood health need. Low-income Latino children are at particular risk of experiencing tooth decay and its lasting and substantive physical, psychosocial, and economic consequences. DFVS will address the costly public health problem of tooth decay in low-income Latino children using CBO- based PS as a culturally-competent method to build Latino guardians' knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions in oral health literacy and oral healthcare system navigation. DFVS will be the only program of its kind and it thereby innovatively meets calls for interventions to prevent tooth decay in this vulnerable population.            ",A Promotora Program to Prevent Primary Tooth Decay in Low-income Latino Children,8592738,R44DE023713,"['Age ', ' Attitude ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Market Research ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' United States ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Communication Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDCR,"KDH RESEARCH AND COMMUNICATION, INC.",R44,2013,169043,-0.001594444682514801
"Toda Promotora Clearinghouse: Supporting nonprofits' use of promotores    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this Fast Track Small Business Innovation Research application, submitted by KDH Research and Communication (KDHRC), is to develop and evaluate an online information clearinghouse to support community-based nonprofit organizations' (NPOs) use of promotores programs to provide health information to underserved Latinos. Promotores programs use community health workers (CHWs) to conduct outreach for health promotion, prevention, and medical treatment, and there is increasing evidence that they improve health outcomes. The proposed Toda Promotora Clearinghouse (TPC) will provide information on the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of promotores programs to Latino-serving NPOs. Through the provision of centralized, scientifically-based information, TPC will support NPOs in the effective use of promotores programs to increase positive health outcomes among the clients that they serve.  The need for TPC is significant. Latino populations experience health disparities, or detrimental differences in the presence of disease, health outcomes, and access to care. NPOs are often at the forefront of addressing health disparities because they are key providers of health services, particularly for Latinos that may seek community-based health care because of lack of insurance, language barriers, or distrust of the mainstream medical system. But the recent economic downturn and governmental funding cuts have strained the fiscal capacity of many NPOs, necessitating the development and implementation of low-cost, yet effective, service delivery approaches. One promising approach is the use of promotores programs, but there is a lack of systematic information available to NPOs about their optimal formulation, implementation, and evaluation. Therefore, TPC aims to improve Latino health outcomes by increasing the health delivery capacity of Latino-serving NPOs through a clearinghouse of evidence-based information on establishing effective or improving existing promotores programs.  In Phase I of TPC we will conduct extensive formative research with a panel of experts in the field and NPO directors. We will then develop a TPC prototype and conduct a feasibility evaluation using a pretest/post test control group design. The evaluation will to examine the extent to which the TPC prototype changes knowledge, attitudes, and self-efficacy about promotores programming in a group of NPO directors.  In Phase II, we will finalize TPC by developing additional content and features for the website. We will then conduct an outcome evaluation that will include two studies. The first study will use similar methodology to the feasibility evaluation. The second evaluation will be a process study of how and to what extent NPOs and their directors use TPC and how its use impacts promotores programmatic outcomes. Together, the two evaluations will provide information for the commercialization of TPC and a wealth of data for publishing.        TPC will significantly impact public health in two ways. First, TPC will provide a publicly available, centralized source of evidence-based, practical information on effective promotores programming. Such a resource will allow nonprofit organizations (NPOs) to maximize their funding and not ""reinvent the wheel"" to formulate, implement, and evaluate promotora programs. The ultimate result of TPC will be increased use of effective health outreach programs by NPOs using promotores programs and, subsequently, improved health outcomes for Latinos. Second, the TPC project will generate significant primary data on health delivery by NPO health organizations that serve Latinos. By analyzing these data and disseminating our research results through multiple sources, we will contribute to the scientific literature on NPO effectiveness, promotores programs, and health outreach overall. The innovation of TPC lies in its ability to meet the documented need for systematic, widely disseminated, and replicable information on the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of promotores programs.

"Life Course Socioeconomics, Acculturation, & Type-2 Diabetes Risk Among Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the US carry a disproportionate burden of type-2 diabetes. Research has implicated life course socioeconomic position as a major factor in the development of chronic diseases, such as type-2 diabetes; yet most evidence is limited to non-Hispanic White populations. We hypothesize that the large disparities in type-2 diabetes among Latinos reflects the joint effect of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic factors, cultural characteristics, behaviors, biology, and other risk factors accumulating over the life course. The experience of Latinos in the US represents an especially fruitful context in which to investigate the influence of life course socioeconomic and cultural resources in relation to type-2 diabetes. In addition to being the fastest growing minority population with high rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes, the experience of Latinos is one that includes first generation immigrants with limited education and job skills, and later generations who are born and raised in the US and show varying levels of acculturation and assimilation, behavioral change, and socioeconomic advancement. With these unique considerations in mind, the present study seeks to: (1) examine the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; (2) assess whether acculturation modifies the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; and 3) examine whether metabolic and inflammatory markers related to behavioral, physiological, and psychosocial risk factors mediate the relationships between life course socioeconomic position, acculturation, and type-2 diabetes among Latinos. The proposed research activity will constitute the first systematic attempt to assess the unique and synergistic contributions of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type 2 diabetes among Latinos. By assessing life course exposures across two generations of Latinos living in the US, this project provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify targets for early intervention for reducing the heavy burden of type-2 diabetes among Latinos. More broadly, the proposed research may uncover crucial life course socioeconomic and cultural patterning of risk factors or health promoting characteristics that may also benefit other race/ethnic minorities disproportionately living in poverty and suffering from type-2 diabetes.         The proposed study will assess the impact of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type-2 diabetes and examine potential biological mediators, including inflammation, among two generations of US Latinos. The findings from this study will have important public health implications, including identification of critical risk facors and biological mechanisms mediating the effects of life course sociocultural contexts on type-2 diabetes across generations of US Latinos.","Life Course Socioeconomics, Acculturation, & Type-2 Diabetes Risk Among Latinos",8825045,R01DK087864,[''],NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2013,178340,0.14100549039206767
"Reducing Barriers to Autism Care in Latino Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis improves long-term child development and families' ability to cope with this disorder. Latino children are diagnosed with ASDs at older ages and at the point of more severe symptoms, putting them and their families at significant disadvantage. Interventions addressing family, community, and health care systems factors hold promise for improving access to ASD diagnostic services for minority children. The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to reduce ethnic differences in ASD care among Latinos. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a survey of 350 Latino parents of either typically-developing children or children with ASDs, to assess common beliefs about autism in Latino communities, and to assess which community factors, health beliefs, and health care system factors are associated with delays in ASD diagnosis. The survey will be conducted at three sites within the Autism Treatment Network: Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon; University of Colorado/The Children's Hospital in Denver; and University of Pennsylvania/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Based on the barriers found in the survey, we will develop a pilot community-based patient navigator intervention designed to reduce barriers to care. This research will be incorporated into a career development plan that includes increasing the Principal Investigator's knowledge and skills in the areas of autism diagnosis and treatment, mental health disparities, interventional study design, and community-based research. The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and used as the basis for an NIH-funded proposal to conduct a multi-site test of the intervention designed in this project. Over 120,000 U.S. Latino children have been diagnosed with an ASD, a figure that likely underestimates the true prevalence. This project will help such children achieve earlier diagnosis and better long-term prognosis.          The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to improve rates of early diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders in Latino children. We will achieve this goal through surveying Latino parents to identify barriers to care and then developing a pilot patient navigator intervention designed to reduce the barriers that we identified. This research will be incorporated into a career development plan that includes increasing the Principal Investigator's knowledge and skills in the areas of autism diagnosis and treatment, mental health disparities, interventional study design, and community-based research.

"Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance Abstract  The purpose of the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA) is to ameliorate the lack of highly qualified first-generation-educated Latino graduates prepared to engage in graduate degrees in health disparities research in both biomedical and health science-related disciplines. Latinos have been and continue to be gravely underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social science disciplines. In 2009 Latinos made up fewer than 5% of all medical scientists, despite being 15.8% of the US population, the largest minority group. Although Latinos represent a growing proportion of college admissions, they continue to lag behind in enrollment and degree completion (Becerra 2010). Entry-level science courses (e.g. chemistry, biology) tend to eliminate Latinos students from advancement in science degrees. In response to this critical educational deficit, and with support from the NIMHD Science Education Initiative, the NCLR/CSULB Center for Latino Community Health, Evaluation, and Leadership Training, will develop the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA).  HOLA will provide health disparities research training and tutoring in science to Latino students in their sophomore and junior years, thus widening the pool of minority applicants for advanced degrees. Moreover, HOLA will be open to students across the natural and health sciences reaching out to pre-health majors who otherwise would not be eligible to participate in existing research opportunities.  HOLA will provide 140 Latino undergraduate students and 30 minority graduate students with educational, mentoring, and career development opportunities designed to facilitate careers in health disparities research through the delivery of: 1) targeted undergraduate tutoring in diverse science courses for Latino pre-health and health science students; 2) workshops in health disparities research methods; 3) health disparities seminars highlighting population-specific issues; and, 4) an annual health disparities conference.

"A Randomized Clinical Trial Of Culturally Tailored MI     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the priority area Treatment for Health Disparities/Special Populations. Epidemiological and psychosocial research indicates that Latinos suffer greater adverse effects from hazardous drinking compared to other racial/ethnic groups, including higher rates of cirrhosis fatality and alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes. Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer alcohol-related health disparities, are less likely to initiate and to remai in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with high density of alcohol outlets. However, research on the field is challenged by the lack of studies comparing tailored to non-tailored treatments. We have pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905) demonstrating that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers. This study will be the basis for the current proposed study, which is a larger scale version of the pilot. The key modification was to incorporate social stressors in the context of acculturation. Thus, in the proposed study, we will also explore acculturation stress as an influence on the relationship between acculturation and alcohol consumption behavior. The public health impact of this study will be to develop a program of early screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous drinking among Latinos in communities that may lack such services. By providing early screening and intervention, we hope to minimize the burden of illness and social consequences that disproportionately affect Latino communities. Study Design: 357 Latino men and women who meet criteria for hazardous drinking (> 5/occasion for men, >4/occasion for women) will be recruited from the community. Following informed consent, they will complete a baseline assessment in either Spanish or English, and will then be randomized to receive either un-tailored motivational intervention (MI) or a culturally-tailored motivational intervention (CTMI). Participant randomization will be balanced by language preference, gender, alcohol severity, acculturation stress, and negative consequences, to ensure there is equivalent representation in each cell. Participants will be contacted by research assistants unaware of treatment assignment at 2, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Primary Aim 1: It is hypothesized that those randomized to receive the tailored treatment will report fewer alcohol- related negative consequences and fewer heavy drinking days at follow-up vs. those randomized to receive the un-tailored treatment. Primary Aim 2: Explore acculturation stress as a moderator of alcohol treatment outcomes. Long term goals: Develop a model of care that is easily disseminated in the community, and to generate theoretically-informed hypotheses to better understand how acculturation stress and processes confer risk for increased drinking among Latinos. We expect that this project will contribute needed knowledge about the role of acculturation stress in alcohol drinking behavior and treatment response.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer a greater burden of alcohol-related health disparities and negative social consequences compared to other racial/ethnic groups, are less likely to initiate and to remain in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with a high density of alcohol outlets. Pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905), which will serve as the basis for the current proposed larger-scale study, demonstrated that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers.

"Health Communication & Health Literacy to Improve Care for Latinos with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes disparities are common for Latino patients. Effective health communication can potentially narrow these disparities. This proposal details a career development plan that will prepare the principal investigator (PI) for success as an independent investigator with expertise in diabetes-related outcomes, health communication, and delivery of behavioral interventions for Latino diabetes patients. As an Internal Medicine- Pediatrics physician, with training in clinical investigation, the PI will gain new skills through this K23 in the areas of health disparities specific to diabetes care, enhanced Latino cultural competency, audio taping clinical encounters to assess the quality and role of health communication, and the development of a new training program for medical interpreters. The PI's immediate goals are to rigorously examine the quality of health communication between Latino diabetes patients, providers, and Spanish interpreters and the association between health communication and various diabetes-related health outcomes. To meet this goal, the PI has proposed a rigorous career development plan that incorporates additional didactic course work, regular participation in local and national meetings/seminars, a mentored research experience, and active involvement in an extremely supportive research environment. This includes an NIDDK funded Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC), NCRR-funded Meharry Clinical and Translational Research Center (MeTRC), Vanderbilt Program on Effective Health Communication (EHC), and an RCMI-funded Bioinformatics Core. The research specific aims are to: 1) conduct a cross-sectional, descriptive mixed-methods analysis of the quality of health communication between providers and Latino diabetes patients with particular emphasis on the role of the Spanish medical interpreter during language discordant encounters, and explore the association between baseline quality of health communication and various diabetes related health outcomes, 2) conduct an observational cohort study to examine the independent effect of provider health communication training and the use of a Spanish, literacy-sensitive educational toolkit on the quality of health communication during medical encounters, and assess the association between changes in the quality of health communication at 12 months with changes in diabetes related health outcomes, and 3) develop and pilot in a small RCT, an enhanced training program for Spanish medical interpreters geared toward improving their ability to work with providers and patients with LEP and limited health literacy during language discordant encounters. Overall, this K23 program will provide important insights into the nature of health communication with Latinos, the role of Spanish interpreters in this process, and most importantly prepare the PI for independent investigation of the role of effective health communication in addressing disparities in care for Latinos with diabetes.

"Partners for Strong, Healthy Families (PSHF)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos are a population at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases and use of substances. Latino youth are 2.8 times more likely to contract chlamydia, 2.2 times more likely to contract gonorrhea, 2.1 times more likely to contract syphilis (CDC, 2010) and have a higher rate of HPV infection, when compared to Whites. Latino 8th and 10th graders are also more likely than their White or Black peers to report lifetime past-year or past-month use of marijuana, cocaine, crack, and hallucinogens (Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2010). To date, efforts have been insufficient to reduce this disparity. But few studies have addressed multiple risks occurring concomitantly or independently by  engaging Latino families, youth and the community together in all aspects of intervention development. This community-based participatory research (CBPR) between the University of Southern California (USC) and Bienestar Health Services (BHS) aims to correct this inequity by including vulnerable Latino youth (16-21 years of age), families and the community to identity local needs, select, implement and test a pilot intervention in Los Angeles. We seek to  empower Latino families, youth, and community gate keepers in the discovery of culturally grounded intervention/s that optimally address complex-multiple risk processes resulting in serious inequities among Latino youth. Our aims are: 1) to establish a coalition -Partners for Strong Healthy Families (PSHF)- led by a Community Advisory Board (CAB) (community gatekeepers, parents, youths, Latino organizations) to engage in CBPR; collect data among 898 participants using qualitative and quantitative methods (needs assessment (n=400), an environmental scan in the selected community, 8 focus groups (n=96), key informant interviews (n=20), group model-building (GMB) via 6 small group meetings (n=120)) to identify community priorities and preferences; pilot test the resulting culturally tailored- language specific intervention (n=130 pr and 110 post test) that will provide detailed strategies to boost protective factors and reduce ris for engaging in early sex and substance use, strengthening Latino families; and evaluate the PSHF partnership and CAB on adherence to CBPR principles (n=22). An experienced CBPR team is committed to engaging Latino families, youth and community from conceptualization through dissemination in the discovery of new effective treatments and prevention strategies to address these complex multiple risk behaviors and reduce disparities.  RELEVANCE (See instructions): In adolescent health, sexual risk and substance use are among the most difficult problems for families to address with their children. This CBPR study is directly relevant to discovering community based-culturally tailored intervention/s that reveal optimal ways to engage families, youth and communities; leads to the emergence of new effective strategies for treatment and prevention against multifactorial risk behaviors (sex & drugs and empowers Latinos to set their own cultural pathways to reduce these complex inequities.

"Preventing violence and racial disparities for Latino youth     DESCRIPTION: This project uses Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) to address health disparities related to violence exposure among Latino youth. An important objective of the proposal is to address a significant gap in prevention science and health disparities research, by forming an academic-community partnership focused on preventing youth violence and reducing the prevalence of subsequent problem outcomes associated with violence exposure that pose a significant public health burden for Latino youth. The specific aims are to: (1) build a strong community-academic partnership to assess community needs and priorities for violence prevention through effective collaboration, shared responsibility and equity in decision-making among researchers, community agencies, and key community stakeholders; (2) identify local conditions related to experiences of violence, acculturative stress, discrimination, and other related factors to document, and highlight the Latino community's view of its own health problems related to violence and its negative effect on children and adolescents; (3) jointly sponsor meetings that address local conditions in order to heighten the community's awareness of health disparities related to violence exposure, disseminate relevant violence prevention information that stems from current research findings using both national and local data; and (4) develop and submit collaborative proposals for a CBPR intervention project to reduce/prevent violence among Latino youth. To accomplish these aims, we will build upon and strengthen existing collaborations with academic, community-based organizations, and community members. The collaborative partners and community stakeholders have identified addressing youth violence as a high priority. We will develop an advisory board and engage them in CBPR training. We will collaboratively conduct extensive formative work, including qualitative interviews and focus groups with community stakeholders, to assess priorities and potential strategies for addressing youth violence prevention. We will engage youth using photovoice, a strength-based methodology using cameras to allow participants to take a central role in assessment of their lives and communities in a flexible and accessible manner, suitable across age groups, and for the purpose of critical dialogue and reflection, and ultimately, community organization towards social action. We will invite local and national experts to engage in a reciprocal exchange of knowledge with our advisory board and with the community-at-large, through community forums. We will assess the success of the partnership in terms of the collaborative process, efficiency, empowerment, and satisfaction, and seek additional funds for a CBPR intervention project focused on community-based youth violence prevention. The community-academic partnership and infrastructure developed during this process will allow us to continue to collaborate in addressing health disparities facing Latin youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Violence exposure poses a major problem for Latino youth in the United States. Violence exposure and its negative health and mental health sequelae represent a racial disparity, occurring at disproportionately higher rates among Latino youth when compared with their non-Hispanic White counterparts.

"HIV treatment delays in Latinos: testing a model for social influence and trust     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early detection of HIV-positive status and entry into treatment is the most efficacious way to prevent the spread and/or progression of the disease. However surveillance data and cohort studies indicate Latinos in the United States (U.S.) are more likely than non-Latino blacks and whites to delay testing, present to care with an AIDS defining illness, and die within one year of learning their HIV-positive status. Recent studies have shown that U.S. immigrants from Mexico and Central America are more likely to delay testing and treatment compared to other foreign-born groups; and Latinos in Southeastern settlement areas may delay seeking care longer than Latinos in more established immigrant destinations. Because time lived in the U.S. and acculturation are often associated with increased behavioral risk and suboptimal health outcomes among Latinos, it is important to understand how combinations of social influences may affect HIV-risk, socio-medical trust, and likelihood of HIV-testing over time.      The proposed research will apply Simons-Morton's Social Influences Model to test theoretical links between social influences, trust in medical providers, and likelihood of HIV testing among heterosexually active immigrant men and women. The proposed research uses data from three NIH and extramurally funded studies (2007 - 2009) to address three specific aims: (1) Assess validity of the WFU Physician Trust Scale among Spanish-speaking men and women from Mexico and Central America; (2) Estimate the structural relationships between sojourner social support, acculturative factors, and physician trust adjusting for length of residence in the U.S. and (3) Examine whether ""socio-medical trust"" moderates the HIV risk and testing relationships among men in the HoMBReS-2 HIV prevention intervention. The proposed research will advance theory and measurement of psychosocial processes in the most rapidly growing U.S. populations experiencing the most severe AIDS-related outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study addresses objectives of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy for the U.S. by examining theoretical links between social influences, acculturative factors, and likelihood of HIV-testing among heterosexually active immigrant men and women in the southeastern U.S. Using data from a NIH-funded HIV prevention intervention and two complementary studies (2007 - 2009) the Principal Investigator will examine how socio-medical trust and other psychosocial variables may affect HIV testing and treatment outcomes in emerging Latino communities.            ",HIV treatment delays in Latinos: testing a model for social influence and trust,8696668,F31MH102165,"['Accounting ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Cells ', ' Central America ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Histoplasmosis ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Learning ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mexico ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' North Carolina ', ' Opportunistic Infections ', ' Physicians ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Self Medication ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Southeast US ', ' Southeast U.S. ', ' Southeastern United States ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Toxoplasma gondii Infection ', ' T. gondii infection ', ' Toxoplasmosis ', ' Translating ', ' tuberculous spondyloarthropathy ', ' infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis ', ' disseminated tuberculosis ', ' disseminated TB ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection ', ' Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection ', ' Mtb infection [{C0041296}] ', ' MTB infection ', ' M.tuberculosis infection ', ' M. tuberculosis infection ', ' Tuberculosis ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Destinations ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' forest ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Measurement ', ' Disease Progression ', ' T4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' CD4+ Counts ', ' CD4+ Cell Counts ', ' CD4 Lymphocyte Count ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' care seeking ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Documentation ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' attributable fraction ', ' Population Attributable Risks ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' public health relevance ', ' nonmedical use ', ' surveillance data ', ' Regimen ', ' ']",NIMH,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,31356,0.07982322776667482
"Increasing Water Intake In Lieu of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages among Latino Youth     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, ""Increasing Water Intake In Lieu of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages among Latino Youth,"" is a three-year proposal in response to PA-12-102 R13 Academic-Community Partnership Conference Series. The overall objective of this proposal is to enhance an existing academic-community partnership that will inform priorities for an intervention to increase intake of tap water in lieu of SSBs among Latino children and adolescents. Drinking water instead of SSBs can reduce children's total daily caloric intake thereby reducing obesity. This issue is of particular significance among Latino youth as they are more likely to drink SSBs and less likely to drink tap water than White and Asian children. To date, few interventions have focused on increasing water intake among children and there have been no interventions that have focused on increasing tap water intake among Latino children. For the past five years, researchers at the University Of California (CA) at San Francisco and the Atkins Center for Weight and Health at Berkeley in conjunction with nutrition advocates at the CA Food Policy Advocates have collaborated to improve drinking water access and intake in CA public schools. During a March 2012 convening, local, state, and national stakeholders prioritized a need for the development and evaluation of school-based interventions that promote intake of tap water instead of SSBs among populations most at risk for obesity. Support from this grant will allow us to build on this recent meeting and augment partnerships with community-based organizations from the CA Central Valley, an agricultural region with a large low-income, Latino population, to address disparities in beverage intake among Latino youth. Community-partnerships are essential to addressing such inequities. Specific activities for the academic-community partnership will include 1) bringing together a group of diverse stakeholders representing broad domains of research, policy, and community, 2) development of a memorandum of understanding to codify the partnership, 3) bimonthly meetings to clarify and delineate stakeholders' priorities for a school-based intervention focused on increasing tap water intake instead of SSBs among Latino children and adolescents, and 4) regular dissemination events to the broader community (i.e., national expert presentations, reports of local research study findings and board progress, case studies of innovative school practices, and methods workshops relevant to the community [e.g., drinking water testing, photovoice]). At the end of the three-year period, the academic-community partnership will produce the following products: development of an R01 application to examine the effect of a school-based intervention to promote tap water intake on obesity among Latino children and adolescents, submission of at least three peer-reviewed manuscripts, attainment of funded grant proposals, and introduction of relevant legislation.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Drinking water instead of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) can reduce childhood obesity. Even though Latino youth are more likely to be obese and to drink SSBs than their non-Latino peers, there is very limited research in this area. Such investigation is critical in designing and implementing interventions and policies to encourage intake of water instead of sugary drinks among Latino children. This conference will help provide direction for research on this topic.

"A Church-Based, Self-Management Intervention for Mexican-Americans with Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My long-term research objective is to become a nationally respected, independent community-based researcher, with a specific focus on using faith-based interventions to reduce diabetes disparities among Latinos. Diabetes is a very prevalent and morbid condition affecting Latinos, especially Mexican-Americans in the United States. Many church-based interventions have shown promise improving health outcomes among minority populations; but data on church-based interventions for Latino populations is scarce. Considering that the church is a center of Latino family and culture, interventions based in churches has promise to have great impact on this population. To our knowledge, no other studies have focused on designing church-based interventions for Latinos with diabetes. My research to date has already allowed me accomplish many of my short-term objectives in my path to becoming an independent academic researcher. With the support from the career development award, I will have the opportunity to refine my skills in community-based research methods and design interventions to tackle health disparities and foster change in Latino communities. I have the following short-term goals over the next five years that I will focus on in this proposal: 1) To gain additional research training and skills; 2) To assess the facilitators and barriers of local healthcare providers in linking to church-based diabetes, self-management interventions; 3) To design a church-based, culturally-appropriate patient intervention in partnership with faith-based institutions and local healthcare institutions to increase self- management of Latino patients with diabetes; 4) To pilot the intervention among Latinos with diabetes with the goal of improving their diabetes outcomes. Considering the growth of the Hispanic population and their disproportionate burden of chronic diseases, developing community based programming and linking these programs to the local healthcare system is crucial to decrease the health disparities among Latinos and has promise to have a high impact on diabetes outcomes on this community. With support from the K23 award, I can improve my skills in community based research and work towards my goal of becoming an independent academic researcher with an expertise in applying community based methods in decreasing Latino disparities in diabetes through faith-based interventions.

"Sobadors in the Health Care Utilization of Mexican Americans and Immigrants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Limited access to conventional health care providers increases the health risk of Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants and contributes to health disparities.  Latinos are less likely to have health insurance or a consistent healthcare provider than the general population, and they often work in occupations that place them at elevated risk for musculoskeletal pain and injuries, contributing to health disparities.  Few studies have examined how Latinos make decisions regarding whether to access conventional care or traditional care, including the use of sobadors, in new immigrant communities.  Sobadors are traditional healers who draw upon Mexican healing practices such as massage and therapeutic maneuvers to treat musculoskeletal pain and disorders perceived to be related to abdominal organs. Information about sobador use is limited-however, it suggests that sobador use is widespread.  This research will (1) delineate factors that affect Latino participants'  use of sobadors, including predisposing characteristics, enabling resources, and need, as reported by Latinos  who reside in NC, (2) delineate the health beliefs of sobadors and the strategies they use to diagnose patient  health conditions, and identify strategies sobadors use to treat patients' health conditions as recorded through  sobador interviews and video recorded treatments, and (3) delineate how Latinos' predisposing characteristics,  enabling resources, and need affect integration, or lack thereof, of sobador and conventional care use, as  reported by Latinos who reside in NC.  The Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations guides the research design and analysis.  Semi-structured in-depth interviews will be conducted with 24 Latino patients living in NC.   Patient participants will be restricted to individuals aged 18 and older who used a sobador during the previous two years.  Six sobadors will also be interviewed.  Sobador treatment sessions with 24 patients will be video recorded-sobadors will subsequently explain the recorded activity.  All interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed, and translated.  A computer-assisted, systematic analysis procedure will be used to delineate and compare the factors that affect Latino participants' use of sobadors and conventional health care and to delineate the health beliefs and practices of sobadors.  A chiropractor trained in manipulation, mobilization, and massage techniques will carefully examine the videotapes and evaluate the techniques performed.  These results will provide the foundation for an R01 application in which primary data will be collected to examine frequency of use of sobadors and conventional care providers to treat specific symptoms among US Latinos, the effect of sobador-provided treatments on Latinos' well-being, and strategies that increase Latino access to conventional providers when allopathic care is indicated.             PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about how Latino Americans and Latino immigrants make decisions regarding use of sobadors, traditional healers who provide massage and therapeutic maneuvers to treat musculoskeletal problems and disorders perceived to be related to organs in the abdominal region.

"The Primary Care Medical Home and Preventive Service Use in Latino Immigrants     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CANDIDATE: I am proposing to study how certain features of the Primary Care Medical Home (PCMH) impact the utilization of recommended preventive health services by Latino Immigrants. I will build upon my broad clinical and health policy background, using expert mentors and local research training opportunities to develop into an independent health services researcher. RESEARCH FOCUS: Latino immigrants, a rapidly growing segment of our population, underutilize routine preventive health care. Some features of the PCMH have been associated with increased utilization in some vulnerable populations, but little objective, multi-facility data exists to address the effects of these changs on Latino immigrants. The Oregon Community Health Information Network (OCHIN) is a multiple-facility linked electronic medical record that contains data capable of filling this knowledge gap. This proposal expands on existing PCMH research, and proposes to use the OCHIN Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to evaluate the association between certain PCMH principles and preventive service use in Latino immigrants. TRAINING GOALS: My training goals include (1) developing his skills in research design, analysis, and interpretation with a focus on the use of large databases to study vulnerable populations and 2) expanding my knowledge and experience in the strategies for and practice of health disparities research. ENVIRONMENT: I will undergo his career development in the Department of Family Medicine at Oregon Health Science University and through the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, two organizations with significant and longstanding resources for early-career researchers. METHODS: (1) Cross-sectional analysis of Latino immigrants in the OCHIN EHR data and their rates of utilization of lipid screening, cervical cancer screening, and pneumococcal vaccination. (2) Retrospective cohort analysis of the association between certain features of the PCMH and these preventive services in Latino immigrants. OUTCOMES: I will measure the rates of preventive service use in Latino immigrants cared for in OCHIN clinics and compare these to rates of other populations in OCHIN. I will test how select features of the PCMH will affect the rate of utilization of lipid screening, cervical cancer screening, and pneumococcal vaccination in Latino immigrants.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide valuable information for medical providers and policy makers as they attempt to finance, organize, and provide routine preventive health care for low-income individuals in our communities. Specifically, our community health centers will benefit from this information as they provide preventive health care with limited resources.            ",The Primary Care Medical Home and Preventive Service Use in Latino Immigrants,8699196,K08HS021522,[''],AHRQ,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K08,2014,147626,0.0860180805166374
"Optimizing Educational Video Designs to Improve Minority Organ Donor Registration  Abstract The U.S. organ donation system remains in a perpetual state of crisis. Over 115,000 patients in the U.S. are waiting for organ transplants, and the waitlist increases by several thousand annually despite over 10,000 dying or becoming too sick to receive a transplant. Latinos are disproportionally affected by this organ crisis due to their higher prevalence of diabetes and end-stage renal disease from inadequate access to treatment. Of the 115,000 waiting, over 95,000 require kidneys, and of these, 19.2% are Latino despite Latinos comprising only 16.7% of the U.S. population. Latinos also comprise 15.8% of recipients but only 13.1% of donors. These rates remain well below the disproportionate need since organs best match when donors and recipients are of similar race. We will investigate means for improving organ donor registration among Latinos using educational videos about uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCDD) produced and distributed in partnership with our network of Latino owned barbershops and beauty parlors. uDCDD programs consider candidates for donation no matter timing or location of death, so long as consideration occurs after all life sustaining efforts are exhausted. Video content will include live footage from uDCDD programs in Spain, which has markedly improved rates of kidney transplantation compared to the U.S. If successful, we estimate that uDCDD programs could provide 22,000 more donation opportunities annually in the U.S. Educational models will inform the design of our uDCDD videos to test how genre (expert testimonials, documentary with live uDCDD footage) and ending choices (uplifting, negative consequences, unresolved) impact immediate registration after viewing. Our proposal is a 3-phase qualitative and quantitative research design that includes an intervention development phase using qualitative interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos (Aim 1); a 2x3 randomized controlled trial, in which we will randomize customers to receive one of six videos delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered through registration online or with a mail application (Aim 2); and a failure analysis whereby we will interview some of the participants from the randomized trial who failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain their reasons (Aim 3). This research will provide a model for future studies, in which we will modify our videos based on our research findings and distribute them in Latino-owned barbershops and beauty parlors using large screen TVs or interactive kiosks. Through this work, we hope to reduce organ transplantation disparities through increased registration among Latinos who comprise a group having a disproportionally greater need for kidney transplants. ! PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will use educational videos to inspire increased organ donor registration among Dominicans and Puerto Ricans who visit Latino owned barbershops and beauty parlors, a community setting where we have previously shown with our cardiovascular health promotion and cancer prevention research constitutes a unique peer network that can be utilized to promote healthy behavior for customers. Videos will present how uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD) programs that consider candidates for donation no matter timing or location of death, so long as consideration occurs after all life sustaining efforts are exhausted, are promising means for solving the organ donation crisis for Latinos, a population with disproportionally greater need.

"Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a UCLA-USC Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) that will focus on reducing cardiovascular disease risk among Latinos in East Los Angeles, California (East L.A.). East L.A. is an urban community with high rates of obesity-related chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and stroke. East L.A. is over 96% Latino; 85% of whom have Mexican ancestry and the rest come mainly from Central America. Our primary objective is to reduce cardiovascular disease risk in this under-served area. To accomplish this objective, we have three integrated, complementary projects, two cores, and a Training and Career Development Program. We will use a community-based participatory approach to implement family and neighborhood environment interventions, along with the collection of physiological data that will examine risk in individuals and across generations. The intervention components include several dimensions that affect health outcomes - personal & family factors, systems factors, and environmental factors. Project 1 is an intensive home environment intervention involving families, of which one member is a high-risk case newly enrolled in a local diabetes care clinic. Project 2 will examine vascular function and cardiovascular disease risk biomarkers for individuals varying in generational and immigrant status, to increase the understanding of the basis for the Latino acculturation paradox in CVD risk. Project 3 will conduct make overs of comer stores to enable them to market and provide healthier food options, as well as enable them to serve as a venue for training community members about healthier food options and meal preparation strategies. The center will also capitalize on the inclusion of both promotoras and public health rookies in intervention activities. The public health rookies will be adolescents recruited from a public high school in the community. The two cores provide administrative and research methods resources to the projects, and the Training and Career Development Program will provide resources and infrastructure to provide a pipeline for the public health rookies and will train and mentor graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and faculty on the use of interdisciplinary, disparities-reduction research.          ",Family and Neighborhood Interventions to Reduce Heart Disease Risk in East L.A.,8604728,P50HL105188,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Affect ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Central America ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Leadership ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Marketing ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Biochemical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Immigrant ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' programs ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' data management ', ' field study ', ' high school ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' food preparation ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' training project ', ' Data ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Preparation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' environmental intervention ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' operation ', ' doctoral student ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,P50,2014,2607776,0.007238358968120095
"Reducing Barriers to Autism Care in Latino Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis improves long-term child development and families' ability to cope with this disorder. Latino children are diagnosed with ASDs at older ages and at the point of more severe symptoms, putting them and their families at significant disadvantage. Interventions addressing family, community, and health care systems factors hold promise for improving access to ASD diagnostic services for minority children. The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to reduce ethnic differences in ASD care among Latinos. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a survey of 350 Latino parents of either typically-developing children or children with ASDs, to assess common beliefs about autism in Latino communities, and to assess which community factors, health beliefs, and health care system factors are associated with delays in ASD diagnosis. The survey will be conducted at three sites within the Autism Treatment Network: Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon; University of Colorado/The Children's Hospital in Denver; and University of Pennsylvania/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Based on the barriers found in the survey, we will develop a pilot community-based patient navigator intervention designed to reduce barriers to care. This research will be incorporated into a career development plan that includes increasing the Principal Investigator's knowledge and skills in the areas of autism diagnosis and treatment, mental health disparities, interventional study design, and community-based research. The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and used as the basis for an NIH-funded proposal to conduct a multi-site test of the intervention designed in this project. Over 120,000 U.S. Latino children have been diagnosed with an ASD, a figure that likely underestimates the true prevalence. This project will help such children achieve earlier diagnosis and better long-term prognosis.          The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to improve rates of early diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders in Latino children. We will achieve this goal through surveying Latino parents to identify barriers to care and then developing a pilot patient navigator intervention designed to reduce the barriers that we identified. This research will be incorporated into a career development plan that includes increasing the Principal Investigator's knowledge and skills in the areas of autism diagnosis and treatment, mental health disparities, interventional study design, and community-based research.

"Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors in Puerto Rican Youth Growing Up     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use/abuse (SU/SUD) and other HIV/STI risk behaviors are major public health challenges not equally distributed across racial/ethnic groups. The fastest growing minority population in the US, Latino  youth, have elevated rates HIV/STI risk behaviors and SU/SUD, particularly among those abandoning  traditional Latino values and shifting towards American values (acculturation). This application, in response to  PA-09-236: HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations in the US (R01), aims to identify factors related  to the development of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection among Latino youth during a critical  transitional developmental period: emerging adulthood. Existing studies have revealed important disparities, however, they are limited in their ability to identify processes relevant for Latino youth, as they have not included sufficient numbers of Latino youth from fairly homogeneous subgroups (e.g.  Puerto Ricans, Mexican- Americans, etc.) and lack information about acculturation, a key determinant of risk among Latino youth. We propose to conduct the fourth wave on the Boricua Youth Study (BYS~ R01 MH56401) focused on HIV/STI risk, infection in emerging adulthood (BYS Wave 4, N=1,992, youth ages 16 - 24). The BYS has already generated 3 waves of data (years 2001 to 2004) on children of Puerto Rican background (ages 5 -13 at Wave 1), with study findings described in 19 peer-reviewed publications to date. Besides the comprehensive longitudinal assessment strategy, a unique feature of the BYS is its two-site design, as it included children living in the South Bronx (SBx), NYC and San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR). At BYS Wave 4, we propose to conduct intensive assessment of HIV/STI risk (including testing for HIV and STIs) and enhance the assessment of SU/SUD, in addition to continuing tracking of cultural experiences, and psychiatric disorders and other factors. The proposed study has as its specific aims, to examine: (I) Prevalence of HIV/STI risk behaviors and rates of HIV/STI infection in emerging adulthood and the influence of sexual orientation, teenage unintended pregnancy and early sexual debut. (II) How development of SU/SUD (nicotine, alcohol, illicit/prescription drugs) starting in childhood/earlyadolescence may influence HIV/STI risk in emerging adulthood in the context of a  Ecodevelopmental framework. (III) The role of acculturation (cultural practices, identification, values) in relation to SU/SUD and its relationship to HIV/STI risk behaviors/infection.   Once Wave 4 is completed, the BYS will represent an unparalleled source of prospective information  about onset of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection  as well as persistence and progression of SU  from childhood to emerging adulthood in a homogeneous Latino subgroup examined in two contexts (SBx and  PR).This information will fill a gap in knowledge, and the model resulting from our investigation will enable and  facilitate the integration of specific factrs of relevance for Latino youth (e.g., acculturation) as part of  interventions for this high-risk group.             A population-based longitudinal study is the best strategy to understand specific mechanisms involved in processes determining HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in relation to substance use and abuse among high-risk youth who are part of the fastest growing US minority group194 and whose risk experience have not been properly addressed to date (given for example, the superficial assessment as issues such as acculturation). By adding a 4th wave of data to the Boricua Youth Study (which started about 10 years ago), we can, in 5 years (rather than in 15, if a cohort like that had to established today a a very high cost), close a key gap in knowledge and generate information about risk and protective factors as well as mechanisms  operating in the determination HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in the lives of a high-risk Latino group  (Puerto Ricans), directly informing highly needed intervention advancement, contributing to revert important  health disparities.

"Mentoring in the Context of Improving Care for Latinos with Diabetes  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The exponential growth of the US born and immigrant Latino population over the last two decades in the United States, coupled with the national increase in obesity, has led to an enormous increase in the number of Latino patients with diabetes. Effective care of these patients is often complicated by language barriers, low health literacy, and low patient engagement which all contribute to well-documented disparities in diabetes outcomes. This proposal outlines a 5 year career development plan for the candidate to expand her mentoring work with early career researchers focused on clinical and health services research dedicated to improving diabetes outcomes among low-income Latino patients. In addition to mentoring plans, the proposal outlines three specific aims to a) Identify patient perceptions of barriers and facilitators to accessing language assistance services in diabetes care; b) Explore barriers and facilitators to the establishment of healthy infant feeding habits among low income Latina women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the context of an automated telephone self-management intervention; and c) Develop and formatively evaluate a social marketing campaign aimed at encouraging Latino parents with diabetes to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption in their children aged 3-11. Through the efficient leveraging of existing resources, collaborations, data, and affiliations with NIH-funded networks, the overarching goal of this application is to promote the effective mentorship of early career investigators at all levels of the research training pipeline in Latino diabetes clinical and translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The enormous growth of the Latino population with diabetes poses challenges for patients, physicians, and health care systems, particularly when language barriers exist. The proposed funding will support the expanded mentoring of early career investigators--from every level of the training pipeline--in clinical and health services research dedicated to improving outcomes for low-income Latinos with diabetes. It will also support a research project on determining Latino diabetes patients' role in overcoming language barriers in health care, and two innovative projects a             ",Mentoring in the Context of Improving Care for Latinos with Diabetes,8689828,K24DK102057,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Infant ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' sugar ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Knowledge ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' cohort ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' TIM1 ', ' P60 ', ' GEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Research Training ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Clinical Services ', ' health literacy ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' feeding ', ' Minority ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2014,183864,0.1704854312225786
"ENLACE: A Promotora-Led Physical Activity Intervention Trial for Latinas in Texas     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Latinos experience a disproportionate burden of hypokinetic-related chronic diseases, threatening the future health of the nation's fastest-growing population. Physical inactivity has been linked to increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. Latinos are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to fail to meet physical activity (PA) recommendations, and Latino women are less physically active than Latino men. The goal of the proposed ENLACE research project is to design, implement and evaluate a promotora-led PA intervention that takes a comprehensive, multi- level, community-based approach to promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among a particularly underserved segment of Latinas. The intervention approach, based on the social ecological model, focuses on individual attitudes and skills, socio-cultural factors and environmental influences to behavior change. The proposed group- randomized controlled trial builds on formative and pilot research (funded by a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute R21, HL087765) by a team of academic investigators and community partners with extensive experience working together to conduct behavioral interventions and outreach with Latino and disadvantaged populations. Eight community resource centers (CRCs) in four predominantly Latino counties in South Texas' Lower Rio Grande Valley will be randomly assigned to either the Enlace PA Intervention (4 CRCs) or an attention-control condition (4 CRCs). We will recruit 704 Latinas ages 18-64 who do not meet national PA guidelines from colonias (unincorporated, impoverished, underserved Latino settlements) in the CRC service areas. Participants from CRCs randomized to the Enlace PA Intervention (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions followed by 24 weeks of a maintenance intervention (monthly promotora-delivered newsletters and telephone counseling). The group sessions' behavioral goal is for Latinas to engage in 30 minutes per day of MVPA on 5 or more days per week. The attention- control group (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions on home safety/first aid and monthly generic health education materials and informational telephone calls during the maintenance intervention period. The primary outcome is minutes per week of MVPA (measured with accelerometers). Secondary outcomes are physical fitness and weight maintenance. We also will evaluate self-efficacy, social support, decisional balance, and collective efficacy as mediators of MVPA changes. Standardized measurement of primary and secondary outcomes will occur at baseline, immediate (16 weeks) and delayed post-intervention (40 weeks). We hypothesize that Latinas in the ENLACE PA Intervention will significantly increase their MVPA levels as a result of addressing their specific individual, socio-cultural and environmental barriers and enhancing their social support and collective efficacy, compared to attention-control Latinas.            Increasing Latinas' ability to gain the benefits of regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is a key strategy for addressing Latino health disparities. Enlace was developed in partnership with community members, to enhance Latina's behavioral skills, promote social support and collective efficacy, and enhance access to culturally appropriate, economical PA resources in their communities. Research results will provide scientific knowledge about effective community-based intervention methods with potential for replication in underserved areas across the nation and will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of community-wide participation in research to bolster efforts to eliminate health disparities.

"Innovative Physical Activity Interventions for Overweight Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the US and are disproportionately impacted by chronic conditions (e.g., overweight/obesity, diabetes) that can be mitigated by physical activity. While evidence-based programs are available to improve physical activity, dissemination is constrained by reliance on costly, limited resources. Short message service (SMS or text messaging) has strong potential as an intervention medium for Latinos, as they are dominant users of mobile phones and text messaging, including those with limited literacy and computer skills. We propose to develop a personalized, culturally-congruent and interactive SMS program to promote the adoption and maintenance of physical activity for overweight, underactive Latino adults and test it for comparable efficacy to an evidence-based telephone-based advising program that has been used successfully with Latinos. Grounded in Social Cognitive and Self-Determination Theories, both programs will include a core set of self-regulatory skill building, social support, and autonomous motivation enhancement, and will be tailored for cultural, linguistic and literacy appropriateness. Randomized at the individual level, 376 sedentary, overweight Latinos ages 45 years and older will be assigned to one of three arms: the SMS- delivered physical activity program, the Human-delivered physical activity program, or an attention-control arm of SMS-delivered basic healthful nutrition advice. They will receive their assigned program for 12 months, and then will be followed for a 6-month maintenance phase, with a final assessment at 18 months. Analyses will determine if the two physical activity programs result in equivalent efficacy in adoption and maintenance of clinically meaningful physical activity increases, and superiority over the attention-control arm at 12 and 18 months. The two physical activity interventions will also be compared for equivalency in prevention of weight gain and reduction in abdominal adiposity. We will explore the relative costs of the programs to determine which program increases physical activity for a lower cost. While health promotion programs delivered by professional staff may be more expensive than those delivered electronically, it is unclear if the automated version can produce more cost-efficient outcomes (i.e., comparable improvements in outcomes for significantly reduced cost). This study will determine if SMS is equivalent in efficacy to the traditional human-delivery channel in increasing physical activity and preventing weight gain, and if it results in a more cost-efficient program. If achieved, this research can significantly reduce health disparities associated with physical activity for Latinos by providing an efficacious tailored and culturally appropriate program poised for widespread dissemination and rapid uptake.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there has been a surge of electronic and mobile health promotion programs to increase regular physical activity (a key health behavior linked with the prevention and control of obesity and Type II Diabetes), few have been adapted to meet the needs and preferences of midlife and older Latinos. This research aims to investigate the effectiveness of an automated Simple Message Service (SMS, also known as text messaging) advisor system relative to a proven human advisor program to promote regular, sustained physical activity among inactive, overweight Latinos. The SMS Advisor program represents a potentially lower-cost and high yield alternative to person-delivered health promotion programs that could be more rapidly disseminated with greater and faster uptake.            ",Innovative Physical Activity Interventions for Overweight Latinos,8815984,R01DK102016,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Body Weight ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Literacy ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Electronics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Maintenance ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Proverb ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Determination ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Latino ', ' Schedule ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' Reliance ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' waist circumference ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' telehealth ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Media Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Text ', ' abdominal adiposity ', ' abdominal fat ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' health literacy ', ' weight gain prevention ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' computerized ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based program ', ' comparative ', ' computer generated ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,669184,0.05119950191441935
"A CBPR Initiative to Address Obesity Disparities for Latinos in the San Joaquin V     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary Nationwide, Latinos of all age groups disproportionately experience overweight and obesity morbidity and mortality. These disparities are exacerbated in communities with high rates of poverty and limited English proficiency. The eight-county region of the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California is such an area. SJV is represented by one of the highest concentrations of Latinos in the U.S., predominantly of Mexican descent. The region also has among the highest rates of undocumented, immigrant Latino populations which are largely under-represented in research and pose greater challenges in relationship with researchers. Established in 2005, the University of California, Merced (UC Merced) is the first-ever research university in the SJV and one of two Hispanic Serving Institutions in the 10-campus UC system. Since its inception UC Merced has had a strong, formal commitment to improve the well-being of SJV. Since 2006, UC Merced has grown an initiative for Community Engaged Scholarship that has contributed to multiple regional CBPR efforts with a focus on social justice and health equity. These efforts have not well reached the Latino communities in SJV nor have they addressed obesity disparities. The proposed collaboration between UC Merced, Central California Regional Obesity Prevention Program, and several regional community stakeholders will create a formal CBPR initiative to address obesity disparities among Latinos, with a focus on families and multigenerational households (common for Latinos in SJV). Traditional working partnerships, advisory boards, and conference and meeting methods will be blended with emerging CBPR approaches such as Open Space, World Cafes, Photovoice, and social media to establish a strong and sustainable network of action research that is culturally and linguistically appropriate Training and support will aim to improve the capacity of both community and academic partners to work synergistically to establish an action plan to use CBPR to address Latino obesity disparities. Advisory, planning, and action teams will be established with community-academic representatives and across community sectors (e.g.., faith, business, education) and generations. The project will produce sustainable community-academic relationships and infrastructure, and initial proposals for CBPR projects on Latino obesity/overweight disparities in the SJV.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Nationwide, Latinos of all age groups disproportionately experience overweight and obesity morbidity and mortality. The project will produce sustainable community-academic relationships and infrastructure, and initial proposals for CBPR projects on Latino obesity/overweight disparities in the SJV.            ",A CBPR Initiative to Address Obesity Disparities for Latinos in the San Joaquin V,8758413,R13HD080986,"['Action Research ', ' Age ', ' Americas ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Household and Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Household ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Ownership ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' Social Justice ', ' Solutions ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' Businesses ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' social ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' working group ', ' obesity prevention ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, MERCED",R13,2014,30000,0.14510424964765606
"Developing a Community Empowered Intervention to Promote Latino Family Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last two decades, Latino population growth has exceeded that of all other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. This growth has been particularly striking in Oregon, the site of this study, and in 21 similar states with emerging immigrant communities. Rapid population growth, when combined with unprepared health and social service systems, can significantly contribute to Latino health disparities. Parenting practices have long been implicated as a key influence on family and child health. The proposed study involves collaboration between the University of Oregon's Center for Equity Promotion (CEQP) and Farmworker Housing Development Corporation (FHDC) and is designed in three phases: (1) collaboration advancement and community needs assessment (n = 95); (2) intervention development; and (3) intervention feasibility and initial efficacy trial {n= 120 families; 210 parents, 120 youth). The intervention would be delivered with Spanish-speaking Latino parents who live in FHDC housing developments and would focus on those malleable behaviors (e.g., parenting practices, stress management, healthy nutrition, and physical activity) that can promote Latino family health and youth well-being. The study's specific aims are: (1) to create a sustainable structure for ongoing, community-empowered research by building on our existing collaborative community partnership; (2) to identify key family-based health behaviors that confer risk for and protection against negative physical and behavioral health outcomes (e.g., overweight and obesity, respiratory illness, substance use, depression, and youth problem behaviors) among FHDC families, through a collaboratively designed and implemented mixed methods needs assessment; (3) to develop, refine, and manual-ize an intervention that adapts promising practices from community and evidence-based interventions shown to impact behavioral and physical health outcomes for immigrant Latino families, and emphasizes family resilience, strong parenting practices, and family health-promoting behaviors; and (4) to examine the feasibility and initial efficacy of the intervention in terms of promoting healthy famiy behaviors that reduce risk for negative physical and behavioral health outcomes.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): This community-based participatory research study aims to identify priority areas and malleable factors that, if positively influenced through an interventio targeting family health, could have broad ripple effects for reducing disease, including chronic conditions, among Latinos.

"Life Course Socioeconomics, Acculturation, & Type-2 Diabetes Risk Among Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the US carry a disproportionate burden of type-2 diabetes. Research has implicated life course socioeconomic position as a major factor in the development of chronic diseases, such as type-2 diabetes; yet most evidence is limited to non-Hispanic White populations. We hypothesize that the large disparities in type-2 diabetes among Latinos reflects the joint effect of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic factors, cultural characteristics, behaviors, biology, and other risk factors accumulating over the life course. The experience of Latinos in the US represents an especially fruitful context in which to investigate the influence of life course socioeconomic and cultural resources in relation to type-2 diabetes. In addition to being the fastest growing minority population with high rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes, the experience of Latinos is one that includes first generation immigrants with limited education and job skills, and later generations who are born and raised in the US and show varying levels of acculturation and assimilation, behavioral change, and socioeconomic advancement. With these unique considerations in mind, the present study seeks to: (1) examine the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; (2) assess whether acculturation modifies the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; and 3) examine whether metabolic and inflammatory markers related to behavioral, physiological, and psychosocial risk factors mediate the relationships between life course socioeconomic position, acculturation, and type-2 diabetes among Latinos. The proposed research activity will constitute the first systematic attempt to assess the unique and synergistic contributions of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type 2 diabetes among Latinos. By assessing life course exposures across two generations of Latinos living in the US, this project provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify targets for early intervention for reducing the heavy burden of type-2 diabetes among Latinos. More broadly, the proposed research may uncover crucial life course socioeconomic and cultural patterning of risk factors or health promoting characteristics that may also benefit other race/ethnic minorities disproportionately living in poverty and suffering from type-2 diabetes.          The proposed study will assess the impact of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type-2 diabetes and examine potential biological mediators, including inflammation, among two generations of US Latinos. The findings from this study will have important public health implications, including identification of critical risk facors and biological mechanisms mediating the effects of life course sociocultural contexts on type-2 diabetes across generations of US Latinos.

"Reducing Cancer Disparaties Among Latinos in Texas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Texas regional Community Networks Program, Latinos Contra El Cancer, combines innovative research, extensive community outreach, and a multi-faceted training program, all conducted within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) context, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in Latinos, and to build a cadre of competitive health disparities researchers trained in CBPR in three regions of Texas (Houston, El Paso, the Lower Rio Grande Valley). This will be accomplished through the work of three distinct yet complementary cores (Outreach, Research, and Training) to integrate knowledge generation, community health education, and community and researcher capacity building within and across the three sites, building on existing research infrastructures, longstanding relationships, and novel communication systems. The overarching goals of each Core are described below.  The goal of the proposed Outreach Program is to increase the use of evidence-based biomedical and behavioral procedures and interventions to reduce the cancer burden among Latinos in Texas. We will build on existing community partnerships, infrastructure, and programs to develop an Outreach Program that will accomplish this goal through capacity building with community partners and direct health promotion in Latino communities.  The goal of the Research Core - Intervention Study is to develop and evaluate an innovative intervention approach for reducing cancer risk related to the three leading behavioral risk factors for cancer: smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity. The project will focus on participants in a longitudinal study of cancer risk factors among Mexican Americans in Houston (Mexican American Cohort Study).  The goal of the Research Core - Pilot Study is to utilize quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the socio-demographic, acculturation, and psychosocial factors that influence Mexican Americans willingness to provide biologic specimens for biobanking.  The goal of the mentored Training Program is to prepare a cadre of new and early stage investigators to conduct cancer disparities research in Latino communities, with a particular emphasis on building skills and capacity to conduct community-based participatory research. Latinos Contra El Cancer combines innovative research, extensive community outreach, and a multi-faceted training program, all conducted within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) context, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in Latinos, and to build a cadre of competitive health disparities researchers trained in CBPR in three regions of Texas (Houston, El Paso, the Lower Rio Grande Valley).",Reducing Cancer Disparaties Among Latinos in Texas,8925523,U54CA153505,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Goals ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Latino ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Community Networks ', ' Staging ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' cancer risk ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Behavioral ', ' willingness ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' evidence base ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U54,2014,65835,0.04296226760927538
"Community-Based Prevention of Youth Violence in Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent violence is an important public health problem in the US, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Latinos are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group of children in the US, and are disproportionately affected by youth violence. There is, however, little information on the risk and protective factors that influence Latino youth violence. The overall objective of this proposed NICHD Career Development Award research is to identify risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration. This will be accomplished through three specific aims, which are to: 1) Identify beliefs, attitudes, and norms that influence violence perpetration among Latino adolescents; 2) Identify risk and protective factors in the family, peer, and community contexts that predict violence perpetration in a cohort of Latino youth; and 3) Validate and examine the relative contributions of individual, family, peer, and community factors to violence among Latino adolescents. In Aim 1, focus groups of violent and non-violent Latino adolescents will be conducted to examine risk and protective factors for violence, violence prevention strategies, and components of potentially effective violence prevention interventions. For Aim 2, a secondary data analysis of the National Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) will be conducted using multi-level modeling techniques to determine which contextual factors in adolescence are associated with violence perpetration approximately two years later. The findings from Aims 1 and 2 will be used in Aim 3 to design a survey that concurrently examines individual and contextual factors associated with youth violence, and to test the survey in a large sample of Latino adolescents. Findings from these three studies will provide the foundation for a future Latino youth violence prevention intervention that is culturally tailored, focuses on the major risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence, and is informed by Latino youth. This innovative approach uses multiple methods (qualitative, multi-level longitudinal quantitative, and a survey) to address a significant public health need for improving the knowledge base required to develop successful community-based interventions for Latino youth violence prevention. The proposed award is consistent with the component of the NICHD mission to ensure that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability. The exceptional resources and institutional support at UT Southwestern, outstanding multi-disciplinary mentorship team, and the proposed career development activities, will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and nationally recognized expert on community-based interventions effective in reducing and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence. There is an epidemic of youth violence in the US, with 36% of adolescents involved in fighting and 18% in weapon-carrying, and Latinos are disproportionately affected by violence; because youth violence can result in serious injury and homicide, there is an urgent need to identify strategies that can lead to successful violence prevention interventions for Latino youth. The proposed research identifies risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration using focus groups with Latino youth, multi-level modeling of a longitudinal dataset, and a newly-designed survey administered to Latino youth. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence, as the proposed research studies could lead to the development of an effective youth violence prevention intervention for Latinos.",Community-Based Prevention of Youth Violence in Latinos,8914181,K23HD068401,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Belief ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Financial cost ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' weapons ', ' tool ', ' fighting ', ' Techniques ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Community based prevention ', ' peer ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' cultural values ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' National Survey of Adolescents ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NICHD,LUNDQUIST INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION AT HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2014,82776,0.0253308250650047

"A Promotora Program to Prevent Primary Tooth Decay in Low-income Latino Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KDH Research & Communication (KDHRC) proposes to develop and evaluate Dientes Fuertes, Vida Sana (DFVS), a culturally-competent program to prevent primary tooth decay in low-income Latino children ages zero to six. To effectively reach low-income Latino children, DFVS will train promotores de salud (PS) at Latino-serving community-based organizations (CBOs) to conduct outreach to Latino parents and guardians to build their knowledge and skills in 1) oral health literacy, including proper brushing, flossing, ad feeding practices to prevent primary tooth decay; and 2) oral healthcare system navigation, which includes when, where, and how to seek dental care and treatment and methods to overcome barriers to dental care.  DFVS addresses a pressing public health need. Public health officials have called tooth decay a silent epidemic and the greatest unmet childhood health need. On an individual level, childhood tooth decay predicts lasting and substantive physical, psychosocial, and economic consequences. On a societal level, childhood tooth decay costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars yearly, due mostly to emergency room care for preventable tooth pain. DFVS matches this pressing public health need with the PS intervention model, which has demonstrated effectiveness, culturally-competency, and cost-efficiency. DFVS is unique in the field.  At the completion of this project, we will have the complete DFVS program, which will consist of four bilingual English/Spanish components: 1) a Training Guide (TG) for a CBO-based facilitator to conduct eight, two-hour sessions to prepare PS to conduct outreach to Latino guardians; 2) a multi-part training telenovela, or streaming video that dramatically illustrates Latino oral health challenges for PS learning and discussion; 3) an Implementation Guide (IG) to build CBOs' capacity to effectively use DFVS; and 4) a distribution website to host DFVS. What is more, we will have substantive data on DFVS's effectiveness as a culturally-competent program to prevent primary tooth decay in low-income Latino children ages zero to six. These data will stem from two sources. First, the feasibility evaluation will explore the extent to which DFVS is a useful, culturally- appropriate program that CBOs will adopt. It will also test how exposure to the DFVS prototype changes PS' knowledge, improve attitudes, and increase self-efficacy to conduct outreach to Latino guardians. Second, the outcome evaluation will test DFVS in a two group, multi-stage, controlled trial of DFVS's effectiveness when implemented by a group of CBOs. Taken together, DFVS and its evaluation results aim to reduce oral health disparities among low-income Latino children ages zero to six by creating an evidence-based, culturally- competent program to prevent primary tooth decay. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DFVS meets a pressing public health need. Public health officials have called tooth decay a silent epidemic and the greatest unmet childhood health need. Low-income Latino children are at particular risk of experiencing tooth decay and its lasting and substantive physical, psychosocial, and economic consequences. DFVS will address the costly public health problem of tooth decay in low-income Latino children using CBO- based PS as a culturally-competent method to build Latino guardians' knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions in oral health literacy and oral healthcare system navigation. DFVS will be the only program of its kind and it thereby innovatively meets calls for interventions to prevent tooth decay in this vulnerable population.",A Promotora Program to Prevent Primary Tooth Decay in Low-income Latino Children,8786297,R44DE023713,"['Age ', ' Attitude ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Market Research ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' United States ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' Letters ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Communication Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDCR,"KDH RESEARCH AND COMMUNICATION, INC.",R44,2014,433657,-0.001594444682514801
"Addressing acquiescence: Reducing survey error to promote Latino health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous advances have improved our ability to collect valid and reliable data on health behaviors and outcomes. However, health behaviors are often influenced by psychosocial variables - such as attitudes and beliefs - that are unobservable and, thus, more difficult to measure. Attitudes and beliefs are typically measured using Likert-scaled items, in which respondents rate their agreement with statements along a continuum. Since the 1920s, researchers have observed that some respondents tend to systematically agree to Likert-scaled questionnaire items, regardless of question content. This pattern of responding to survey questions is known as acquiescent response style (ARS). ARS jeopardizes efforts to reduce health disparities. ARS can weaken health experts' understanding of what factors influence health behaviors, their ability to create effective interventions, and th accuracy with which they evaluate programs to reduce health disparities. Research indicates that ARS use may be influenced by culture, and, in the U.S., may be of particular concern when surveying Latino populations. Research by the investigators and others suggests that 22-24 percent of Latino survey respondents acquiesce on health surveys, as compared to 13 percent of non-Latino Whites. These culturally patterned differences in ARS may introduce error in health survey data, which, in turn, may artificially create or enhance distinctions both within Latino populations and between Latinos and non-Latino Whites, thereby erroneously informing health disparities research. The Latino population is demographically and culturally diverse, and almost nothing is known about what factors may drive ARS use among Latinos from different ethnic or cultural groups. Further, despite a growing need to obtain valid health data from Latinos, who comprise 16 percent of the U.S. population and are expected to increase to 29 percent by 2050, it is unclear how to address ARS. The proposed study will: (1) identify predictors of ARS; and (2) screen for the most promising methods of reducing ARS during data collection and adjusting for ARS after data collection is complete. This research focuses on Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans, as these groups comprise the three largest Latino sub-groups. Data from this study will be derived from two surveys. The first survey will gather data from 2900 Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, and non-Latino Whites in order to identify factors associated with ARS. The second survey will compare different methods of addressing ARS among 1161 Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Cuban American health survey respondents. Findings from this research will provide researchers with empirically driven guidance on when to anticipate and how to reduce ARS-associated measurement error when surveying Latino respondents. Such knowledge will improve health data validity through increased ARS awareness and standardization of methods to address ARS, thereby contributing to more accurate understanding of the psychosocial determinants of Latino health, more effective health promotion programs targeting Latinos, and better long-term Latino health outcomes.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will enhance our ability to address an important source of health survey measurement error, which, when unaddressed, may weaken our understanding of moderators and mediators of health behaviors, our ability to create effective interventions, and the accuracy of our efforts to evaluate programs to redress Latino health disparities. Findings from this research will empower health researchers to make empirically guided decisions about the collection and treatment of survey data as they promote the health of the U.S.'s growing, culturally diverse Latino population.            ",Addressing acquiescence: Reducing survey error to promote Latino health,8687623,R01CA172283,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cuban American ', ' Data Collection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Surveys ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Play ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' psychosocial ', ' empowered ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' trait ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' stem ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2014,445216,0.19886768627056653
"Promoting post-treatment self-management among Latinos with cancer     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spanish-speaking Latinos with cancer experience disparities related to the need for information, communication with clinicians, quality of care, an increased risk of the sequelae of cancer and its treatment. Patient activation interventions, such as those that promote survivorship care planning (SCP) are critical to increase their self-efficacy and resources for addressing these disparities. The overall goal of this study is to enable Spanish-speaking cancer survivors to be active participants in their care once the acute cancer treatment phase has ended. The aims of this project are to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of providing survivorship care planning and education through an interactive mobile phone application (mSCP) for Spanish-speaking men and women with breast or colorectal cancer as they approach the end of active treatment in public hospital settings. Mobile phones are an excellent delivery mode among Latinos due to their widespread use of web-enabled phones to access the internet. We will develop a low- literacy Spanish-language mobile phone application (mSCP) that helps cancer survivors understand their diagnosis and treatment, implement and track physical activity and stress management practices, recognize symptoms of recurrence or late effects of treatment, and communicate these symptoms to their health care providers. Through a pilot 3-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 50 Spanish-speaking Latinos with non-metastatic breast or colorectal cancer, we will compare the effects of the 3-month interactive mSCP intervention versus usual care on self-reported outcomes at 3 months including cancer coping self-efficacy, cancer-specific distress, fatigue, and walking. We also will assess knowledge of needed follow-up visits and surveillance exams. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study procedures, we will collect process evaluation data on: costs to produce a treatment summary; protocol adherence; adverse events; use of the mSCP; and key informants' (10 intervention group participants and 4 oncology providers) perceptions of the intervention, study procedures, and outcomes (e.g., perceived benefits, ease of use, burden). The mSCP will utilize daily diary and cumulative bar graphs for self-monitoring, immediate positive feedback on diary entries, daily stress management and exercise messages, and low-literacy modules with step-by-step guides to using the cancer coping skills. Results of this 2-year study will prepare us to conduct a large-scale RCT. Having SCP information in a user-friendly mobile phone application is a promising approach to promote high quality survivorship care. These types of interventions may be acceptable and economical ways of meeting the informational and self-care needs of Latino cancer survivors and help reduce disparities in health and cancer care. If proven effective in a subsequent study, this user-friendly, secure mobile phone tool could help Spanish-speaking cancer survivors, and potentially other vulnerable populations, meet evidence- based recommendations for health care and self-management after acute cancer treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project promotes public health goals because it addresses cancer health disparities experienced by vulnerable low-income Spanish-speaking men and women, who lack access to culturally and linguistically appropriate follow-up care once they complete acute cancer treatment. Because it uses a mode of delivery (mobile phones) that is popular among ethnically diverse low-SES populations and has great dissemination potential, this study is an important first step that could lead to widespread access to cancer survivorship support via a free application that can be disseminated to supplement clinical care.            ",Promoting post-treatment self-management among Latinos with cancer,8770500,R21CA182536,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Solutions ', ' survivorship ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' empowerment ', ' Graph ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' education planning ', ' cancer care ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' diabetes risk ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Population Group ', ' Low income ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' informant ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' treatment effect ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' web-enabled ', ' user-friendly ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2014,206190,0.03282234260622317
"Using Brief Interventions to Reduce Unhealthy Drinking Among Latino Day Laborers     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research fulfills the NIAAA's mission to address health disparities by reducing unhealthy drinking among a high-risk and underserved population of Latino immigrant men. Latinos are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the country and immigration to the United States (US) has increased dramatically over the last ten years. Latino men are more likely to engage in unhealthy drinking than men in other racial/ethnic groups and their alcohol use increases with time spent in the United States. Despite these disparities, Latino immigrant men are unlikely to receive evidenced-based screening and brief intervention for unhealthy drinking due to their limited access to health care. We have culturally adapted a brief intervention for this population in order to broaden its reach and increase its efficacy. This stud will test the feasibility and efficacy of offering a culturally adapted intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking among Latino day laborers, who are particularly vulnerable to unhealthy drinking given their economic and social context. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the feasibility of offering screening and brief intervention to Latino day laborers delivered by community health workers (Promotores) at a day labor worker center; and 2) test the initial efficacy of the intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking using a randomized control group study design. Feasibility will be assessed through qualitative and quantitative assessments of recruitment, retention, reach, intervention fidelity, and participant satisfaction. We will assess changes in unhealthy drinking from baseline to eight weeks in both the intervention and the control group. We hypothesize that levels of unhealthy drinking will be lower in men in the intervention than the control group. The study uses several innovative approaches to address a significant health disparity in a high-risk and underserved population, including offering the intervention at a day labor worker center, using community health workers to deliver the brief intervention, and adapting the brief intervention to be more culturally relevat, and using tablets for data collection and providing personalized feedback. Findings will help determine the best methods for optimizing recruitment, data collection and intervention fidelity in a hard to reach population. If effective, screening and brief interventions could be implemented by community health workers in day labor worker centers nationwide, as well as a variety of other community settings. Given that Latinos are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the country, reducing unhealthy drinking in this population could have a significant public health impact by lowering rates of morbidity due to alcohol abuse and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer and unintentional injury. Furthermore, this novel intervention approach may also be generalizable to other health issues prevalent in the Latino immigrant community.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test the feasibility and efficacy of screening and brief intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking among Latino immigrant men in a community setting. Reducing unhealthy drinking in the growing population of Latino immigrant men could have a significant public health impact by lowering rates of morbidity due to alcohol abuse and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer and unintentional injury.                ",Using Brief Interventions to Reduce Unhealthy Drinking Among Latino Day Laborers,8762133,R34AA022696,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Language ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social isolation ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' drinking ', ' social ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Community Health ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' screening and brief intervention ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R34,2014,180687,0.0674065814236708
"A Longitudinal Study of Noncognitive Skills among Latino Immigrants Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study will examine the development of non-cognitive skills during elementary school among children of Latin American immigrants. Non-cognitive skills, which encompass a variety of emotional, behavioral, and personality traits, are related to key indicators of child and adult well-being. Thus, understanding group differences in non-cognitive skills may shed light on educational and health disparities. Children of Latin American immigrants now comprise nearly 14% of American children under 18. The health and educational prospects of these children are thus of substantial public policy concern. Previous research has shown that Latino children of immigrants differ from native children at school entry in terms of both cognitive skills and non-cognitive skills, but the role of non-cognitive skills in their educational outcomes has yet to be systematically examined. Such skills may be an important determinant of incorporation trajectories of Latino and other contemporary immigrant groups. This research will fill several significant gaps in the current knowledge. First, although the growth rate of non-cognitive skills varies during childhood, the most previous research examining inter-group differences in non-cognitive skills has focused on comparisons at a single time point. The proposed research will take a longitudinal approach to measuring non-cognitive skill development from grades K-8. Second, little is known about the predictors of non-cognitive skills among Latino immigrants' children and how they compare to those of natives' children. While we know that Latino immigrant families differ from the native population in certain critical factors, such as the use of early childcare and parental education-related practices, such differences have yet to be studied in relation to the development of non-cognitive skills. Third, the contributions of non-cognitive skills to differences in academic achievement between Latino immigrants' and natives' children have yet to be studied. This project will analyze data from the ECLS-K to address 3 specific aims: (1) To describe differences in non-cognitive skills between Latino children of immigrants and three native comparison groups, at different points in time during the elementary school years; (2) To identify correlates of non-cognitive skill development for children of Latino immigrants and compare their predictive power with native comparison groups; and (3) To examine the contribution of non-cognitive skills to gaps in educational achievement between Latino immigrant students and native comparison groups.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health and educational prospects of Latino immigrants' children are of substantial public policy concern due to the large size and low average socioeconomic status of this group. Non-cognitive skills are related to health outcomes because they directly impact health behaviors and because they affect educational attainment, a key predictor of health disparities. Understanding the unique trajectories and determinants of non-cognitive skills among Latino immigrants' children will help policymakers promote greater health and educational achievement for this group.              ",A Longitudinal Study of Noncognitive Skills among Latino Immigrants Children,8751343,R03HD080789,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Family ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Language ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Motivation ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' American ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Emotional ', ' kindergarten ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2014,74750,0.11288703184891384
"A Multi-Ethnic Faith and Public Health Partnership to Reduce Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congregational involvement has been promoted as a way to help reduce health disparities among African Americans and Latinos in the U.S; however, the multifaceted health needs found in many urban areas, as well as the complex set of factors leading to health inequalities, mean that broad and sustainable, multi- ethnic, multi-denominational faith and health partnerships are needed. The goal of this project is to build a network of African-American and Latino congregational leaders, public health partners, and researchers to jointly reduce disparities in South Los Angeles (LA). The specific aims of the project are: 1) Develop a sustainable faith and public health partnership to build capacity to address health disparities experienced by Latinos and African Americans; 2) Jointly develop an intervention to leverage congregational and public health resources toward the goal of reducing disparities in outcomes for Latinos and African Americans for an identified health condition; 3) Pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among African American and Latino congregations. The specific health condition and intervention strategy used will be defined by a Steering Committee composed of key denominational and inter-denominational associations and public health entities serving South Los Angeles, together with researchers at the RAND Corporation and its primary community partner, Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches (LAM); based on initial input, the focus will likely be on one of three health issues: cancer, obesity, or HIV. The study will be collaborative throughout all stages, and we will develop strategies to strengthen the partnership's capacity to address health disparities beyond the focus on this initial condition. The partnership is innovative in bringing together religious, public health, and research organizations to address health disparities jointly and in using novel techniques for soliciting community input. Further, it emphasizes mutual capacity building and sustainability so that researchers are better able to design and evaluate interventions; congregations gain knowledge about community health issues and skills in conducting health programs; and public health practitioners contribute to and learn from the development of best practices in promoting community health.         RELEVANCE: This will be the first multi-ethnic, multi-denominational faith and public health research partnership that aims to reduce health disparities in an on-going and interactive fashion and using novel techniques to obtain community input. This effort will lead to an in-depth understanding of diverse faith community perspectives on health disparities and the potential for addressing them through congregation-based programming.

"Culturally-Sensitive School-Home Behavioral Program for Latino Children with ADHD     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research and training plan aims to provide the applicant with experience implementing and analyzing Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Disorder (ADHD) clinical trials, utilizing qualitative methodolog to determine meaningful themes and develop culturally sensitive guidelines for diverse families in need of mental health services, expanding multicultural competence and sensitivity, and advancing independence as a clinical researcher. ADHD is one of the most common childhood mental health disorders across cultures, with the continuously growing Latino youth population displaying as great or greater risk for ADHD. Latino children experience unfortunate mental health disparities leaving them less likely to seek and receive appropriate ADHD services, which can prevent long-lasting and widespread impairment in the areas of academic, social, and familial functioning related to ADHD. In order to reduce mental health disparities for Latino children, the field is in need of culturally-sensitive clinical psychologists trained to conduct intervention research and develop guidelines for culturally appropriate ADHD services. The training proposed in the current plan will set the stage for the applicant's career as an independent clinical researcher focused on developing, investigating, and disseminating culturally-appropriate assessment and treatment practices for children with ADHD. These goals not only serve as priorities for the applicant, but also appeal to two of the four current National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) objectives (i.e., developing new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illnesses and strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research).  The sponsor, Dr. Linda Pfiffner, is an established clinical researcher who has served as the principal investigator of multiple ADHD clinical trials, including the current Department of Education (DOE) funded efficacy trial of Collaborative Life Skills (CLS) Program- the intervention proposed in the current research/training plan. The co-sponsor, Dr. Patricia Arean, has extensive experience with multicultural clinical psychology, including clinical/research work with Latino Americans. The mentorship of the sponsors, as well as the training resources available at UCSF, provide the ideal opportunity for the applicant to complete the proposed research and training plan and achieve the following specific aims:  Aim 1) Compare Latino and non-Latino families recruited for and participating in ADHD services at all levels of the help-seeking behavior model.  Aim 2) Conduct mixed-method investigation with Latino families participating in CLS and develop culturally- sensitive guidelines for ADHD behavioral treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although Latino children (who are expected to comprise one quarter of the youth population by 2050) are at as great or greater risk for displaying ADHD, Latino children are under-diagnosed and underserved compared to non-Latino children. Investigation of differential response to existing evidence-based treatments for ADHD and subsequent development of culturally-sensitive guidelines may increase problem recognition, encourage decision to seek appropriate help, and improve completion of, satisfaction with, and outcomes from service utilization to ultimately reduce the mental health disparities between Latino and non-Latino children with ADHD.

"Increasing the Pipeline: Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this program is to increase the proportion of Latinos in cancer control research, particularly in the Southwestern U.S., by establishing a Latino Training Program for Cancer Control Research (LTPCCR) that will motivate Latino master's-level students and health professionals to complete doctoral programs and careers as cancer control researchers. The LTPCCR is modeled after an evidence-based training model entitled, Minority Training Program in Cancer Control Research (MTPCCR) that targeted a spectrum of ethnic groups in California. Specifically, the LTPCCR will recruit an annual cohort of 20 Latino master's-level students or master's-trained health professionals. An innovation of the LTPCCR is that it targets a single ethnic minority - Latinos/Hispanics who will come from the Southwestern U.S. and Oklahoma. It will provide four interventions along the pipeline from masters-level to doctoral-level training, including: a) a Summer Institute for all participants, b) 9 annual paid summer internships in cancer disparities research (Y2-5), c) 3 annual Doctoral Application Support Awards and d) a Doctoral Student Retreat. Lastly, it will demonstrate an enrollment rate in doctoral programs that exceeds Latino enrollment achieved by the previous MTPCCR. We anticipate a minimum annual Latino enrollment of at least 15% (a 33% increase over that achieved by the MTPCCR). Additional we expect at least 50% of doctoral students reporting cancer control as their research focus and the majority of doctoral students indicating that the Texas program had a strong positive influence on these academic goals. Other benchmarks for success include a significant increase in self-efficacy and in participants' intention to apply to a doctoral program after attending the Summer Institute; and a minimum of 65% of participants rating each session as excellent.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite private and governmental support for programs that encourage Latinos to move through the pipeline from high school to college to research in basic sciences and medicine, there has been little investment in the social and behavioral sciences that send cancer control researchers out into communities to conduct epidemiologic, communication, and behavioral research.

"Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance Abstract  The purpose of the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA) is to ameliorate the lack of highly qualified first-generation-educated Latino graduates prepared to engage in graduate degrees in health disparities research in both biomedical and health science-related disciplines. Latinos have been and continue to be gravely underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social science disciplines. In 2009 Latinos made up fewer than 5% of all medical scientists, despite being 15.8% of the US population, the largest minority group. Although Latinos represent a growing proportion of college admissions, they continue to lag behind in enrollment and degree completion (Becerra 2010). Entry-level science courses (e.g. chemistry, biology) tend to eliminate Latinos students from advancement in science degrees. In response to this critical educational deficit, and with support from the NIMHD Science Education Initiative, the NCLR/CSULB Center for Latino Community Health, Evaluation, and Leadership Training, will develop the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA).  HOLA will provide health disparities research training and tutoring in science to Latino students in their sophomore and junior years, thus widening the pool of minority applicants for advanced degrees. Moreover, HOLA will be open to students across the natural and health sciences reaching out to pre-health majors who otherwise would not be eligible to participate in existing research opportunities.  HOLA will provide 140 Latino undergraduate students and 30 minority graduate students with educational, mentoring, and career development opportunities designed to facilitate careers in health disparities research through the delivery of: 1) targeted undergraduate tutoring in diverse science courses for Latino pre-health and health science students; 2) workshops in health disparities research methods; 3) health disparities seminars highlighting population-specific issues; and, 4) an annual health disparities conference.

"Health Inequalities: Social Isolation Among Rural Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate for this K01 Award, a Latina nurse researcher, is requesting support for career development training and research, to become an independent investigator in mental health promotion among rural minorities. The overall career goal is to advance science at the nexus of culture, mental health, and rurality. The long-term goals of the training are to (1) build a mental health promotion research agenda among rural minority populations to enable rural communities to implement and sustain healthy socio-emotional environments and (2) serve as a role model and mentor for minority students and junior faculty. Specific short- term goals are to (1) develop and apply expertise in advanced research methods that are critical to an understanding of minority rural populations which can lead to the development of related health policy, (2) understand the role of social isolation in th cultural adaptation of rural Latino families in order to develop culturally relevant interventions, (3) develop expertise in the design and implementation of a repertoire of individual, family, and community public health interventions that reduce social isolation among rural Latinos, and (4) conduct independent investigator-initiated community-based research on mental health promotion among rural Latinos. Social isolation among rural Latino immigrants increases the risk of poor mental health outcomes and is significantly related to depression and anxiety among adults and suicidal ideation in children and adolescents. Longer time spent in the U.S. is associated with higher risk of mental health problems among Latinos, yet early promotion of mental health has not been targeted among this population. The specific aims of the proposed research are to (1) explore the effect of Latino immigrants' perceptions of their rural social environment and social isolation on their mental well-being through ethnographic interviews, (2) evaluate protective factors and modifiable risks to mental well-being associated with social isolation and the social environment among Latino immigrants living in a rural area, and (3) design a culturally appropriate family centered intervention to strengthen significant intrafamilia and intercommunity networks and promote positive mental well-being. This exploratory study is guided by community engagement research principles and employs mixed-methods to unravel the complexities of social isolation and develop an intervention to promote mental well-being among rural Latino immigrants. In-depth ethnographic interviews (N=60) and a quantitative community assessment survey (N=100) will be conducted with Latino women and men living in the rural ""new destinations"" of north Florida. Findings and engagement with an established community advisory board will culminate in the development of a family centered intervention to promote mental well-being. A mentoring team of distinguished national and international scientists has been assembled to achieve the training and research goals.

"Reducing HIV Disparities among Latinos: Disseminating An Effective Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a 3-year study (R24) to facilitate dissemination, uptake, and sustainability of the HoMBReS: Por UN Cambio intervention, a lay health advisor (LHA) intervention found to be efficacious in reducing the HIV risk among immigrant Latino men in the Southeast. Informed by the lived experiences of immigrant Latino men, perspectives of organizational representatives, and social cognitive and empowerment theories, this intervention was developed and tested by a long-term community-university partnership that has used and will continue to use community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles throughout all phases of the research process. In the proposed study, 3 community-based organizations (CBOs) that represent typical community-level providers of HIV and STD prevention interventions (i.e., an AIDS service organization, a Latino-serving organization, and a county public health department) will work with our existing CBPR partnership to develop a comprehensive toolkit to guide implementation; implement and evaluate implementation; and disseminate results and materials through multiple channels. Each CBO will hire 1 part-time project coordinator to recruit, train, and support 8 lay health advisors (known as ""Navigates""). These 24 Navigates will promote sexual health among members of their soccer team-based social networks for 12 months. Baseline and follow-up data will be collected from social network members to evaluate impact. Blending both quantitative and qualitative methods, we will explore facilitators and barriers to intervention implementation, fidelity, and potential sustainability by these diverse CBOs. Pre and post-implementation, we will conduct individual in-depth interviews with CBO representatives. Post-implementation, we also will conduct focus groups with Navigates at each CBO. We will use scale-up and spread, a framework informed by diffusion and social normative theories, to guide this study. We also will evaluate the CBPR process, using in-depth interviews with partners, direct observation of partnership meetings and study implementation, and partnership document review.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will provide insights to the increasing number of CBOs in the South seeking to reduce HIV/STD-related health disparities among the growing population of immigrant Latinos; and aligns with the Affordable Care Act's emphasis on recruiting and training community health workers to connect marginalized populations with preventive health services.                ",Reducing HIV Disparities among Latinos: Disseminating An Effective Intervention,8698812,R24MD002774,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diffusion ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Life Experience ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Newsletter ', ' North Carolina ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' health care professional practice ', ' Professional Practice ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Soccer ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' ']",NIMHD,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R24,2014,458802,0.07113008118947985
"Association of Acculturation with Type 2 Diabetes Risk Among US Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its long term sequelae are increasing in the US, particularly among Latinos. Latinos are at increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and develop T2D at younger ages and at a lower body weight index compared to non-Hispanic whites. For these reasons, Latinos have been identified as a NIDDK priority population with a NIDDK research agenda that includes both biologic, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors that affect T2D prevalence and complications. Acculturation is an important socio-cultural factor that may explain the disproportionate health burden of T2D among Latinos. Acculturation is defined as the process whereby an immigrant culture adopts the beliefs and practices of a host culture. There are limited studies of T2D risk factors and acculturation and how this relationship affects intermediary T2D processes and outcomes such as incident T2D and subclinical cardiovascular disease. The association between acculturation and T2D is inconsistent among Latinos in the published literature. This grant will study the association of acculturation with T2D risk and risk factors using data from multiple well- established epidemiologic NIH cohort studies using validated multidimensional acculturation scales that capture the complex domains of cultural values, beliefs, and behaviors of the acculturation process. The 5 cohorts are: San Antonio Heart Study, Sacramento Latino Study of Aging, Boston Area Community Health Survey, Dallas Heart Study and the Framingham Heart Study Omni Cohort. The simultaneous comparison of findings will maximize the potential for exploring whether the reported heterogeneity of prior study findings is due to differences in underlying Latino cohort characteristics, geographic differences in the process of acculturation in the US and/or differences in the measure of acculturation. Dr. Lopez's long-term goal is to become an independent patient-oriented researcher in diabetes care. Aided by advanced coursework in biostatistics and social epidemiology during the K23 award period, Dr. Lopez will acquire additional research skills and experience under the mentorship of nationally and internationally known researchers in a supportive academic environment. 1        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acculturation is an important socio-cultural factor that may explain the disproportionate health burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among Latinos. Understanding how acculturation impacts T2D risk factors and outcomes among Latinos will inform how best to tailor lifestyle and behavioral interventions and reduce health disparities. 2",Association of Acculturation with Type 2 Diabetes Risk Among US Latinos,8710210,K23DK098280,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Body Weight ', ' Boston ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Literature ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Physiology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' Immigrant ', ' apM1 (adipose-specific) protein ', ' apM-1 protein ', ' adipocyte, C1q and collagen domain containing protein ', ' adipocyte complement-related protein 30-kDa ', ' ACRP30 protein ', ' adiponectin ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Visceral ', ' subcutaneous ', ' waist circumference ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' diabetes risk ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' adipokines ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' obesity risk ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' public health relevance ', ' fasting glucose ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2014,185977,0.1251277926056329
"NIMHD RESEARCH CENTER ON LATINO IMMIGRANT/REFUGEE HEALTH DISPARITIES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The changing demographics of the U.S. population ~ in which recent immigrants are playing a key role in population growth ~ have and will continue to exert a major influence on the course of health disparities. Therefore, the very timely overall mission of the proposed GWU NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center is to build on an existing academic-community collaboration with the Latino immigrant population in the Washington, DC metropolitan area in order to better understand factors contributing to racial/ethnic minority health disparities specific to this critical population, to increase both community and academic capacity to address these factors, and to test a multi-level community intervention addressing the health disparity issue of substance abuse and co-occurring conditions. This collaboration will: 1) Contribute to the transdisciplinary advancement of the field with respect to eliminating health disparities as well as the health of the Latino community; 2) Develop, implement and evaluate an innovative, community-driven, multi-component community intervention (called ADELANTE) that addresses a vulnerability cluster of substance abuse and co-occurring conditions in youth and families ; 3) Provide an ongoing mechanism for training and educating faculty, students and community members in a range of issues related to addressing racial/ethnic health disparities generally and in Latino immigrant/refugee populations; and provide opportunities for partner community members to gain specific research skills that will increase capacity and research participation; and 4) Support the overall mission of the Center by conducting specific, collaborative activities aimed at: increasing skills and knowledge related to preventing substance abuse and related health conditions, testing innovative social media and branding strategies to increase the likelihood of behavior change, and improving health literacy and capacity using a tested community training approach. 5) Disseminate the results of the research to the participating communities and to the field, via the Center website and multiple channels.             The proposed Center is highly relevant because of its demographic focus, its foundation In an existing university-community partnership, and the clear need to develop collaborative intervention and research approaches to address health disparities in this significant population group.",NIMHD RESEARCH CENTER ON LATINO IMMIGRANT/REFUGEE HEALTH DISPARITIES,8608951,P20MD006898,"['Communities ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Diet quality and cardiometabolic disparities among Latino ethnic subgroups     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal for this application for a NHLBI-K01 Faculty Diversity Mentored Career Development Award is to provide the candidate, Josiemer Mattei, PhD, MPH, with indispensable training to become an independent researcher in nutrition and cardio-metabolic disparities in Latinos, through epidemiological and intervention projects. These have been constructed along a comprehensive training program facilitated by a team of expert mentors in nutritional epidemiology, cardiovascular health, and community interventions.  Responding to the staggering prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic disease in Latinos living in the United States (US), and to the limited studies on the dietary habits and cultural beliefs that may contribute to those disparities, the research aims are to (1) to identify diet quality indices within Latino ethnic subgroups in the US and to evaluate associations of such indices with traditional and emerging CVD risk factors within ethnicity, (2) to contrast diet quality of Puerto Ricans in the mainland US versus the island, and assess how it is associated with long-term cardio-metabolic factors; and (3) to assess deep-cultural factors (core beliefs and influences) related to diet and disease and determine efficacy of a pilot intervention based on such components for Latino subgroups on improving diet quality. Analyses for the first two aims will be conducted using data from the national Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study, and the San Juan Obese Adult Longitudinal Study in Puerto Rico. Latino multiethnic adults will be recruited for the mixed-methods formative and pilot studies to be conducted at the South End Community Health Center in Boston, MA. To match the scope of the proposed scientific work, this proposal includes five career-development and training areas: (1) research expertise through the proposed aims, (2) coursework in advanced epidemiological methods, and behavioral and community intervention methods, (3) multiple career-building activities to acquire essential tools for leadership and professional growth, as well as dissemination and translation of findings, (4) continued mentoring and monitoring by an outstanding team of senior mentors and an advisory committee; and (5) a detailed plan to expand grant support and collaborations with various national institutions. This K01 project will compellingly impact public health by bridging the gap in knowledge of traditional diet quality of specific Latino groups and how these may shape racial and ethnic disparities in CVD risk factors. The work will provide preliminary data to support longitudinal studies on diet and disease, and full-scale community trials on improving diet quality to reduce disease burden among Latinos. The project builds upon exceptional resources and mentoring at the candidate's institution (Harvard School of Public Health) and partnering organizations, to train her in key new areas, bolster applications for competitive funding, disseminate findings among researchers and the wider community, augment faculty diversity, and attain research independence.  (End of Abstract)                   NARRATIVE Latinos, the largest minority group in the United States, have an extremely high prevalence of cardio-metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Nutritional strategies could help lower that burden, yet few data exist on the quality of the traditional diets of specific Latino subgroups in the US and their effect on risk of cardio-metabolic diseases, or on which cultural aspects of diet and disease may enhance community- based dietary interventions for Latinos. This proposal aims to bridge that gap by utilizing existing US Latino cohorts with robust data on diet and CVD risk factors to examine ethnic-specific association of diet quality with cardio-metabolic risk factors, and then apply those observational results into a pilot intervention culturally tailored for Latino ethnic subgroups to improve their diet quality.

"Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino population has experienced a dramatic increase over the past decade, making it the largest minority group in the United States (US). Along with this surge in numbers Latinos also face greater challenges in accessing health care compared to the general population. These health disparities, which are particularly salient among Latina women, make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors that affect the disproportionate numbers of people suffering from HIV/AIDS and substance abuse in this population. Our long term goal is therefore to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventual elimination of HIV/AIDS and substance abuse health disparities among Latinos. The proposed Center will expand on the activities of our current P-20 NIMHD C-SALUD located at Florida International University (FlU). C-SALUD will focus its research, training, and community collaboration activities with Latinos in Miami-Dade County, a county that not only houses a high concentration of Latinos but also has the dubious distinction of having one of the highest rates of HIV, cocaine related deaths, and emergency room admissions in the U.S. The proposed continuing C-SALUD will build on ongoing collaborations with community based organizations which have a longstanding history of providing health and social services to Latinos at risk for HIV and substance abuse as well as other underserved Latino populations in South Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: Administrative, Research, Research Education /Training, and Community Partnership/Engagement. The target population will be Latinos, particularly Latina women residing in Miami-Dade County with a focus on Latina farm workers ages 18 and older and recent Latina immigrants who have lived in the U.S. less than one year, ages 18-23.

"Johns Hopkins Healthy Eyes Translational Research Center    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this cooperative agreement is to assess and evaluate system level and individual level factors that impact access to eye care; and to identify barriers and enablers to the delivery of eye care conforming to best practices that prevent vision loss and promote eye health. The Johns Hopkins Translational Research Center (TRC) will analyze multiple existing databases to develop a knowledge base for a public health interventions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities and improving the eye health of underserved populations in the United States. Specifically, we will focus on focus on cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Finally, we propose a collaborative study that uses this knowledge for implementation at the city level. The first set of analyses will focus on personal and perceived system barriers associated with the uptake of eyecare services in three previously studied populations: African Americans and Caucasians from the Salisbury Eye Evaluation (SEE) study and Latinos living in Arizona (studied as part of Proyecto Ver) and Latinos living in Baltimore (evaluated in the ProVision study funded by the NIH). The barriers and enablers of obtaining cataract surgical services will be assessed in all three racial/ethnic groups, whereas factors related to screening for diabetic retinopathy will be addressed using the two Latino populations, supplemented with analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Finally, the rates of glaucoma screening provided using the Medicare screening benefit as well as the rates and patterns of treatment of glaucoma will be assessed using data from Medicare. Additionally, NHANES has both visual field and optic nerve imaging and these data will be used to determine associations with having been diagnosed with glaucoma when it is present in order to identify groups at high risk for underdiagnosis. The proposed TRC network combined project will consist of establishing diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening surveillance systems in collaboration with city governments to be able to monitor patterns of care, especially among at risk underserved populations. An intervention will be tested to increase DR screening rates based on the findings of the analyses described above. Finally, a pre/post assessment will be made to see if the intervention might be expanded nationally.              Project Narrative This study is highly relevant to the public health. Findings from this research will inform policy planners and insurance administrators of key barriers and enablers associated with the major blinding eye conditions faced by minority populations in the United States. Furthermore, the high risk but high impact network project may lead to novel public health approaches at the city level to improving eyecare for persons with diabetes.",Johns Hopkins Healthy Eyes Translational Research Center,8690572,U58DP002653,[''],NCCDPHP,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,U58,2014,268491,0.048719263041837164
"ENLACE: A Promotora-Led Physical Activity Intervention Trial for Latinas in Texas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Latinos experience a disproportionate burden of hypokinetic-related chronic diseases, threatening the future health of the nation's fastest-growing population. Physical inactivity has been linked to increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. Latinos are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to fail to meet physical activity (PA) recommendations, and Latino women are less physically active than Latino men. The goal of the proposed ENLACE research project is to design, implement and evaluate a promotora-led PA intervention that takes a comprehensive, multi- level, community-based approach to promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among a particularly underserved segment of Latinas. The intervention approach, based on the social ecological model, focuses on individual attitudes and skills, socio-cultural factors and environmental influences to behavior change. The proposed group- randomized controlled trial builds on formative and pilot research (funded by a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute R21, HL087765) by a team of academic investigators and community partners with extensive experience working together to conduct behavioral interventions and outreach with Latino and disadvantaged populations. Eight community resource centers (CRCs) in four predominantly Latino counties in South Texas' Lower Rio Grande Valley will be randomly assigned to either the Enlace PA Intervention (4 CRCs) or an attention-control condition (4 CRCs). We will recruit 704 Latinas ages 18-64 who do not meet national PA guidelines from colonias (unincorporated, impoverished, underserved Latino settlements) in the CRC service areas. Participants from CRCs randomized to the Enlace PA Intervention (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions followed by 24 weeks of a maintenance intervention (monthly promotora-delivered newsletters and telephone counseling). The group sessions' behavioral goal is for Latinas to engage in 30 minutes per day of MVPA on 5 or more days per week. The attention- control group (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions on home safety/first aid and monthly generic health education materials and informational telephone calls during the maintenance intervention period. The primary outcome is minutes per week of MVPA (measured with accelerometers). Secondary outcomes are physical fitness and weight maintenance. We also will evaluate self-efficacy, social support, decisional balance, and collective efficacy as mediators of MVPA changes. Standardized measurement of primary and secondary outcomes will occur at baseline, immediate (16 weeks) and delayed post-intervention (40 weeks). We hypothesize that Latinas in the ENLACE PA Intervention will significantly increase their MVPA levels as a result of addressing their specific individual, socio-cultural and environmental barriers and enhancing their social support and collective efficacy, compared to attention-control Latinas. Increasing Latinas' ability to gain the benefits of regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is a key strategy for addressing Latino health disparities. Enlace was developed in partnership with community members, to enhance Latina's behavioral skills, promote social support and collective efficacy, and enhance access to culturally appropriate, economical PA resources in their communities. Research results will provide scientific knowledge about effective community-based intervention methods with potential for replication in underserved areas across the nation and will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of community-wide participation in research to bolster efforts to eliminate health disparities.",ENLACE: A Promotora-Led Physical Activity Intervention Trial for Latinas in Texas,8909331,R01HL111718,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' First Aid ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Latino vs. Non-Latino Disparities in Advance Care Planning & End-of-Life Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we aim to explain and reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in advance care planning (ACP) and end-of-life (EOL) care. Latino advanced cancer patients are less likely than non-Latino advanced cancer patients to engage in ACP - a practice to help terminally ill patients and their families achieve EOL goals of care. Consistent with this disparity in ACP, Latino advanced cancer patients receive aggressive, burdensome EOL care more often than do their non-Latino counterparts. They are also less likely than others to use hospice services and to receive EOL care in line with their preferences. Consequently, the EOL care that Latino advanced cancer patients receive appears to be suboptimal, inferior to the care that non-Latino patients receive, infrequently guided by ACP, and often counter to their values. In this project, we will address these disparities in ACP & EOL care through two closely related sub-projects. In the first of these sub-projects, we aim to identify beliefs that contribute to Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care (Specific Aim 1). We will conduct an observational study of beliefs, ACP and EOL outcomes in 400 advanced cancer patients (N=200 Latino; N=200 non-Latino) and their informal caregivers (e.g., spouses; N=400) whom we will recruit from clinics in New York City, Dallas, and Chicago. In this observational study, we will examine the extent to which religious, familial and cultural medical beliefs mediate or moderate Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care, and identify significantly influential beliefs as potential targets of an intervention to reduce those disparitis. In the second sub-project, using results from this observational study as a guide, we aim to develop and pilot a belief-contextualization intervention to reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care (Specific Aim 2). Specific Aim 2 will proceed in three phases. In Phase I, we will briefly review results of Specific Aim 1 and ask Latino stakeholders to provide input on possible belief-contextualization interventions to determine those likely to be most effective in, and acceptable to, Latino communities. In Phase II, we will design a belief-contextualization intervention to reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care that incorporates elements identified in Phase I and then vet that intervention with a separate group of Latino stakeholders. In Phase III, we will evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of the belief-contextualization intervention developed in Phase II. Overall, results of this study will identify influential beliefs that explain Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care, and offer the promise of an effective approach to the reduction of Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP, and, ultimately, EOL care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Latino and non-Latino (White and Black) Americans. Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, and are less likely than their non-Latino counterparts to engage in advance care planning (ACP). They are also more likely to receive aggressive, burdensome end-of-life (EOL) care at odds with their cultural beliefs. Consequently, there is a pressing need to address Latino/non-Latino disparities in cancer ACP and EOL care. Identification and targeting of influential beliefs about medical care is expected to reduce disparities in ACP and EOL care. It will, thus, reduce disparities in the quality of the medical decision-making and care Latino cancer patients receive near death.                ",Latino vs. Non-Latino Disparities in Advance Care Planning & End-of-Life Care,8773681,R01MD007652,"['advanced directive ', ' Advance Directives ', ' Affect ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Influentials ', ' living will ', ' Living Wills ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Resuscitation ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Terminally Ill ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Intensive Care ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Trust ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Health Care Power of Attorney ', ' Healthcare Power of Attorney ', ' Inferior ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' cancer pain ', ' authority ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Secrecy ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' palliative ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIMHD,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2014,468101,0.13972987082743124
"Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Underserved Communities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Aging Latino Communities BACKGROUND: Aging Latino adults suffer disproportionately from a number of chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity) improved by increased physical activities (PA) such as walking. Due to language, education, computer, and health literacy barriers, older Latino adults often cannot readily access typical health promotion programs offered in-person or online in U.S. communities. Lay health advisors (""promoters"" in Spanish) offer a nationally recognized, culturally tailored and cost-efficient health behavior change model for Latino communities. However, as with all ""human"" delivered health programs, they impose constraints on participant schedules, and, even with careful intervention fidelity procedures in place, some variability in program delivery across advisors is inevitable. Computer-based culturally tailored physical activity advisor programs can potentially reduce human- to-human scheduling and fidelity constraints and extend program reach. In a recently completed 4- month experiment, a computer-based bilingual Virtual Advisor with touch-screen interactivity (no keyboard or mouse needed) was housed in a community center and programmed to tailor PA advice to the needs and preferences of low-income, aging Latino adults. The Virtual Advisor program successfully increased regular walking levels in participants compared to a health education control. OBJECTIVE: The primary study aim is to conduct a comparative effectiveness trial evaluating the 12- month impacts of the community-based Virtual Advisor PA program relative to a proven Lay Advisor program in a broader population of aging Latino adults. The secondary aim is to determine the comparative cost effectiveness of the Virtual vs. Lay Advisor programs. DESIGN: The 12-month randomized trial will enroll inactive Latino adults ages 55 years and older living near 16 neighborhood community centers (n=265/arm; 530 total). The primary outcome is minutes of walking per week, and additional outcomes of interest include BMI, sedentary behavior, functional performance, and health- related quality of life. Additional areas of investigation are to evaluate theoretically based and empirically supported moderators and mediators of intervention success and determine the potential generalizability of the interventions. IMPACT: The study seeks to demonstrate that a computer-based Virtual Advisor tailored to the needs of aging Latino adults can provide an effective and potentially cost-efficien alternative to Lay Advisors in community settings frequented by this population. The potential extended reach of such programs for use in a range of community settings (e.g., clinics, pharmacies, libraries) provides substantial promise for positively impacting the current health disparities gap.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there has been an explosion of computerized health promotion programs to increase regular physical activity-a key health behavior linked with the prevention and control of our nation's major killers--few have been adapted to the needs and preferences of low-income Latino adults. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based 'virtual lay advisor' relative to a proven human lay advisor program-both delivered at local community centers--in promoting regular walking among inactive midlife and older Latino adults. The Virtual Advisor program represents a potentially low-cost alternative to person-delivered health promotion programs that could be translated for use in a range of community settings (e.g., clinics, pharmacies, libraries).",Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Underserved Communities,8719161,R01HL116448,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Be element ', ' Beryllium ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Cues ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electronics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Walking ', ' Latino ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Trust ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' health literacy ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' monetary value ', ' economic value ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' natural language ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,749856,0.0774292805521725
"End-of-life treatment preferences of Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End of Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Principal Investigator: Isabel Torres, Dr.P.H. The overall goal of the NCI K01 career development plan is to provide the candidate with a program of mentored research activity and study in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and outcomes research to launch an independent research career with specialization in the integration of these research areas. The five-year plan is carefully designed to 1) obtain further research experience in the areas of palliative cancer care, health disparities and health services research; 2) advance skills related to the design and analyses of prospective palliative care studies through training in advanced statistical methods; 3) improve skills needed to develop and test new instruments and performance measures to improve the accuracy of assessing quality outcomes for both English and Spanish speaking Latinos with cancer; 4) acquire further grant writing skills and experiences, resulting in the submission of an R01 grant before the end of the support period. Properly identifying the end-of-life preferences of cancer patients is a national healthcare priority and understanding the clinical, cultural, psychosocial and system-level factors that influence these decisions is paramount for clinicians and policymakers trying to respect patient preferences and improve their quality of care. The aim of the study is to determine if declining health status influences the end-of-life treatment preferences in Latino Medicare beneficiaries with cancer and how these preferences are modified by factors such as acculturation, health literacy, medical mistrust, provider ethnicity or the use of interpreters, or patient navigators. Participants will be 100 older Latino Medicare beneficiaries with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer, stage III or greater, and 100 contemporaries without cancer. Persons without cancer will be surveyed only once cross-sectionally and those with cancer will be interviewed at baseline and then monthly until twelve months or death to capture the preferences of both those who are undergoing rapid decline and those who are stable. Understanding the relationship between declining functional status and the treatment preferences of older Latinos with cancer has important clinical and policy implications, as findings could influence the use of written documents for advance care planning and inform the content and frequency of discussions that may be needed to capture changes in preferences triggered by changes in health status. We expect the proposed area of study and research that integrates palliative cancer care and health disparities research and applies prospective analytic methods to investigate a critical and understudied area to make a significant contribution to cancer care research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: End-of-Life Treatment Preferences of Latino Medicare Beneficiaries with Cancer Latinos are the fastest growing segment of the older population and new Latino cancer cases are predicted to double within the next twenty years. A person with cancer's choices to forgo life-extending treatment may change over time and as their health declines, yet identifying their choices related to one of life's most difficult periods is not always easy. This study will determine if the combination of declining health, cultural factors and meeting the cultural and language needs of Latino cancer patients, influence their end-of-life treatment choices.

"Randomized Trial of Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of PTSD among Latinos     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to provide effective treatment to Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD is critical given the high prevalence of PTSD among Latinos in comparison to other racial/ethnic groups and the projections for dramatic demographic growth of the Latino population. The committee convened by the Institute of Medicine to assess the evidence on the efficacy of treatments for PTSD reported strong evidence supporting the efficacy of exposure therapies for the treatment of PTSD. The committee further noted that although psychotherapies may present special challenges in different ethnic/cultural groups, ""the evidence is mostly silent on the acceptability, efficacy, or generalizability of treatment in ethnic and cultural minorities."" Eliminating health disparities for diverse cultural groups is a public health priority.One of the nation's health objectives presented in Healthy People 2010, called for eliminating disparities in mental health and mental health care for all racial/ethnic groups. Nevertheless, an evaluation conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2010 revealed that Latinos received less mental health care than other racial/ethnic groups. The report acknowledges that limited English proficiency could be a contributing factor for the gap in mental health care for Latinos. The significant impairment and the high societal costs associated with PTSD underscore the urgency of the need to make the benefits of clinical advances in the treatment of PTSD available to Latinos with limited English proficiency. The proposed study directly addresses this mental health care disparity by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy with Spanish- speaking Latinos. In preliminary work, we translated and culturally adapted the PE therapy manual, maintaining fidelity to the original treatment, and conducted a pilot study that evidenced the feasibility and acceptability of PE for Spanish-speaking Latinos. As our next step, we propose to conduct a RCT with Spanish-speaking Latinos to determine whether PE is superior to applied relaxation in improving primary (PTSD symptoms) and secondary (functioning, health-related quality of life, and depression) outcomes. We will recruit 100 Latinos with PTSD, 18-65 years old, in primary care clinics. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, week 20, and week 28. This study has the potential to contribute to improvements in the overall well- being and quality of life of Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD and, by extension, likely their families as well. Misconceptions about exposure therapy can contribute to limit its adoption in clinical practices serving Latinos. If positive results are evidenced for unacculturated Latinos in Puerto Rico, characterized by dominant Latino orientation, this study would establish an evidence base for expanded research that has the potential to shift current clinical practice in mental health settings serving Latino clients by facilitating adoption of a linguistically and culturally relevan PE manual-based treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is of considerable public health significance as it will provide foundational information on the clinical use of a linguistically an culturally relevant prolonged exposure therapy for the treatment of Spanish-speaking Latinos with posttraumatic stress disorder. This study has the potential to contribute to improvements in the well-being and quality of life of Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD and to reduce misperceptions of exposure therapy that can contribute to limit its adoption in clinical practices serving Latinos.",Randomized Trial of Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of PTSD among Latinos,8711558,SC1MH090599,"['Accidents ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' assault ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Client ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Rape ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Societies ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Terrorism ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Group Affiliation ', ' High Prevalence ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Minority ', ' attack (violent) ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' public health priorities ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,SC1,2014,371520,0.1705531561562944
"Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diabetes incurs the most expensive annual chronic disease-related health care costs and certain ethnic groups, such as Latinos, are disproportionately affected by the burden of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Patients with T2DM also have comorbid chronic conditions that create complexities for proper management, and have implications for future research on integrating primary and behavioral care, particularly in dis- advantaged groups. Cost-effective, sustainable, and patient-centered adaptations of evidence-based approaches to chronic disease management are needed to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, low- resource communities. Integrated Health Care is the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians working together with patients and using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. This care may address mental health conditions, health behaviors, life stressors and crises, and clinical outcomes. Care integration is a cornerstone of effective integrated health care that leads to improved clinical and quality of life outcomes and reduces health-care costs and hospitalizations, especially in vulnerable populations. The goal of this project is to improve integrated care services at a federally-qualified Community Health Center (CHC). Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D), is a randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of an integrated behavioral health and primary cae chronic care disease management intervention for low income T2DM Latino patients with 2 or more chronic conditions accessing care within San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC). The study aims are to: 1) improve glycemic control, 2) improve cardiovascular risk profiles, 3) decrease psychological distress, and 4) evaluate the patient and provider acceptability and sustainability of the program. LUNA-D will recruit 414 non-insulin using adult T2DM patients with 2 or more chronic diseases. Half will be randomized to the Special Intervention (SI) and half to Usual Care (UC). The SI is a 3-month intensive intervention including fully integrated clinical visits with a mid-level provider (MLP) co-located with a behavioral health counselor (BHC) and peer-led evidence-based group health education sessions and proactive care coordination. Following the intense intervention period, the SI will receive booster sessions and fully integrated MLP/BHC clinical visits across 9 additional months. Usual Care is represented by passive appointments with the primary care physician and passive referrals to behavioral health and traditional health education. HbA1C measurements will be taken at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months to detect changes in glycemic control. Clinical lab measures, medication adherence, weight, health behaviors and psychosocial measures will also be obtained across the study. Demonstration of clinical improvement will support adoption by the SYHC.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D) study, will conduct research that aims to reduce chronic disease disparities for disadvantaged Latino populations along the California-Mexico border region of the United States. LUNA-D proposes to test the ability of a fully integrated behavioral health and primary care multiple chronic disease management intervention in a federally-qualified community health care setting to improve multiple clinical and behavioral outcomes.              ",Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes,8674429,R01NR014866,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', '

"Community-Based Prevention of Youth Violence in Latinos    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent violence is an important public health problem in the US, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Latinos are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group of children in the US, and are disproportionately affected by youth violence. There is, however, little information on the risk and protective factors that influence Latino youth violence. The overall objective of this proposed NICHD Career Development Award research is to identify risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration. This will be accomplished through three specific aims, which are to: 1) Identify beliefs, attitudes, and norms that influence violence perpetration among Latino adolescents; 2) Identify risk and protective factors in the family, peer, and community contexts that predict violence perpetration in a cohort of Latino youth; and 3) Validate and examine the relative contributions of individual, family, peer, and community factors to violence among Latino adolescents. In Aim 1, focus groups of violent and non-violent Latino adolescents will be conducted to examine risk and protective factors for violence, violence prevention strategies, and components of potentially effective violence prevention interventions. For Aim 2, a secondary data analysis of the National Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) will be conducted using multi-level modeling techniques to determine which contextual factors in adolescence are associated with violence perpetration approximately two years later. The findings from Aims 1 and 2 will be used in Aim 3 to design a survey that concurrently examines individual and contextual factors associated with youth violence, and to test the survey in a large sample of Latino adolescents. Findings from these three studies will provide the foundation for a future Latino youth violence prevention intervention that is culturally tailored, focuses on the major risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence, and is informed by Latino youth. This innovative approach uses multiple methods (qualitative, multi-level longitudinal quantitative, and a survey) to address a significant public health need for improving the knowledge base required to develop successful community-based interventions for Latino youth violence prevention. The proposed award is consistent with the component of the NICHD mission to ensure that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability. The exceptional resources and institutional support at UT Southwestern, outstanding multi-disciplinary mentorship team, and the proposed career development activities, will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and nationally recognized expert on community-based interventions effective in reducing and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence.         There is an epidemic of youth violence in the US, with 36% of adolescents involved in fighting and 18% in weapon-carrying, and Latinos are disproportionately affected by violence; because youth violence can result in serious injury and homicide, there is an urgent need to identify strategies that can lead to successful violence prevention interventions for Latino youth. The proposed research identifies risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration using focus groups with Latino youth, multi-level modeling of a longitudinal dataset, and a newly-designed survey administered to Latino youth. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence, as the proposed research studies could lead to the development of an effective youth violence prevention intervention for Latinos.

"Diet quality and cardiometabolic disparities among Latino ethnic subgroups DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal for this application for a NHLBI-K01 Faculty Diversity Mentored Career Development Award is to provide the candidate, Josiemer Mattei, PhD, MPH, with indispensable training to become an independent researcher in nutrition and cardio-metabolic disparities in Latinos, through epidemiological and intervention projects. These have been constructed along a comprehensive training program facilitated by a team of expert mentors in nutritional epidemiology, cardiovascular health, and community interventions.  Responding to the staggering prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic disease in Latinos living in the United States (US), and to the limited studies on the dietary habits and cultural beliefs that may contribute to those disparities, the research aims are to (1) to identify diet quality indices within Latino ethnic subgroups in the US and to evaluate associations of such indices with traditional and emerging CVD risk factors within ethnicity, (2) to contrast diet quality of Puerto Ricans in the mainland US versus the island, and assess how it is associated with long-term cardio-metabolic factors; and (3) to assess deep-cultural factors (core beliefs and influences) related to diet and disease and determine efficacy of a pilot intervention based on such components for Latino subgroups on improving diet quality. Analyses for the first two aims will be conducted using data from the national Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study, and the San Juan Obese Adult Longitudinal Study in Puerto Rico. Latino multiethnic adults will be recruited for the mixed-methods formative and pilot studies to be conducted at the South End Community Health Center in Boston, MA. To match the scope of the proposed scientific work, this proposal includes five career-development and training areas: (1) research expertise through the proposed aims, (2) coursework in advanced epidemiological methods, and behavioral and community intervention methods, (3) multiple career-building activities to acquire essential tools for leadership and professional growth, as well as dissemination and translation of findings, (4) continued mentoring and monitoring by an outstanding team of senior mentors and an advisory committee; and (5) a detailed plan to expand grant support and collaborations with various national institutions. This K01 project will compellingly impact public health by bridging the gap in knowledge of traditional diet quality of specific Latino groups and how these may shape racial and ethnic disparities in CVD risk factors. The work will provide preliminary data to support longitudinal studies on diet and disease, and full-scale community trials on improving diet quality to reduce disease burden among Latinos. The project builds upon exceptional resources and mentoring at the candidate's institution (Harvard School of Public Health) and partnering organizations, to train her in key new areas, bolster applications for competitive funding, disseminate findings among researchers and the wider community, augment faculty diversity, and attain research independence.  (End of Abstract) NARRATIVE Latinos, the largest minority group in the United States, have an extremely high prevalence of cardio-metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Nutritional strategies could help lower that burden, yet few data exist on the quality of the traditional diets of specific Latino subgroups in the US and their effect on risk of cardio-metabolic diseases, or on which cultural aspects of diet and disease may enhance community- based dietary interventions for Latinos. This proposal aims to bridge that gap by utilizing existing US Latino cohorts with robust data on diet and CVD risk factors to examine ethnic-specific association of diet quality with cardio-metabolic risk factors, and then apply those observational results into a pilot intervention culturally tailored for Latino ethnic subgroups to improve their diet quality.",Diet quality and cardiometabolic

"ENLACE: A Promotora-Led Physical Activity Intervention Trial for Latinas in Texas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Latinos experience a disproportionate burden of hypokinetic-related chronic diseases, threatening the future health of the nation's fastest-growing population. Physical inactivity has been linked to increased risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. Latinos are more likely than non-Hispanic whites to fail to meet physical activity (PA) recommendations, and Latino women are less physically active than Latino men. The goal of the proposed ENLACE research project is to design, implement and evaluate a promotora-led PA intervention that takes a comprehensive, multi- level, community-based approach to promoting moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) among a particularly underserved segment of Latinas. The intervention approach, based on the social ecological model, focuses on individual attitudes and skills, socio-cultural factors and environmental influences to behavior change. The proposed group- randomized controlled trial builds on formative and pilot research (funded by a National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute R21, HL087765) by a team of academic investigators and community partners with extensive experience working together to conduct behavioral interventions and outreach with Latino and disadvantaged populations. Eight community resource centers (CRCs) in four predominantly Latino counties in South Texas' Lower Rio Grande Valley will be randomly assigned to either the Enlace PA Intervention (4 CRCs) or an attention-control condition (4 CRCs). We will recruit 704 Latinas ages 18-64 who do not meet national PA guidelines from colonias (unincorporated, impoverished, underserved Latino settlements) in the CRC service areas. Participants from CRCs randomized to the Enlace PA Intervention (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions followed by 24 weeks of a maintenance intervention (monthly promotora-delivered newsletters and telephone counseling). The group sessions' behavioral goal is for Latinas to engage in 30 minutes per day of MVPA on 5 or more days per week. The attention- control group (N = 352; 88 women per CRC) will receive 16 weekly promotora-led group sessions on home safety/first aid and monthly generic health education materials and informational telephone calls during the maintenance intervention period. The primary outcome is minutes per week of MVPA (measured with accelerometers). Secondary outcomes are physical fitness and weight maintenance. We also will evaluate self-efficacy, social support, decisional balance, and collective efficacy as mediators of MVPA changes. Standardized measurement of primary and secondary outcomes will occur at baseline, immediate (16 weeks) and delayed post-intervention (40 weeks). We hypothesize that Latinas in the ENLACE PA Intervention will significantly increase their MVPA levels as a result of addressing their specific individual, socio-cultural and environmental barriers and enhancing their social support and collective efficacy, compared to attention-control Latinas. Increasing Latinas' ability to gain the benefits of regular moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is a key strategy for addressing Latino health disparities. Enlace was developed in partnership with community members, to enhance Latina's behavioral skills, promote social support and collective efficacy, and enhance access to culturally appropriate, economical PA resources in their communities. Research results will provide scientific knowledge about effective community-based intervention methods with potential for replication in underserved areas across the nation and will contribute further evidence regarding the critical role of community-wide participation in research to bolster efforts to eliminate health disparities.",ENLACE: A Promotora-Led Physical Activity Intervention Trial for Latinas in Texas,8850261,R01HL111718,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Counseling ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' First Aid ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Literature ', ' Maintenance ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Partners for Strong, Healthy Families (PSHF) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos are a population at high risk for sexually transmitted diseases and use of substances. Latino youth are 2.8 times more likely to contract chlamydia, 2.2 times more likely to contract gonorrhea, 2.1 times more likely to contract syphilis (CDC, 2010) and have a higher rate of HPV infection, when compared to Whites. Latino 8th and 10th graders are also more likely than their White or Black peers to report lifetime past-year or past-month use of marijuana, cocaine, crack, and hallucinogens (Johnston, O'Malley, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2010). To date, efforts have been insufficient to reduce this disparity. But few studies have addressed multiple risks occurring concomitantly or independently by  engaging Latino families, youth and the community together in all aspects of intervention development. This community-based participatory research (CBPR) between the University of Southern California (USC) and Bienestar Health Services (BHS) aims to correct this inequity by including vulnerable Latino youth (16-21 years of age), families and the community to identity local needs, select, implement and test a pilot intervention in Los Angeles. We seek to  empower Latino families, youth, and community gate keepers in the discovery of culturally grounded intervention/s that optimally address complex-multiple risk processes resulting in serious inequities among Latino youth. Our aims are: 1) to establish a coalition -Partners for Strong Healthy Families (PSHF)- led by a Community Advisory Board (CAB) (community gatekeepers, parents, youths, Latino organizations) to engage in CBPR; collect data among 898 participants using qualitative and quantitative methods (needs assessment (n=400), an environmental scan in the selected community, 8 focus groups (n=96), key informant interviews (n=20), group model-building (GMB) via 6 small group meetings (n=120)) to identify community priorities and preferences; pilot test the resulting culturally tailored- language specific intervention (n=130 pr and 110 post test) that will provide detailed strategies to boost protective factors and reduce ris for engaging in early sex and substance use, strengthening Latino families; and evaluate the PSHF partnership and CAB on adherence to CBPR principles (n=22). An experienced CBPR team is committed to engaging Latino families, youth and community from conceptualization through dissemination in the discovery of new effective treatments and prevention strategies to address these complex multiple risk behaviors and reduce disparities. RELEVANCE (See instructions): In adolescent health, sexual risk and substance use are among the most difficult problems for families to address with their children. This CBPR study is directly relevant to discovering community based-culturally tailored intervention/s that reveal optimal ways to engage families, youth and communities; leads to the emergence of new effective strategies for treatment and prevention against multifactorial risk behaviors (sex & drugs and empowers Latinos to set their own cultural pathways to reduce these complex inequities.","Partners for Strong, Healthy Families (PSHF)",8842477,R24MD007978,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' California ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' bedsonia ', ' Miyagawanella ', ' Chlamydia ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Gonococcal Infection ', ' Gonorrhea ', ' Group Meetings ', ' psychotomimetic drug ', ' psychedelic drug ', ' Psychotomimetic Agents ', ' Psychedelics ', ' Psychedelic Agents ', ' Hallucinogenic Substances ', ' Hallucinogenic Drugs ', ' Hallucinogenic Agents ', ' Hallucinogens ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Heart ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Venereal Infections ', ' Venereal Disorders ', ' Venereal Diseases ', ' Sexually Transmitted Infection ', ' Sexually Transmitted Disorder ', ' Sexually Transmitted Diseases ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' great pox ', ' Syphilis ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Crack Cocaine ', ' free base cocaine ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Evaluation ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Collaborations ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Letters ', ' Review Literature ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Human papillomavirus infection ', ' HPV infection ', ' Human papilloma virus infection ', ' Complex ', ' Scanning ', ' Test Result ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' prevention service ', ' peer ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' gatekeeper ', ' Gatekeeping ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Instruction ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' 21 year old ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' treatment strategy ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R24,2015,588063,0.10994957420749252
"Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Underserved Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Aging Latino Communities BACKGROUND: Aging Latino adults suffer disproportionately from a number of chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity) improved by increased physical activities (PA) such as walking. Due to language, education, computer, and health literacy barriers, older Latino adults often cannot readily access typical health promotion programs offered in-person or online in U.S. communities. Lay health advisors (""promoters"" in Spanish) offer a nationally recognized, culturally tailored and cost-efficient health behavior change model for Latino communities. However, as with all ""human"" delivered health programs, they impose constraints on participant schedules, and, even with careful intervention fidelity procedures in place, some variability in program delivery across advisors is inevitable. Computer-based culturally tailored physical activity advisor programs can potentially reduce human- to-human scheduling and fidelity constraints and extend program reach. In a recently completed 4- month experiment, a computer-based bilingual Virtual Advisor with touch-screen interactivity (no keyboard or mouse needed) was housed in a community center and programmed to tailor PA advice to the needs and preferences of low-income, aging Latino adults. The Virtual Advisor program successfully increased regular walking levels in participants compared to a health education control. OBJECTIVE: The primary study aim is to conduct a comparative effectiveness trial evaluating the 12- month impacts of the community-based Virtual Advisor PA program relative to a proven Lay Advisor program in a broader population of aging Latino adults. The secondary aim is to determine the comparative cost effectiveness of the Virtual vs. Lay Advisor programs. DESIGN: The 12-month randomized trial will enroll inactive Latino adults ages 55 years and older living near 16 neighborhood community centers (n=265/arm; 530 total). The primary outcome is minutes of walking per week, and additional outcomes of interest include BMI, sedentary behavior, functional performance, and health- related quality of life. Additional areas of investigation are to evaluate theoretically based and empirically supported moderators and mediators of intervention success and determine the potential generalizability of the interventions. IMPACT: The study seeks to demonstrate that a computer-based Virtual Advisor tailored to the needs of aging Latino adults can provide an effective and potentially cost-efficien alternative to Lay Advisors in community settings frequented by this population. The potential extended reach of such programs for use in a range of community settings (e.g., clinics, pharmacies, libraries) provides substantial promise for positively impacting the current health disparities gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there has been an explosion of computerized health promotion programs to increase regular physical activity-a key health behavior linked with the prevention and control of our nation's major killers--few have been adapted to the needs and preferences of low-income Latino adults. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based 'virtual lay advisor' relative to a proven human lay advisor program-both delivered at local community centers--in promoting regular walking among inactive midlife and older Latino adults. The Virtual Advisor program represents a potentially low-cost alternative to person-delivered health promotion programs that could be translated for use in a range of community settings (e.g., clinics, pharmacies, libraries).",Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Underserved Communities,8857153,R01HL116448,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Be element ', ' Beryllium ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Cues ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electronics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Walking ', ' Latino ', ' Promotor ', ' Promoters (Genetics) ', ' Promoter ', ' Promotor (Genetics) ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Trust ', ' bilingualism ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' health literacy ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' monetary value ', ' economic value ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' natural language ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,734771,0.0774292805521725
"Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diabetes incurs the most expensive annual chronic disease-related health care costs and certain ethnic groups, such as Latinos, are disproportionately affected by the burden of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Patients with T2DM also have comorbid chronic conditions that create complexities for proper management, and have implications for future research on integrating primary and behavioral care, particularly in dis- advantaged groups. Cost-effective, sustainable, and patient-centered adaptations of evidence-based approaches to chronic disease management are needed to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, low- resource communities. Integrated Health Care is the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians working together with patients and using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. This care may address mental health conditions, health behaviors, life stressors and crises, and clinical outcomes. Care integration is a cornerstone of effective integrated health care that leads to improved clinical and quality of life outcomes and reduces health-care costs and hospitalizations, especially in vulnerable populations. The goal of this project is to improve integrated care services at a federally-qualified Community Health Center (CHC). Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D), is a randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of an integrated behavioral health and primary cae chronic care disease management intervention for low income T2DM Latino patients with 2 or more chronic conditions accessing care within San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC). The study aims are to: 1) improve glycemic control, 2) improve cardiovascular risk profiles, 3) decrease psychological distress, and 4) evaluate the patient and provider acceptability and sustainability of the program. LUNA-D will recruit 414 non-insulin using adult T2DM patients with 2 or more chronic diseases. Half will be randomized to the Special Intervention (SI) and half to Usual Care (UC). The SI is a 3-month intensive intervention including fully integrated clinical visits with a mid-level provider (MLP) co-located with a behavioral health counselor (BHC) and peer-led evidence-based group health education sessions and proactive care coordination. Following the intense intervention period, the SI will receive booster sessions and fully integrated MLP/BHC clinical visits across 9 additional months. Usual Care is represented by passive appointments with the primary care physician and passive referrals to behavioral health and traditional health education. HbA1C measurements will be taken at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months to detect changes in glycemic control. Clinical lab measures, medication adherence, weight, health behaviors and psychosocial measures will also be obtained across the study. Demonstration of clinical improvement will support adoption by the SYHC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D) study, will conduct research that aims to reduce chronic disease disparities for disadvantaged Latino populations along the California-Mexico border region of the United States. LUNA-D proposes to test the ability of a fully integrated behavioral health and primary care multiple chronic disease management intervention in a federally-qualified community health care setting to

"Estimating the effects of Arizona-style omnibus immigration policies on Latino children???s access to health care ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino children have the worst health care access of any US citizen children1, 2 Restrictive state immigration policies may further exacerbate disparities. Omnibus immigration policies seek to increase immigration enforcement, restrict undocumented immigrants' access to services, and create criminal penalties for undocumented immigration.3, 4 Although these policies had immediate, drastic effects on communities,5 little is known about their effects on health care access for Latino children. Qualitative studies 6-10 indicate that omnibus policies reduce Latino children's health care access, regardless of parents' immigration status. Findings from the few quantitative studies that exist are mixed, however, and these studies suffer from weak study designs and non-representative samples.6,8,9 No studies have examined which aspects of health care access are most affected, how long effects last, or whether effects vary by individual or community characteristics. This study hypothesizes that (1) omnibus immigration policies reduce health care access for U.S. citizen Latino children, with effects that decline but do not disappear over time; (2) effects are greater for children of immigrants than for children of US- born parents; and (3) living in a county with a high proportion of Latinos attenuates effects. This study will use a comparative interrupted time series (CITS) design to estimate the effects of omnibus immigration policies on health care access for US citizen children of Latino descent up to four years after policies were passed. CITS is the most rigorous designs for evaluating health policy effects when a randomized controlled trial is not feasible.11 Data will come from the National Health Interview Survey and will include over 98,000 citizen Latino children in all 50 states over 14 year (2001-2014). The outcome measures will include the following indicators of health care access: dental and medical insurance coverage, use of preventive care, unmet health care needs, and regular source of care. Models will estimate immediate and long-term effects of policy passage on health care access. Interaction terms will be added to the models to test whether effects are moderated by parents' immigration status or by county Latino population. If sample sizes permit, analyses will be stratified by Latino national origin subgroup. Findings will have important policy implications. State immigration policies drive and set the course of immigration policy discussions at the federal level, and many state-level policies are eventually replicated at the national level.12 In the face of mounting pressure for immigration reform, it is critical to understand how immigration policies affect citizen children-both to steer policy in ways that protect children and to inform public health efforts to alleviate effects.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: In an environment of building anti-immigrant sentiment and increasing pressure for federal immigration reform, this study has significant policy relevance and impact. Six states have passed, and 24 other states have considered, restrictive omnibus immigration policies, which have the potential to further restrict health care access for already underserved Latino citizen youth. This study will provide guidance to policymakers for crafting policy that meets the demands of modern-day immigration and national security while protecting citizen children, and it will inform the design of public health interventions to alleviate any ill effects.            ",Estimating the effects of Arizona-style omnibus immigration policies on Latino children???s access to health care,9003117,R36HS024248,[''],AHRQ,UNIVERSITY OF TENNESSEE KNOXVILLE,R36,2015,39000,0.21230429977902301

Latino men are more likely to engage in unhealthy drinking than men in other racial/ethnic groups and their alcohol use increases with time spent in the United States. Despite these disparities, Latino immigrant men are unlikely to receive evidenced-based screening and brief intervention for unhealthy drinking due to their limited access to health care. We have culturally adapted a brief intervention for this population in order to broaden its reach and increase its efficacy. This stud will test the feasibility and efficacy of offering a culturally adapted intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking among Latino day laborers, who are particularly vulnerable to unhealthy drinking given their economic and social context. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the feasibility of offering screening and brief intervention to Latino day laborers delivered by community health workers (Promotores) at a day labor worker center; and 2) test the initial efficacy of the intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking using a randomized control group study design. Feasibility will be assessed through qualitative and quantitative assessments of recruitment, retention, reach, intervention fidelity, and participant satisfaction. We will assess changes in unhealthy drinking from baseline to eight weeks in both the intervention and the control group. We hypothesize that levels of unhealthy drinking will be lower in men in the intervention than the control group. The study uses several innovative approaches to address a significant health disparity in a high-risk and underserved population, including offering the intervention at a day labor worker center, using community health workers to deliver the brief intervention, and adapting the brief intervention to be more culturally relevat, and using tablets for data collection and providing personalized feedback. Findings will help determine the best methods for optimizing recruitment, data collection and intervention fidelity in a hard to reach population. If effective, screening and brief interventions could be implemented by community health workers in day labor worker centers nationwide, as well as a variety of other community settings. Given that Latinos are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the country, reducing unhealthy drinking in this population could have a significant public health impact by lowering rates of morbidity due to alcohol abuse and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer and unintentional injury. Furthermore, this novel intervention approach may also be generalizable to other health issues prevalent in the Latino immigrant community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test the feasibility and efficacy of screening and brief intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking among Latino immigrant men in a community setting. Reducing unhealthy drinking in the growing population of Latino immigrant men could have a significant public health impact by lowering rates of morbidity due to alcohol abuse and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer and unintentional injury.",Using Brief Interventions to Reduce Unhealthy Drinking Among Latino Day Laborers,8921928,R34AA022696,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Language ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social isolation ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' drinking ', ' social ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Community Health ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' screening and brief intervention ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R34,2015,287601,0.0674065814236708
"A Randomized Clinical Trial Of Culturally Tailored MI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the priority area Treatment for Health Disparities/Special Populations. Epidemiological and psychosocial research indicates that Latinos suffer greater adverse effects from hazardous drinking compared to other racial/ethnic groups, including higher rates of cirrhosis fatality and alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes. Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer alcohol-related health disparities, are less likely to initiate and to remai in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with high density of alcohol outlets. However, research on the field is challenged by the lack of studies comparing tailored to non-tailored treatments. We have pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905) demonstrating that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers. This study will be the basis for the current proposed study, which is a larger scale version of the pilot. The key modification was to incorporate social stressors in the context of acculturation. Thus, in the proposed study, we will also explore acculturation stress as an influence on the relationship between acculturation and alcohol consumption behavior. The public health impact of this study will be to develop a program of early screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous drinking among Latinos in communities that may lack such services. By providing early screening and intervention, we hope to minimize the burden of illness and social consequences that disproportionately affect Latino communities. Study Design: 357 Latino men and women who meet criteria for hazardous drinking (> 5/occasion for men, >4/occasion for women) will be recruited from the community. Following informed consent, they will complete a baseline assessment in either Spanish or English, and will then be randomized to receive either un-tailored motivational intervention (MI) or a culturally-tailored motivational intervention (CTMI). Participant randomization will be balanced by language preference, gender, alcohol severity, acculturation stress, and negative consequences, to ensure there is equivalent representation in each cell. Participants will be contacted by research assistants unaware of treatment assignment at 2, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Primary Aim 1: It is hypothesized that those randomized to receive the tailored treatment will report fewer alcohol- related negative consequences and fewer heavy drinking days at follow-up vs. those randomized to receive the un-tailored treatment. Primary Aim 2: Explore acculturation stress as a moderator of alcohol treatment outcomes. Long term goals: Develop a model of care that is easily disseminated in the community, and to generate theoretically-informed hypotheses to better understand how acculturation stress and processes confer risk for increased drinking among Latinos. We expect that this project will contribute needed knowledge about the role of acculturation stress in alcohol drinking behavior and treatment response. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer a greater burden of alcohol-related health disparities and negative social consequences compared to other racial/ethnic groups, are less likely to initiate and to remain in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with a high density of alcohol outlets. Pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905), which will serve as the basis for the current proposed larger-scale study, demonstrated that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers. The public health impact of this study will be to develop a program of early screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous drinking among Latinos, to minimize the burden of illness and social

"A Promotora Program to Prevent Primary Tooth Decay in Low-income Latino Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): KDH Research & Communication (KDHRC) proposes to develop and evaluate Dientes Fuertes, Vida Sana (DFVS), a culturally-competent program to prevent primary tooth decay in low-income Latino children ages zero to six. To effectively reach low-income Latino children, DFVS will train promotores de salud (PS) at Latino-serving community-based organizations (CBOs) to conduct outreach to Latino parents and guardians to build their knowledge and skills in 1) oral health literacy, including proper brushing, flossing, ad feeding practices to prevent primary tooth decay; and 2) oral healthcare system navigation, which includes when, where, and how to seek dental care and treatment and methods to overcome barriers to dental care.  DFVS addresses a pressing public health need. Public health officials have called tooth decay a silent epidemic and the greatest unmet childhood health need. On an individual level, childhood tooth decay predicts lasting and substantive physical, psychosocial, and economic consequences. On a societal level, childhood tooth decay costs taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars yearly, due mostly to emergency room care for preventable tooth pain. DFVS matches this pressing public health need with the PS intervention model, which has demonstrated effectiveness, culturally-competency, and cost-efficiency. DFVS is unique in the field.  At the completion of this project, we will have the complete DFVS program, which will consist of four bilingual English/Spanish components: 1) a Training Guide (TG) for a CBO-based facilitator to conduct eight, two-hour sessions to prepare PS to conduct outreach to Latino guardians; 2) a multi-part training telenovela, or streaming video that dramatically illustrates Latino oral health challenges for PS learning and discussion; 3) an Implementation Guide (IG) to build CBOs' capacity to effectively use DFVS; and 4) a distribution website to host DFVS. What is more, we will have substantive data on DFVS's effectiveness as a culturally-competent program to prevent primary tooth decay in low-income Latino children ages zero to six. These data will stem from two sources. First, the feasibility evaluation will explore the extent to which DFVS is a useful, culturally- appropriate program that CBOs will adopt. It will also test how exposure to the DFVS prototype changes PS' knowledge, improve attitudes, and increase self-efficacy to conduct outreach to Latino guardians. Second, the outcome evaluation will test DFVS in a two group, multi-stage, controlled trial of DFVS's effectiveness when implemented by a group of CBOs. Taken together, DFVS and its evaluation results aim to reduce oral health disparities among low-income Latino children ages zero to six by creating an evidence-based, culturally- competent program to prevent primary tooth decay. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: DFVS meets a pressing public health need. Public health officials have called tooth decay a silent epidemic and the greatest unmet childhood health need. Low-income Latino children are at particular risk of experiencing tooth decay and its lasting and substantive physical, psychosocial, and economic consequences. DFVS will address the costly public health problem of tooth decay in low-income Latino children using CBO- based PS as a culturally-competent method to build Latino guardians' knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and intentions in oral health literacy and oral healthcare system navigation. DFVS will be the only program of its kind and it thereby innovatively meets calls for interventions to prevent tooth decay in this vulnerable population.",A Promotora Program to Prevent Primary Tooth Decay in Low-income Latino Children,8900125,R44DE023713,"['Age ', ' Attitude ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' dental service ', ' Dental Procedure ', ' Dental Care ', ' tooth decay ', ' Dental Decay ', ' Caries ', ' Dental caries ', ' Economics ', ' Epidemic ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Market Research ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' dental health ', ' Oral health ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' teeth ', ' Tooth ', ' Tooth structure ', ' Temporary Tooth ', ' Primary Tooth ', ' deciduous tooth ', ' United States ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Dental ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' Letters ', ' bilingualism ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Hour ', ' Oral ', ' Stream ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Communication Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' feeding ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' dental caries prevention ', ' Caries prevention ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' public health relevance ', ' control trial ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDCR,"KDH RESEARCH AND COMMUNICATION, INC.",R44,2015,673521,-0.001594444682514801
"Kansas Community Cancer Health Disparities Network American Indian and Latino populations suffer from significant cancer disparities. Rural Al and Latino  communities, in geographically large states, such as Kansas, experience even greater access to cancer  screening and treatment disadvantage due to dispersion of specialists and facilities. The Kansas Community  Cancer Disparities Network (KCCDN) headquartered at the University of Kansas Medical Center will  concentrate on reaching rural Al and Latinos with innovative programs to improve knowledge, access and  utilization of beneficial biomedical and behavioral cancer procedures. Using community based participatory  research methods (CBPR) and linking our primary care research network (the Kansas Physicians Engaged  in Prevention Research, KPEPR) to our newly formed Midwest Cancer Alliance (MCA) hospital network, we  will improve outreach, research, and training on cancer disparities in two rural counties; Finney County (SW  Kansas; Latino) and Brown County (NE Kansas; Al). Our CNP Network will capitalize on thriving research  programs offered in our AHECS, Telemedicine Center and safety-net clinic system (Kansas Association for  the Medically Underserved, KAMU), and it will leverage strong and trusting relationships we have built while  providing service and collecting needs assessment data in both the regional Al and Latino communities.  Effective, standing community advisory boards (CABs) in each community were consulted directly during the  design and planning of this proposal and we have structured a CNP Network governance that assures  community interests come first. Our Outreach Core activities will build on the strengths available within the  MCA, KPEPR, and the Telemedicine Office and allow for expanded and improved education through  promotores, IT resources, and theory-driven strategic communications and a social marketing campaigns.  With direct input from rural partners we will conduct a rigorous and controlled clinical trial, testing the efficacy  of a novel intervention based on the ""implementation intentions"" construct to promote breast cancer  screening in Latina and Al women (PI, Engelman). Our Pilot Educational Project will utilize promotores and  ties to the MCA network to enhance knowledge, awareness and interest in cancer clinical trials among  targeted Al and Latino communities (PI, Cupertino). Our Training Core program will rest on a strong  foundation formed by our K30 clinical research curriculum program and an interdisciplinary T-32 fellowship  program (PI, Greiner) specifically designed to train health disparities researchers through community-based  research activities. Our KCCDN will succeed in reducing cancer disparities for Kansas' rural Latinos and  American Indians because it creates a vision for seamless blending access to care enhancements, culturally  tailored educational outreach, rigorous research, and junior investigator CBPR training. Using the building  blocks already in place, our model program will reach vulnerable minorities and generate disseminable  knowledge for the national CNP consortium.

"Innovative Physical Activity Interventions for Overweight Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the US and are disproportionately impacted by chronic conditions (e.g., overweight/obesity, diabetes) that can be mitigated by physical activity. While evidence-based programs are available to improve physical activity, dissemination is constrained by reliance on costly, limited resources. Short message service (SMS or text messaging) has strong potential as an intervention medium for Latinos, as they are dominant users of mobile phones and text messaging, including those with limited literacy and computer skills. We propose to develop a personalized, culturally-congruent and interactive SMS program to promote the adoption and maintenance of physical activity for overweight, underactive Latino adults and test it for comparable efficacy to an evidence-based telephone-based advising program that has been used successfully with Latinos. Grounded in Social Cognitive and Self-Determination Theories, both programs will include a core set of self-regulatory skill building, social support, and autonomous motivation enhancement, and will be tailored for cultural, linguistic and literacy appropriateness. Randomized at the individual level, 376 sedentary, overweight Latinos ages 45 years and older will be assigned to one of three arms: the SMS- delivered physical activity program, the Human-delivered physical activity program, or an attention-control arm of SMS-delivered basic healthful nutrition advice. They will receive their assigned program for 12 months, and then will be followed for a 6-month maintenance phase, with a final assessment at 18 months. Analyses will determine if the two physical activity programs result in equivalent efficacy in adoption and maintenance of clinically meaningful physical activity increases, and superiority over the attention-control arm at 12 and 18 months. The two physical activity interventions will also be compared for equivalency in prevention of weight gain and reduction in abdominal adiposity. We will explore the relative costs of the programs to determine which program increases physical activity for a lower cost. While health promotion programs delivered by professional staff may be more expensive than those delivered electronically, it is unclear if the automated version can produce more cost-efficient outcomes (i.e., comparable improvements in outcomes for significantly reduced cost). This study will determine if SMS is equivalent in efficacy to the traditional human-delivery channel in increasing physical activity and preventing weight gain, and if it results in a more cost-efficient program. If achieved, this research can significantly reduce health disparities associated with physical activity for Latinos by providing an efficacious tailored and culturally appropriate program poised for widespread dissemination and rapid uptake. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there has been a surge of electronic and mobile health promotion programs to increase regular physical activity (a key health behavior linked with the prevention and control of obesity and Type II Diabetes), few have been adapted to meet the needs and preferences of midlife and older Latinos. This research aims to investigate the effectiveness of an automated Simple Message Service (SMS, also known as text messaging) advisor system relative to a proven human advisor program to promote regular, sustained physical activity among inactive, overweight Latinos.

"Caminamos: A location-based Smartphone App for Latinas to Connect with Nearby Walking Partners ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health disparities are high among Latinas. They are more likely to be overweight, diagnosed with diabetes, and physically inactive compared to their non-Hispanic White counterparts. Thus, interventions that target improving health access and ameliorating chronic diseases among Latinas are of high public health importance. Regular physical activity (PA) promotes physical and emotional well-being, yet PA interventions tailored for Latinas remain limited. Available data suggest that community-focused interventions produce improvements in physical activity (PA) and are well-received by Latinas especially when social and physical environments are considered (e.g., social support, safe walking areas, etc.). Research suggests that Latinos respond favorably to technological-based health interventions. Almost 90 percent of Latinos own a cellphone; 60 percent own a smartphone. Thus, health promotion interventions that can address Latinos' preferences regarding their physical and social environments while utilizing a preferred technology source (e.g., smartphone) could prove highly successful. One smartphone feature that offers great potential health promotion benefit is location- based services (LBS). LBS use geographic positioning to help users connect to their surrounding environment and to other users, thus providing them with real-time, user-specific information. This proposed project, ¡Caminamos!, will develop a smartphone app for use with 18-45 year old Latinas that uses LBS to connect women within geographically proximal neighborhoods as a way to provide social support for increased walking behaviors. Specific aims are: (1) gather input and evaluative feedback from an Expert Advisory Board (EAB) to help plan and assess the feasibility of creating the app; (2) build connections and gather input from Latino community leaders to assist in the conceptual development of the app through a Community Advisory Board (CAB); (3) conduct an online survey of a national sample of Latinas on their smartphone usage for health promotion, and interest in social networking and LBS technology features; (4) conduct iterative focus groups with Latinas age 18-45 years to guide development of app content, design, and aesthetics to fully develop a functioning prototype; and (5) conduct usability testing with Latinas to test the app's accuracy to establish users' location and connect users through the ¡Caminamos! system and users' use and satisfaction with the app. Few app-based health products are branded towards Latinas. ¡Caminamos! will address this unmet need in the marketplace. It will be the first smartphone app that uses location-based social networking to promote PA, and the only app of its kind targeted to Latinas. It will also expand upon what is known to be successful in Latino exercise engagement while simultaneously addressing key barriers to exercise. Phase I outcomes will provide the necessary framework and data for developing a full-scale app to be tested in a randomized clinical trial. In Phase III, we plan to market ¡Caminamos! directly to consumers in partnership with a company interested in expanding their brand outreach to a Latina population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Despite numerous interventions designed to increase physical activity, few are specifically tailored to Latinas, a population where higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases are present. This proposed smartphone app will use location-based services to connect Latinas with one another in order to improve walking habits by increasing social support and decreasing perceived barriers, both of which are known to play a role in physical activity behaviors. In this Phase I research, surveys of potential end users will determine interest in the app and focus groups will help shape a prototype of the app, which will be developed and tested to determine feasibility and functionality for a randomized Phase II intervention.",Caminamos: A location-based Smartphone App for Latinas to Connect with Nearby Walking Partners,8904136,R43MD009652,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Beauty ', ' Behavior ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Esthetics ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Feedback ', ' Female ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Influentials ', ' Marketing ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Walking ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Shapes ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Life ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' information gathering ', ' outreach ', ' novel technologies ', ' new technology ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' heart disease risk ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIRS (R43/44) ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' usability ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' ']",NIMHD,"KLEIN BUENDEL, INC.",R43,2015,189295,0.05189879689235096
"A Multi-Ethnic Faith and Public Health Partnership to Reduce Health Disparities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Congregational involvement has been promoted as a way to help reduce health disparities among African Americans and Latinos in the U.S; however, the multifaceted health needs found in many urban areas, as well as the complex set of factors leading to health inequalities, mean that broad and sustainable, multi- ethnic, multi-denominational faith and health partnerships are needed. The goal of this project is to build a network of African-American and Latino congregational leaders, public health partners, and researchers to jointly reduce disparities in South Los Angeles (LA). The specific aims of the project are: 1) Develop a sustainable faith and public health partnership to build capacity to address health disparities experienced by Latinos and African Americans; 2) Jointly develop an intervention to leverage congregational and public health resources toward the goal of reducing disparities in outcomes for Latinos and African Americans for an identified health condition; 3) Pilot test the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention among African American and Latino congregations. The specific health condition and intervention strategy used will be defined by a Steering Committee composed of key denominational and inter-denominational associations and public health entities serving South Los Angeles, together with researchers at the RAND Corporation and its primary community partner, Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches (LAM); based on initial input, the focus will likely be on one of three health issues: cancer, obesity, or HIV. The study will be collaborative throughout all stages, and we will develop strategies to strengthen the partnership's capacity to address health disparities beyond the focus on this initial condition. The partnership is innovative in bringing together religious, public health, and research organizations to address health disparities jointly and in using novel techniques for soliciting community input. Further, it emphasizes mutual capacity building and sustainability so that researchers are better able to design and evaluate interventions; congregations gain knowledge about community health issues and skills in conducting health programs; and public health practitioners contribute to and learn from the development of best practices in promoting community health.         RELEVANCE: This will be the first multi-ethnic, multi-denominational faith and public health research partnership that aims to reduce health disparities in an on-going and interactive fashion and using novel techniques to obtain community input. This effort will lead to an in-depth understanding of diverse faith community perspectives on health disparities and the potential for addressing them through congregation-based programming.

"Reducing Barriers to Autism Care in Latino Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis improves long-term child development and families' ability to cope with this disorder. Latino children are diagnosed with ASDs at older ages and at the point of more severe symptoms, putting them and their families at significant disadvantage. Interventions addressing family, community, and health care systems factors hold promise for improving access to ASD diagnostic services for minority children. The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to reduce ethnic differences in ASD care among Latinos. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a survey of 350 Latino parents of either typically-developing children or children with ASDs, to assess common beliefs about autism in Latino communities, and to assess which community factors, health beliefs, and health care system factors are associated with delays in ASD diagnosis. The survey will be conducted at three sites within the Autism Treatment Network: Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon; University of Colorado/The Children's Hospital in Denver; and University of Pennsylvania/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Based on the barriers found in the survey, we will develop a pilot community-based patient navigator intervention designed to reduce barriers to care. This research will be incorporated into a career development plan that includes increasing the Principal Investigator's knowledge and skills in the areas of autism diagnosis and treatment, mental health disparities, interventional study design, and community-based research. The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and used as the basis for an NIH-funded proposal to conduct a multi-site test of the intervention designed in this project. Over 120,000 U.S. Latino children have been diagnosed with an ASD, a figure that likely underestimates the true prevalence. This project will help such children achieve earlier diagnosis and better long-term prognosis. The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to improve rates of early diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders in Latino children. We will achieve this goal through surveying Latino parents to identify barriers to care and then developing a pilot patient navigator intervention designed to reduce the barriers that we identified.

"Life Course Socioeconomics, Acculturation, & Type-2 Diabetes Risk Among Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos in the US carry a disproportionate burden of type-2 diabetes. Research has implicated life course socioeconomic position as a major factor in the development of chronic diseases, such as type-2 diabetes; yet most evidence is limited to non-Hispanic White populations. We hypothesize that the large disparities in type-2 diabetes among Latinos reflects the joint effect of intergenerational transmission of socioeconomic factors, cultural characteristics, behaviors, biology, and other risk factors accumulating over the life course. The experience of Latinos in the US represents an especially fruitful context in which to investigate the influence of life course socioeconomic and cultural resources in relation to type-2 diabetes. In addition to being the fastest growing minority population with high rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes, the experience of Latinos is one that includes first generation immigrants with limited education and job skills, and later generations who are born and raised in the US and show varying levels of acculturation and assimilation, behavioral change, and socioeconomic advancement. With these unique considerations in mind, the present study seeks to: (1) examine the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; (2) assess whether acculturation modifies the impact of life course socioeconomic position on type-2 diabetes among Latinos; and 3) examine whether metabolic and inflammatory markers related to behavioral, physiological, and psychosocial risk factors mediate the relationships between life course socioeconomic position, acculturation, and type-2 diabetes among Latinos. The proposed research activity will constitute the first systematic attempt to assess the unique and synergistic contributions of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type 2 diabetes among Latinos. By assessing life course exposures across two generations of Latinos living in the US, this project provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify targets for early intervention for reducing the heavy burden of type-2 diabetes among Latinos. More broadly, the proposed research may uncover crucial life course socioeconomic and cultural patterning of risk factors or health promoting characteristics that may also benefit other race/ethnic minorities disproportionately living in poverty and suffering from type-2 diabetes. The proposed study will assess the impact of life course socioeconomic position and acculturation on type-2 diabetes and examine potential biological mediators, including inflammation, among two generations of US Latinos. The findings from this study will have important public health implications, including identification of critical risk facors and biological mechanisms mediating the effects of life course sociocultural contexts on type-2 diabetes across generations of US Latinos.","Life Course Socioeconomics, Acculturation, & Type-2 Diabetes Risk Among Latinos",8849896,R01DK087864,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Aging ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cultural Characteristics ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Assimilations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Research Activity ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' ob/ob mouse ', ' Obese Protein ', ' Obese Gene Product ', ' Ob Protein ', ' Ob Gene Product ', ' Leptin ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Life ', ' apM1 (adipose-specific) protein ', ' apM-1 protein ', ' adipocyte, C1q and collagen domain containing protein ', ' adipocyte complement-related protein 30-kDa ', ' ACRP30 protein ', ' adiponectin ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Adult Children ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' diabetes risk ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Mind ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2015,569393,0.14100549039206767
"Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance Abstract  The purpose of the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA) is to ameliorate the lack of highly qualified first-generation-educated Latino graduates prepared to engage in graduate degrees in health disparities research in both biomedical and health science-related disciplines. Latinos have been and continue to be gravely underrepresented in the biomedical, behavioral, clinical, and social science disciplines. In 2009 Latinos made up fewer than 5% of all medical scientists, despite being 15.8% of the US population, the largest minority group. Although Latinos represent a growing proportion of college admissions, they continue to lag behind in enrollment and degree completion (Becerra 2010). Entry-level science courses (e.g. chemistry, biology) tend to eliminate Latinos students from advancement in science degrees. In response to this critical educational deficit, and with support from the NIMHD Science Education Initiative, the NCLR/CSULB Center for Latino Community Health, Evaluation, and Leadership Training, will develop the Hispanic Health Opportunity Learning Alliance (HOLA).  HOLA will provide health disparities research training and tutoring in science to Latino students in their sophomore and junior years, thus widening the pool of minority applicants for advanced degrees. Moreover, HOLA will be open to students across the natural and health sciences reaching out to pre-health majors who otherwise would not be eligible to participate in existing research opportunities.  HOLA will provide 140 Latino undergraduate students and 30 minority graduate students with educational, mentoring, and career development opportunities designed to facilitate careers in health disparities research through the delivery of: 1) targeted undergraduate tutoring in diverse science courses for Latino pre-health and health science students; 2) workshops in health disparities research methods; 3) health disparities seminars highlighting population-specific issues; and, 4) an annual health disparities conference.

"Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino population has experienced a dramatic increase over the past decade, making it the largest minority group in the United States (US). Along with this surge in numbers Latinos also face greater challenges in accessing health care compared to the general population. These health disparities, which are particularly salient among Latina women, make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors that affect the disproportionate numbers of people suffering from HIV/AIDS and substance abuse in this population. Our long term goal is therefore to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventual elimination of HIV/AIDS and substance abuse health disparities among Latinos. The proposed Center will expand on the activities of our current P-20 NIMHD C-SALUD located at Florida International University (FlU). C-SALUD will focus its research, training, and community collaboration activities with Latinos in Miami-Dade County, a county that not only houses a high concentration of Latinos but also has the dubious distinction of having one of the highest rates of HIV, cocaine related deaths, and emergency room admissions in the U.S. The proposed continuing C-SALUD will build on ongoing collaborations with community based organizations which have a longstanding history of providing health and social services to Latinos at risk for HIV and substance abuse as well as other underserved Latino populations in South Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: Administrative, Research, Research Education /Training, and Community Partnership/Engagement. The target population will be Latinos, particularly Latina women residing in Miami-Dade County with a focus on Latina farm workers ages 18 and older and recent Latina immigrants who have lived in the U.S. less than one year, ages 18-23. These two Latino subgroups are at high risk for HIV and have been impacted by the HIV epidemic. We anticipate that partnerships between C-SALUD researchers and the Miami-Dade County Latino community, will lead to the development of new collaborative strategies for researchers, CBOs, and the Latino community at large to work together more effectively in reducing and eliminating HIV and substance abuse health disparities among Latinos.             The Center is expected to enhance our understanding of the role that social and cultural determinants of health have on the substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors of Latinos, particular Latinas. This knowledge is expected to lead to the development and refinement of culturally relevant and evidence-based HIV prevention strategies available to HIV-uninfected/infected individuals and users of substances among Latinos who are disproportionately affected by the HIV/AIDS and substance abuse epidemics in the U.S.",Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States,8885513,P20MD002288,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' 8-Azabicyclo(3.2.1)octane-2-carboxylic acid, 3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-, methyl ester, (1R-(exo,exo))- ', ' Cocaine ', ' Communities ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemic ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Housing ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Dissemination ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Migrant Workers ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' HRSA ', ' United States Health Resources and Services Administration ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Training ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Development Plans ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Staging ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' social integration ', ' cohort ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Prevention ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' social ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Modeling ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' medically underserved population ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' flu ', ' eighteen year old ', ' age 18 years ', ' 18 year old ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' doctoral student ', ' ']",NIMHD,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,P20,2015,1145090,0.07083353189704256
"Health Communication & Health Literacy to Improve Care for Latinos with Diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diabetes disparities are common for Latino patients. Effective health communication can potentially narrow these disparities. This proposal details a career development plan that will prepare the principal investigator (PI) for success as an independent investigator with expertise in diabetes-related outcomes, health communication, and delivery of behavioral interventions for Latino diabetes patients. As an Internal Medicine- Pediatrics physician, with training in clinical investigation, the PI will gain new skills through this K23 in the areas of health disparities specific to diabetes care, enhanced Latino cultural competency, audio taping clinical encounters to assess the quality and role of health communication, and the development of a new training program for medical interpreters. The PI's immediate goals are to rigorously examine the quality of health communication between Latino diabetes patients, providers, and Spanish interpreters and the association between health communication and various diabetes-related health outcomes. To meet this goal, the PI has proposed a rigorous career development plan that incorporates additional didactic course work, regular participation in local and national meetings/seminars, a mentored research experience, and active involvement in an extremely supportive research environment. This includes an NIDDK funded Diabetes Research and Training Center (DRTC), NCRR-funded Meharry Clinical and Translational Research Center (MeTRC), Vanderbilt Program on Effective Health Communication (EHC), and an RCMI-funded Bioinformatics Core. The research specific aims are to: 1) conduct a cross-sectional, descriptive mixed-methods analysis of the quality of health communication between providers and Latino diabetes patients with particular emphasis on the role of the Spanish medical interpreter during language discordant encounters, and explore the association between baseline quality of health communication and various diabetes related health outcomes, 2) conduct an observational cohort study to examine the independent effect of provider health communication training and the use of a Spanish, literacy-sensitive educational toolkit on the quality of health communication during medical encounters, and assess the association between changes in the quality of health communication at 12 months with changes in diabetes related health outcomes, and 3) develop and pilot in a small RCT, an enhanced training program for Spanish medical interpreters geared toward improving their ability to work with providers and patients with LEP and limited health literacy during language discordant encounters. Overall, this K23 program will provide important insights into the nature of health communication with Latinos, the role of Spanish interpreters in this process, and most importantly prepare the PI for independent investigation of the role of effective health communication in addressing disparities in care for Latinos with diabetes. Effective health communication can potentially improve diabetes care and clinical outcomes for Latino patients. This K23 award will allow the PI to gain expertise in the evaluation of the quality of health communication during clinical encounters between Latino patients, providers, and Spanish medical interpreters and in the delivery of effective behavioral diabetes interventions.",Health Communication & Health Literacy to Improve Care for Latinos with Diabetes,8852600,K23DK092470,"['Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Control Groups ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Internal Medicine ', ' Language ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Systems Analyses ', ' Systems Analysis ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Uninsured ', ' Roter ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Clinic ', ' meetings ', ' diabetes education ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Controlled Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Health Communication ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' NCRR ', ' National Center for Research Resources ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' health literacy ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' safety net ', ' translational sciences center ', ' translational research center ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' clinical care ', ' ']",NIDDK,MAYO CLINIC  JACKSONVILLE,K23,2015,133730,0.08919211171024823
"Johns Hopkins Healthy Eyes Translational Research Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this cooperative agreement is to assess and evaluate system level and individual level factors that impact access to eye care; and to identify barriers and enablers to the delivery of eye care conforming to best practices that prevent vision loss and promote eye health. The Johns Hopkins Translational Research Center (TRC) will analyze multiple existing databases to develop a knowledge base for a public health interventions aimed at reducing healthcare disparities and improving the eye health of underserved populations in the United States. Specifically, we will focus on focus on cataract, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Finally, we propose a collaborative study that uses this knowledge for implementation at the city level. The first set of analyses will focus on personal and perceived system barriers associated with the uptake of eyecare services in three previously studied populations: African Americans and Caucasians from the Salisbury Eye Evaluation (SEE) study and Latinos living in Arizona (studied as part of Proyecto Ver) and Latinos living in Baltimore (evaluated in the ProVision study funded by the NIH). The barriers and enablers of obtaining cataract surgical services will be assessed in all three racial/ethnic groups, whereas factors related to screening for diabetic retinopathy will be addressed using the two Latino populations, supplemented with analyses of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). Finally, the rates of glaucoma screening provided using the Medicare screening benefit as well as the rates and patterns of treatment of glaucoma will be assessed using data from Medicare. Additionally, NHANES has both visual field and optic nerve imaging and these data will be used to determine associations with having been diagnosed with glaucoma when it is present in order to identify groups at high risk for underdiagnosis. The proposed TRC network combined project will consist of establishing diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening surveillance systems in collaboration with city governments to be able to monitor patterns of care, especially among at risk underserved populations. An intervention will be tested to increase DR screening rates based on the findings of the analyses described above. Finally, a pre/post assessment will be made to see if the intervention might be expanded nationally. Project Narrative This study is highly relevant to the public health. Findings from this research will inform policy planners and insurance administrators of key barriers and enablers associated with the major blinding eye conditions faced by minority populations in the United States.

"Disclosure Preferences of Older Latinos with Advanced Cancer & their Caregivers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Meeting the communication needs and preferences of advanced cancer patients and their families is central to the delivery of quality care and speaks directly to the mission and programmatic goals of the National Institute of Nursing Research regarding palliative care, health disparities and this specific PA-11-182. However, little is known about the perceptions and preferences of older U.S. Latinos with cancer, one of the fastest growing segments of the older population and their family caregivers regarding the delivery of bad news. Evidence based guidelines regarding the communication of bad news are also limited, particularly for multicultural populations. Not knowing these preferences may hinder effective communication between providers and patients, an established ingredient for improving patient outcomes, as well as the use and quality of palliative care services. Guided by the Andersen, Aday Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization the primary aim is to examine the association between behavioral, affective, cognitive and macro dimensions of culture and the disclosure and communication preferences of older Latinos with advanced cancer, and whether this association is moderated by key clinical, demographic and psychosocial factors. The study will also compare Latino cancer patients' disclosure preferences to those of their Anglo counterparts, as well as preferences between patients and caregivers in both groups. Survey participants will be 150 (100 Latino and 50 Anglo) older advanced cancer patients (stage 3 or 4 with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic cancer) and 150 of their family caregivers. Using phenomenological interviews with a subsample of 20 Latino patients and 20 of their family caregivers, the study will explore and describe in-depth Latino patient and caregiver communication preferences regarding the content, style and timing of diagnostic and prognostic information, as well as perceptions and experiences that elucidate the context of their preferences within culture. Finally, the study will assess the concordance between patients' preferences and their self- reported actual experiences when they were first told they had cancer. The study will address critical knowledge gaps in bioethics research related to the tension between the principles of autonomy and beneficence in different cultures. It will be the first to identify the disclosure preferences of Latino patients and families using a unique approach which departs from the conventional notion that autonomy-based preferences are universal. It will also be the first to assess multiple dimensions of Latino culture in the area of health disparities in palliative care using mixed methods. A better understanding of patient and caregiver disclosure preferences will provide crucial information needed for future interventions, evidence-based guidelines, and enhancing vital provider-patient/family communication and care provided to older Latinos with advanced cancer and their families. Findings will also help inform approaches to the return of results to Latino cancer research participants and others with life limiting illnesses in our increasingly diverse, multicultural society.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about the preferences of older U.S. Latinos with advanced cancer and their families regarding the communication of bad news related to their cancer. Not knowing their preferences may prevent good communication between providers and patients and negatively affect important patient outcomes. This study will determine how various dimensions of culture influence the preferences of older Latinos with advanced cancer regarding the communication of information about their diagnosis and prognosis. The study promises to provide crucial information for developing future studies, evidence-based guidelines and improving the palliative care provided to one of our most vulnerable groups, older Latinos with cancer.            ",Disclosure Preferences of Older Latinos with Advanced Cancer & their Caregivers,8970485,R21NR014305,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Benevolence ', ' Beneficence ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Bioethics ', ' Canada ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Elements ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Italy ', ' Latin America ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Portugal ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Spain ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' prognostic ', ' Distress ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' European ', ' news ', ' Staging ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Locally Advanced Cancer ', ' Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Recurrent Malignant Tumor ', ' Recurrent Cancer ', ' Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R21,2015,240512,0.06921193983682432
"HIV Testing & Latino MSM: Individual, Sociocultural, and Structural Determinants. ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project, titled ""HIV Testing & Latino MSM: Individual, Sociocultural and Structural Determinants,"" aims to determine combinations of individual, sociocultural, and community-level factors that must be targeted within different subgroups of adult Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (LMSM) to maximize efficacy of HIV testing prevention efforts. Many HIV positive LMSM are unaware of their infection. Lack of awareness of HIV serostatus leads to an increased likelihood of HIV transmission and perpetuation of the overall HIV/AIDS heath disparity affecting Latinos in the United States. The overarching goal of this research is to improve participation of LMSM in HIV testing initiatives [e.g., Seek-Test-Treat-Retain (STTR) interventions] by increasing our scientifi understanding of within-LMSM group differences in obtaining HIV testing. The proposed three-year prospective study will (a) use latent class analysis to empirically identify typologies of 415 adult LMSM (aged 18 years and older) based on their individual, sociocultural, and structural- level factors and (b) determine whether and to what extent rates of HIV testing differ by subgroup, while accounting for recognized demographic covariates. Our conceptual model and hypotheses account for well- established individual, social, and cultural determinants of HIV testing. Proposed hypotheses will be tested using data obtained from rigorous Internet-based data collection procedures. Participant recruitment will occur via targeted online social networking groups (e.g., dating and general interest groups) and community-based agencies serving LMSM in upstate New York, New York City, and four other metropolitan areas in which HIV prevalence among Latino males is highest in the United States (Miami, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston). Our research team, including community based investigators and undergraduate health disparities research fellows, is well-poised to implement the proposed project. The proposed study builds upon the investigators' prior work on individual, sociocultural, and structural determinants of HIV risk and related behaviors among Latinos; HIV prevention and health promotion among sexual minorities; sexual identity development theory; advanced statistical analyses, and longitudinal designs. Findings will have high public health importance because they will inform the next generation of HIV testing campaigns of novel facilitators of HIV testing. Results also will highlight subgroups (based on determinants of testing) of LMSM-an underserved population that is affected by delayed HIV testing and late entry to care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent public health efforts to prevent HIV infection emphasize a seek, test, and treat (STNT) approach. The STNT initiative posits that increasing the number of at-risk persons who are aware of their HIV-positive status, and treating them with antiretroviral drugs, should curtail the number of new HIV infections. The findings from our proposed study will inform future development of the next generation of HIV testing initiatives for Latino gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (LMSM). The study is expected to yield significant public health knowledge concerning understudied barriers and facilitators to HIV testing among LMSM. By increasing our scientific understanding of within-LMSM group differences in obtaining HIV testing, we can take future steps to improve participation of LMSM in HIV STNT interventions.

"Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 proposal is to develop a culturally tailored nutrition communication intervention for primary prevention of breast cancer among bicultural Latinas. The overarching goal of the study is to advance understanding of how communication and acculturation processes influence cancer risk behaviors in order to design effective culturally tailored interventions to reduce cancer risk behaviors. This approach is particularly relevant when considering research on the health of the population of CA's San Joaquin Valley (SJV). A vast, largely rural region that produces over half of the nation's fruit, nuts, and vegetables, SJV is 50% Latino, mostly of Mexican origin6. The SJV has a very diverse Latino population: 25% are foreign-born, and their primary language may be an indigenous Mexican language rather than Spanish, while 75% are native-born U.S. citizens, who possess varied fluency in English abilities and whose families may include both legal and undocumented immigrants. The linguistic and acculturative diversity of this population poses new challenges for understanding how to design effective behavior change interventions. Most community-based interventions with Latinos have focused on those who speak Spanish exclusively, limiting our understanding of how acculturation and linguistic diversity impact communication intervention design and effectiveness. mHealth strategies offer a way of delivering interventions that are not only culturally appropriate for Latinos across the acculturation spectrum, but also appropriate for primary cancer prevention among young adults who are eager adopters of technology. This study aims to fill the knowledge gaps through a research plan designed around three sequential aims employing mixed methods for message testing and community intervention research. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with SJV Latinas (N=25) to explore factors that influence diet and food preparation behaviors as well as barriers and facilitators to the adoption of healthier diets. Results will inform the content categories for message tailoring, the structure of the messages, and the means of dissemination. In Aim 2, we will use the findings from Aim 1 to build and test a library of messages that are culturally appropriate for bicultural Latinas using focus groups and cognitive interviews. Aim 3 is the design, pilot test, and evaluation of an intervention to improve diet behaviors. The intervention consists of a series of culturally appropriate messages, developed in Aim 2, tailored to each participant's needs and preferences, to be disseminated via mobile phone over a 4-week period. We will evaluate preliminary outcomes (e.g., usage and feedback about the intervention and changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions) at four different times. We will determine preliminary estimates of effect size for behavioral outcomes (consumption of dietary fat, fruits and vegetables), based on two post-intervention data collections. We will additionally evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability in order to refine the intervention for a future larger randomized controlled trial, to be proposed in an R01 application before the end of this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The demographic and risk factor profiles for Latinos suggest a looming cancer epidemic: Latinos are younger, poorer, and less likely to have access to cancer screening than the general population. The ""Acculturation Paradox"" further suggests that acculturation is a risk factor for diet-related breast cancer risk. This project aims to improve eating behaviors as a primary cancer prevention strategy, and the emphasis on young adult, bicultural Latinas focuses on those at high preventable cancer risk. The overall goals of this career development grant are to improve understanding of (a) factors that influence Latinas' cancer-related behaviors that may be modifiable through communication-based strategies, and (b) factors that influence Latinas' communication preferences and intervention effectiveness, in order to inform a culturally appropriate mHealth intervention.",Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas,8968108,K01CA190659,"['Immigrant ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Pattern ', ' Eating ', ' Categories ', ' good diet ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' Overweight ', ' Car Phone ', ' Structure ', ' base ', ' Vegetables ', ' evaluation/testing ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Native-Born ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Language ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Libraries ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Linguistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Resources ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' California ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' nutrition ', ' Nuts ', ' Obesity ', ' Health ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Fruit ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Behavior ', ' post intervention ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native People ', ' mHealth ', ' Research Resources ', ' Mortality ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' population health ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' effective intervention ', ' Acculturation ', ' malignancy ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' Cancers ', ' therapy design ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' designing ', ' Latinas ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Cognitive ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Outcome ', ' Appalachia ', ' 21+ years old ', ' design ', ' Adult Human ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' adulthood ', ' Population ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' interventional strategy ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Legal ', ' dietary ', ' dietary lipid ', ' Food Intake ', ' Death ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' dietary fruit ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Fats ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' cancer disparity ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer care ', ' career development ', ' Individual ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home environment ', ' Latina ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' young adult ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' food preparation ', ' mammary cancer prevention ', ' mammary tumor prevention ', ' Home ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Over weight ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Feedback ', ' Family ', ' experience ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' behavior change ', ' Health Technology ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' tool ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' General Public ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, MERCED",K01,2015,126865,0.023015295420747706
"Latino vs. Non-Latino Disparities in Advance Care Planning & End-of-Life Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this project, we aim to explain and reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in advance care planning (ACP) and end-of-life (EOL) care. Latino advanced cancer patients are less likely than non-Latino advanced cancer patients to engage in ACP - a practice to help terminally ill patients and their families achieve EOL goals of care. Consistent with this disparity in ACP, Latino advanced cancer patients receive aggressive, burdensome EOL care more often than do their non-Latino counterparts. They are also less likely than others to use hospice services and to receive EOL care in line with their preferences. Consequently, the EOL care that Latino advanced cancer patients receive appears to be suboptimal, inferior to the care that non-Latino patients receive, infrequently guided by ACP, and often counter to their values. In this project, we will address these disparities in ACP & EOL care through two closely related sub-projects. In the first of these sub-projects, we aim to identify beliefs that contribute to Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care (Specific Aim 1). We will conduct an observational study of beliefs, ACP and EOL outcomes in 400 advanced cancer patients (N=200 Latino; N=200 non-Latino) and their informal caregivers (e.g., spouses; N=400) whom we will recruit from clinics in New York City, Dallas, and Chicago. In this observational study, we will examine the extent to which religious, familial and cultural medical beliefs mediate or moderate Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care, and identify significantly influential beliefs as potential targets of an intervention to reduce those disparitis. In the second sub-project, using results from this observational study as a guide, we aim to develop and pilot a belief-contextualization intervention to reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care (Specific Aim 2). Specific Aim 2 will proceed in three phases. In Phase I, we will briefly review results of Specific Aim 1 and ask Latino stakeholders to provide input on possible belief-contextualization interventions to determine those likely to be most effective in, and acceptable to, Latino communities. In Phase II, we will design a belief-contextualization intervention to reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care that incorporates elements identified in Phase I and then vet that intervention with a separate group of Latino stakeholders. In Phase III, we will evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of the belief-contextualization intervention developed in Phase II. Overall, results of this study will identify influential beliefs that explain Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care, and offer the promise of an effective approach to the reduction of Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP, and, ultimately, EOL care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Latino and non-Latino (White and Black) Americans. Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, and are less likely than their non-Latino counterparts to engage in advance care planning (ACP). They are also more likely to receive aggressive, burdensome end-of-life (EOL) care at odds with their cultural beliefs. Consequently, there is a pressing need to address Latino/non-Latino disparities in cancer ACP and EOL care. Identification and targeting of influential beliefs about medical care is expected to reduce disparities in ACP and EOL care. It will, thus, reduce disparities in the quality of the medical decision-making and care Latino cancer patients receive near death.",Latino vs. Non-Latino Disparities in Advance Care Planning & End-of-Life Care,8934132,R01MD007652,"['advanced directive ', ' Advance Directives ', ' Affect ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Influentials ', ' living will ', ' Living Wills ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Resuscitation ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Terminally Ill ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Intensive Care ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Trust ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Health Care Power of Attorney ', ' Healthcare Power of Attorney ', ' Inferior ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' cancer pain ', ' authority ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Secrecy ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' palliative ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' ']",NIMHD,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2015,414740,0.13972987082743124
"Culturally-Sensitive School-Home Behavioral Program for Latino Children with ADHD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research and training plan aims to provide the applicant with experience implementing and analyzing Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity-Impulsivity Disorder (ADHD) clinical trials, utilizing qualitative methodolog to determine meaningful themes and develop culturally sensitive guidelines for diverse families in need of mental health services, expanding multicultural competence and sensitivity, and advancing independence as a clinical researcher. ADHD is one of the most common childhood mental health disorders across cultures, with the continuously growing Latino youth population displaying as great or greater risk for ADHD. Latino children experience unfortunate mental health disparities leaving them less likely to seek and receive appropriate ADHD services, which can prevent long-lasting and widespread impairment in the areas of academic, social, and familial functioning related to ADHD. In order to reduce mental health disparities for Latino children, the field is in need of culturally-sensitive clinical psychologists trained to conduct intervention research and develop guidelines for culturally appropriate ADHD services. The training proposed in the current plan will set the stage for the applicant's career as an independent clinical researcher focused on developing, investigating, and disseminating culturally-appropriate assessment and treatment practices for children with ADHD. These goals not only serve as priorities for the applicant, but also appeal to two of the four current National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) objectives (i.e., developing new and better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs and circumstances of people with mental illnesses and strengthening the public health impact of NIMH-supported research).  The sponsor, Dr. Linda Pfiffner, is an established clinical researcher who has served as the principal investigator of multiple ADHD clinical trials, including the current Department of Education (DOE) funded efficacy trial of Collaborative Life Skills (CLS) Program- the intervention proposed in the current research/training plan. The co-sponsor, Dr. Patricia Arean, has extensive experience with multicultural clinical psychology, including clinical/research work with Latino Americans. The mentorship of the sponsors, as well as the training resources available at UCSF, provide the ideal opportunity for the applicant to complete the proposed research and training plan and achieve the following specific aims:  Aim 1) Compare Latino and non-Latino families recruited for and participating in ADHD services at all levels of the help-seeking behavior model.  Aim 2) Conduct mixed-method investigation with Latino families participating in CLS and develop culturally- sensitive guidelines for ADHD behavioral treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although Latino children (who are expected to comprise one quarter of the youth population by 2050) are at as great or greater risk for displaying ADHD, Latino children are under-diagnosed and underserved compared to non-Latino children. Investigation of differential response to existing evidence-based treatments for ADHD and subsequent development of culturally-sensitive guidelines may increase problem recognition, encourage decision to seek appropriate help, and improve completion of, satisfaction with, and outcomes from service utilization to ultimately reduce the mental health disparities between Latino and non-Latino children with ADHD.",Culturally-Sensitive School-Home Behavioral Program for Latino Children with ADHD,8913845,F32MH101971,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' Parents ', ' Psychologist ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' San Francisco ', ' Schools ', ' Social Workers ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Competence ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' teacher ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Motor Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperkinetic Movements ', ' Hyperkinesis ', ' Hyperkinesia ', ' Hyperactivity ', ' Hyperactive behavior ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Services ', ' skills training ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' help seeking ', ' help-seeking behavior ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Impulsivity ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Symptoms ', ' Population Research ', ' Research Training ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' stem ', ' service utilization ', ' ']",NIMH,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",F32,2015,57092,0.09150255744711425
"Cultural Adaptation of IMCP for Latino Patients with Advanced Cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos are at higher risk of poorer psychological and quality of life outcomes when compared to non-Hispanic white patients and other minority patients and commonly report using spiritual and religious strategies to cope with cancer. Maintaining hope, spiritual well-being and finding meaning in the cancer experience is critical for the adjustment and well-being of advanced cancer patients. However, there are no targeted psychosocial or psychotherapeutic interventions available for Latino patients diagnosed with advanced cancer. Individual Meaning-Centered psychotherapy (IMCP) is a novel psychotherapeutic intervention designed to help patients with advanced cancer sustain or enhance a sense of meaning, peace and purpose as they approach the end- of-life. Preliminary findings from the pilot randomized controlled trial demonstrate both the IMCP significantly reduce psychological distress and significantly increase spiritual well-being and a sense of meaning and purpose in life in predominantly non-Hispanic white advanced cancer patients. The long term goal of this study is to linguistically and culturally adapt IMCP for Spanish-speaking Latino cancer patients. The overall objective of this study is to use a mixed-method design to gain an understanding of the sources of meaning, hope, legacy and identity in advanced cancer and to explore the acceptability and feasibility of applying IMCP to Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer. The study findings will be used to adapt the intervention manual following the Ecological Validity Model and Cultural Adaptation Process Model. To achieve these aims, we will use a two-phased convergent mixed-method design. First, we will survey 70 Spanish-speaking advanced cancer patients and 50 mental health professionals who provide services to Latino cancer patients, to assess the acceptability and feasibility of the methods, concepts and goals of IMCP. Only patients who have completed the questionnaires will be approached for the in-depth interview to triangulate the information using a convergent integration approach. Fifteen Latino patients diagnosed with advanced cancer will be interviewed to learn patients' sources of meaning following a cancer diagnosis; explore their understanding of the concepts of the IMCP model; and to help discern the acceptability and feasibility of the goals, concepts, methods and metaphors of IMCP. This will be the first therapeutic intervention adapted for Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer. This application is responsive to the eighth priority of the NCI Strategic Plan, to study and identify factors contributing to disparities, develop culturally appropriate approaches, and disseminate interventions to overcome health disparities across the cancer control continuum from disease prevention to end-of-life care. This significant contribution will address the critical lack of palliative cancer care interventions for the Spanish- speaking population. The results of this formative study will provide guidance to this specific intervention's adaptation, but will also advance the field of cultural adaptation of psychosocial interventions with medical populations. OMB No. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12 Approved Through 8/31/2015) Page Continuation Format Page PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because ut addresses the critical lack of palliative cancer care interventions for the Spanish-speaking population. NCI recognizes that minorities and other underserved populations bear a far greater cancer burden than the general population. NCI aims to overcome cancer disparities by promoting research that aims to understand the underlying causes and contributing factors of treatment and survival disparities; and by accelerating the dissemination and implementation of interventions to address cancer health disparities. We expect that the findings of this mixed- method study will provide the foundation for the linguistic and cultural adaptation of Individual meaning Centered Psychotherapy. Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer are at risk of poor mental health outcomes. This will be the first therapeutic intervention adapted for Spanish-speaking Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer.

"Community-Based Prevention of Youth Violence in Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent violence is an important public health problem in the US, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Latinos are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group of children in the US, and are disproportionately affected by youth violence. There is, however, little information on the risk and protective factors that influence Latino youth violence. The overall objective of this proposed NICHD Career Development Award research is to identify risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration. This will be accomplished through three specific aims, which are to: 1) Identify beliefs, attitudes, and norms that influence violence perpetration among Latino adolescents; 2) Identify risk and protective factors in the family, peer, and community contexts that predict violence perpetration in a cohort of Latino youth; and 3) Validate and examine the relative contributions of individual, family, peer, and community factors to violence among Latino adolescents. In Aim 1, focus groups of violent and non-violent Latino adolescents will be conducted to examine risk and protective factors for violence, violence prevention strategies, and components of potentially effective violence prevention interventions. For Aim 2, a secondary data analysis of the National Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) will be conducted using multi-level modeling techniques to determine which contextual factors in adolescence are associated with violence perpetration approximately two years later. The findings from Aims 1 and 2 will be used in Aim 3 to design a survey that concurrently examines individual and contextual factors associated with youth violence, and to test the survey in a large sample of Latino adolescents. Findings from these three studies will provide the foundation for a future Latino youth violence prevention intervention that is culturally tailored, focuses on the major risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence, and is informed by Latino youth. This innovative approach uses multiple methods (qualitative, multi-level longitudinal quantitative, and a survey) to address a significant public health need for improving the knowledge base required to develop successful community-based interventions for Latino youth violence prevention. The proposed award is consistent with the component of the NICHD mission to ensure that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability. The exceptional resources and institutional support at UT Southwestern, outstanding multi-disciplinary mentorship team, and the proposed career development activities, will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and nationally recognized expert on community-based interventions effective in reducing and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence. There is an epidemic of youth violence in the US, with 36% of adolescents involved in fighting and 18% in weapon-carrying, and Latinos are disproportionately affected by violence; because youth violence can result in serious injury and homicide, there is an urgent need to identify strategies that can lead to successful violence prevention interventions for Latino youth. The proposed research identifies risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration using focus groups with Latino youth, multi-level modeling of a longitudinal dataset, and a newly-designed survey administered to Latino youth. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence, as the proposed research studies could lead to the development of an effective youth violence prevention intervention for Latinos.",Community-Based Prevention of Youth Violence in Latinos,8787135,K23HD068401,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Belief ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Financial cost ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' weapons ', ' tool ', ' fighting ', ' Techniques ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Community based prevention ', ' peer ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' cultural values ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' National Survey of Adolescents ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NICHD,LUNDQUIST INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION AT HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2015,126626,0.0253308250650047
"Health Inequalities: Social Isolation Among Rural Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The candidate for this K01 Award, a Latina nurse researcher, is requesting support for career development training and research, to become an independent investigator in mental health promotion among rural minorities. The overall career goal is to advance science at the nexus of culture, mental health, and rurality. The long-term goals of the training are to (1) build a mental health promotion research agenda among rural minority populations to enable rural communities to implement and sustain healthy socio-emotional environments and (2) serve as a role model and mentor for minority students and junior faculty. Specific short- term goals are to (1) develop and apply expertise in advanced research methods that are critical to an understanding of minority rural populations which can lead to the development of related health policy, (2) understand the role of social isolation in the cultural adaptation of rural Latino families in order to develop culturally relevant interventions, (3) develop expertise in the design and implementation of a repertoire of individual, family, and community public health interventions that reduce social isolation among rural Latinos, and (4) conduct independent investigator-initiated community-based research on mental health promotion among rural Latinos. Social isolation among rural Latino immigrants increases the risk of poor mental health outcomes and is significantly related to depression and anxiety among adults and suicidal ideation in children and adolescents. Longer time spent in the U.S. is associated with higher risk of mental health problems among Latinos, yet early promotion of mental health has not been targeted among this population. The specific aims of the proposed research are to (1) explore the effect of Latino immigrants' perceptions of their rural social environment and social isolation on their mental well-being through ethnographic interviews, (2) evaluate protective factors and modifiable risks to mental well-being associated with social isolation and the social environment among Latino immigrants living in a rural area, and (3) design a culturally appropriate family centered intervention to strengthen significant intrafamilia and intercommunity networks and promote positive mental well-being. This exploratory study is guided by community engagement research principles and employs mixed-methods to unravel the complexities of social isolation and develop an intervention to promote mental well-being among rural Latino immigrants. In-depth ethnographic interviews (N=60) and a quantitative community assessment survey (N=100) will be conducted with Latino women and men living in the rural ""new destinations"" of north Florida. Findings and engagement with an established community advisory board will culminate in the development of a family centered intervention to promote mental well-being. A mentoring team of distinguished national and international scientists has been assembled to achieve the training and research goals. The K01 Award will lead to an R21 proposal to pilot the family centered intervention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The K01 Award is an excellent fit with my overall career goal to advance science at the nexus of culture, mental health, and rurality. Immigrant Latinos living in rural areas of the U.S. are vastly underrepresented in mental health promotion.

"Developing a Community Empowered Intervention to Promote Latino Family Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the last two decades, Latino population growth has exceeded that of all other racial and ethnic groups in the U.S. This growth has been particularly striking in Oregon, the site of this study, and in 21 similar states with emerging immigrant communities. Rapid population growth, when combined with unprepared health and social service systems, can significantly contribute to Latino health disparities. Parenting practices have long been implicated as a key influence on family and child health. The proposed study involves collaboration between the University of Oregon's Center for Equity Promotion (CEQP) and Farmworker Housing Development Corporation (FHDC) and is designed in three phases: (1) collaboration advancement and community needs assessment (n = 95); (2) intervention development; and (3) intervention feasibility and initial efficacy trial {n= 120 families; 210 parents, 120 youth). The intervention would be delivered with Spanish-speaking Latino parents who live in FHDC housing developments and would focus on those malleable behaviors (e.g., parenting practices, stress management, healthy nutrition, and physical activity) that can promote Latino family health and youth well-being. The study's specific aims are: (1) to create a sustainable structure for ongoing, community-empowered research by building on our existing collaborative community partnership; (2) to identify key family-based health behaviors that confer risk for and protection against negative physical and behavioral health outcomes (e.g., overweight and obesity, respiratory illness, substance use, depression, and youth problem behaviors) among FHDC families, through a collaboratively designed and implemented mixed methods needs assessment; (3) to develop, refine, and manual-ize an intervention that adapts promising practices from community and evidence-based interventions shown to impact behavioral and physical health outcomes for immigrant Latino families, and emphasizes family resilience, strong parenting practices, and family health-promoting behaviors; and (4) to examine the feasibility and initial efficacy of the intervention in terms of promoting healthy famiy behaviors that reduce risk for negative physical and behavioral health outcomes. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This community-based participatory research study aims to identify priority areas and malleable factors that, if positively influenced through an interventio targeting family health, could have broad ripple effects for reducing disease, including chronic conditions, among Latinos.",Developing a Community Empowered Intervention to Promote Latino Family Health,8811341,R24MD008039,"['Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heart ', ' Housing ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Manuals ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Oregon ', ' Parents ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Population Growth ', ' pressure ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Disease Progression ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' respiratory ', ' interest ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' empowered ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Community Practice ', ' Social Health Services ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' youth drug use ', ' adolescent drug use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' demographics ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' efficacy testing ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Buffers ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Community Developments ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF OREGON,R24,2015,295017,0.1304772645380633
"Using Brief Interventions to Reduce Unhealthy Drinking Among Latino Day Laborers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research fulfills the NIAAA's mission to address health disparities by reducing unhealthy drinking among a high-risk and underserved population of Latino immigrant men. Latinos are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the country and immigration to the United States (US) has increased dramatically over the last ten years. Latino men are more likely to engage in unhealthy drinking than men in other racial/ethnic groups and their alcohol use increases with time spent in the United States. Despite these disparities, Latino immigrant men are unlikely to receive evidenced-based screening and brief intervention for unhealthy drinking due to their limited access to health care. We have culturally adapted a brief intervention for this population in order to broaden its reach and increase its efficacy. This stud will test the feasibility and efficacy of offering a culturally adapted intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking among Latino day laborers, who are particularly vulnerable to unhealthy drinking given their economic and social context. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the feasibility of offering screening and brief intervention to Latino day laborers delivered by community health workers (Promotores) at a day labor worker center; and 2) test the initial efficacy of the intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking using a randomized control group study design. Feasibility will be assessed through qualitative and quantitative assessments of recruitment, retention, reach, intervention fidelity, and participant satisfaction. We will assess changes in unhealthy drinking from baseline to eight weeks in both the intervention and the control group. We hypothesize that levels of unhealthy drinking will be lower in men in the intervention than the control group. The study uses several innovative approaches to address a significant health disparity in a high-risk and underserved population, including offering the intervention at a day labor worker center, using community health workers to deliver the brief intervention, and adapting the brief intervention to be more culturally relevat, and using tablets for data collection and providing personalized feedback. Findings will help determine the best methods for optimizing recruitment, data collection and intervention fidelity in a hard to reach population. If effective, screening and brief interventions could be implemented by community health workers in day labor worker centers nationwide, as well as a variety of other community settings. Given that Latinos are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the country, reducing unhealthy drinking in this population could have a significant public health impact by lowering rates of morbidity due to alcohol abuse and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer and unintentional injury. Furthermore, this novel intervention approach may also be generalizable to other health issues prevalent in the Latino immigrant community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test the feasibility and efficacy of screening and brief intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking among Latino immigrant men in a community setting. Reducing unhealthy drinking in the growing population of Latino immigrant men could have a significant public health impact by lowering rates of morbidity due to alcohol abuse and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer and unintentional injury.",Using Brief Interventions to Reduce Unhealthy Drinking Among Latino Day Laborers,9116390,R34AA022696,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Immigrations ', ' In-Migration ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Language ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social isolation ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Unintentional Injury ', ' Accidental Injury ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' satisfaction ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' drinking ', ' social ', ' brief treatment ', ' brief therapy ', ' brief intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Community Health ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' drinking behavior ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' screening and brief intervention ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIAAA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R34,2015,62373,0.0674065814236708
"NIMHD RESEARCH CENTER ON LATINO IMMIGRANT/REFUGEE HEALTH DISPARITIES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The changing demographics of the U.S. population ~ in which recent immigrants are playing a key role in population growth ~ have and will continue to exert a major influence on the course of health disparities. Therefore, the very timely overall mission of the proposed GWU NIMHD P20 Exploratory Center is to build on an existing academic-community collaboration with the Latino immigrant population in the Washington, DC metropolitan area in order to better understand factors contributing to racial/ethnic minority health disparities specific to this critical population, to increase both community and academic capacity to address these factors, and to test a multi-level community intervention addressing the health disparity issue of substance abuse and co-occurring conditions. This collaboration will: 1) Contribute to the transdisciplinary advancement of the field with respect to eliminating health disparities as well as the health of the Latino community; 2) Develop, implement and evaluate an innovative, community-driven, multi-component community intervention (called ADELANTE) that addresses a vulnerability cluster of substance abuse and co-occurring conditions in youth and families ; 3) Provide an ongoing mechanism for training and educating faculty, students and community members in a range of issues related to addressing racial/ethnic health disparities generally and in Latino immigrant/refugee populations; and provide opportunities for partner community members to gain specific research skills that will increase capacity and research participation; and 4) Support the overall mission of the Center by conducting specific, collaborative activities aimed at: increasing skills and knowledge related to preventing substance abuse and related health conditions, testing innovative social media and branding strategies to increase the likelihood of behavior change, and improving health literacy and capacity using a tested community training approach. 5) Disseminate the results of the research to the participating communities and to the field, via the Center website and multiple channels.             The proposed Center is highly relevant because of its demographic focus, its foundation In an existing university-community partnership, and the clear need to develop collaborative intervention and research approaches to address health disparities in this significant population group.",NIMHD RESEARCH CENTER ON LATINO IMMIGRANT/REFUGEE HEALTH DISPARITIES,8806428,P20MD006898,"['Communities ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Addressing acquiescence: Reducing survey error to promote Latino health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous advances have improved our ability to collect valid and reliable data on health behaviors and outcomes. However, health behaviors are often influenced by psychosocial variables - such as attitudes and beliefs - that are unobservable and, thus, more difficult to measure. Attitudes and beliefs are typically measured using Likert-scaled items, in which respondents rate their agreement with statements along a continuum. Since the 1920s, researchers have observed that some respondents tend to systematically agree to Likert-scaled questionnaire items, regardless of question content. This pattern of responding to survey questions is known as acquiescent response style (ARS). ARS jeopardizes efforts to reduce health disparities. ARS can weaken health experts' understanding of what factors influence health behaviors, their ability to create effective interventions, and th accuracy with which they evaluate programs to reduce health disparities. Research indicates that ARS use may be influenced by culture, and, in the U.S., may be of particular concern when surveying Latino populations. Research by the investigators and others suggests that 22-24 percent of Latino survey respondents acquiesce on health surveys, as compared to 13 percent of non-Latino Whites. These culturally patterned differences in ARS may introduce error in health survey data, which, in turn, may artificially create or enhance distinctions both within Latino populations and between Latinos and non-Latino Whites, thereby erroneously informing health disparities research. The Latino population is demographically and culturally diverse, and almost nothing is known about what factors may drive ARS use among Latinos from different ethnic or cultural groups. Further, despite a growing need to obtain valid health data from Latinos, who comprise 16 percent of the U.S. population and are expected to increase to 29 percent by 2050, it is unclear how to address ARS. The proposed study will: (1) identify predictors of ARS; and (2) screen for the most promising methods of reducing ARS during data collection and adjusting for ARS after data collection is complete. This research focuses on Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans, as these groups comprise the three largest Latino sub-groups. Data from this study will be derived from two surveys. The first survey will gather data from 2900 Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, and non-Latino Whites in order to identify factors associated with ARS. The second survey will compare different methods of addressing ARS among 1161 Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Cuban American health survey respondents. Findings from this research will provide researchers with empirically driven guidance on when to anticipate and how to reduce ARS-associated measurement error when surveying Latino respondents. Such knowledge will improve health data validity through increased ARS awareness and standardization of methods to address ARS, thereby contributing to more accurate understanding of the psychosocial determinants of Latino health, more effective health promotion programs targeting Latinos, and better long-term Latino health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will enhance our ability to address an important source of health survey measurement error, which, when unaddressed, may weaken our understanding of moderators and mediators of health behaviors, our ability to create effective interventions, and the accuracy of our efforts to evaluate programs to redress Latino health disparities. Findings from this research will empower health researchers to make empirically guided decisions about the collection and treatment of survey data as they promote the health of the U.S.'s growing, culturally diverse Latino population.",Addressing acquiescence: Reducing survey error to promote Latino health,8847305,R01CA172283,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cuban American ', ' Data Collection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Surveys ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Play ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' psychosocial ', ' empowered ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' trait ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' stem ', ' effective intervention ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2015,594622,0.19886768627056653
"Randomized Trial of Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of PTSD among Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to provide effective treatment to Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD is critical given the high prevalence of PTSD among Latinos in comparison to other racial/ethnic groups and the projections for dramatic demographic growth of the Latino population. The committee convened by the Institute of Medicine to assess the evidence on the efficacy of treatments for PTSD reported strong evidence supporting the efficacy of exposure therapies for the treatment of PTSD. The committee further noted that although psychotherapies may present special challenges in different ethnic/cultural groups, ""the evidence is mostly silent on the acceptability, efficacy, or generalizability of treatment in ethnic and cultural minorities."" Eliminating health disparities for diverse cultural groups is a public health priority.One of the nation's health objectives presented in Healthy People 2010, called for eliminating disparities in mental health and mental health care for all racial/ethnic groups. Nevertheless, an evaluation conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2010 revealed that Latinos received less mental health care than other racial/ethnic groups. The report acknowledges that limited English proficiency could be a contributing factor for the gap in mental health care for Latinos. The significant impairment and the high societal costs associated with PTSD underscore the urgency of the need to make the benefits of clinical advances in the treatment of PTSD available to Latinos with limited English proficiency. The proposed study directly addresses this mental health care disparity by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy with Spanish- speaking Latinos. In preliminary work, we translated and culturally adapted the PE therapy manual, maintaining fidelity to the original treatment, and conducted a pilot study that evidenced the feasibility and acceptability of PE for Spanish-speaking Latinos. As our next step, we propose to conduct a RCT with Spanish-speaking Latinos to determine whether PE is superior to applied relaxation in improving primary (PTSD symptoms) and secondary (functioning, health-related quality of life, and depression) outcomes. We will recruit 100 Latinos with PTSD, 18-65 years old, in primary care clinics. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, week 20, and week 28. This study has the potential to contribute to improvements in the overall well- being and quality of life of Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD and, by extension, likely their families as well. Misconceptions about exposure therapy can contribute to limit its adoption in clinical practices serving Latinos. If positive results are evidenced for unacculturated Latinos in Puerto Rico, characterized by dominant Latino orientation, this study would establish an evidence base for expanded research that has the potential to shift current clinical practice in mental health settings serving Latino clients by facilitating adoption of a linguistically and culturally relevan PE manual-based treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is of considerable public health significance as it will provide foundational information on the clinical use of a linguistically an culturally relevant prolonged exposure therapy for the treatment of Spanish-speaking Latinos with posttraumatic stress disorder. This study has the potential to contribute to improvements in the well-being and quality of life of Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD and to reduce misperceptions of exposure therapy that can contribute to limit its adoption in clinical practices serving Latinos.",Randomized Trial of Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of PTSD among Latinos,8889303,SC1MH090599,"['Accidents ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' assault ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Client ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Rape ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Societies ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Terrorism ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' Individual ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Clinic ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Group Affiliation ', ' High Prevalence ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Minority ', ' attack (violent) ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' combat ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' clinical practice ', ' public health priorities ', ' randomized trial ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,SC1,2015,371030,0.1705531561562944
"Promoting post-treatment self-management among Latinos with cancer DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spanish-speaking Latinos with cancer experience disparities related to the need for information, communication with clinicians, quality of care, an increased risk of the sequelae of cancer and its treatment. Patient activation interventions, such as those that promote survivorship care planning (SCP) are critical to increase their self-efficacy and resources for addressing these disparities. The overall goal of this study is to enable Spanish-speaking cancer survivors to be active participants in their care once the acute cancer treatment phase has ended. The aims of this project are to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of providing survivorship care planning and education through an interactive mobile phone application (mSCP) for Spanish-speaking men and women with breast or colorectal cancer as they approach the end of active treatment in public hospital settings. Mobile phones are an excellent delivery mode among Latinos due to their widespread use of web-enabled phones to access the internet. We will develop a low- literacy Spanish-language mobile phone application (mSCP) that helps cancer survivors understand their diagnosis and treatment, implement and track physical activity and stress management practices, recognize symptoms of recurrence or late effects of treatment, and communicate these symptoms to their health care providers. Through a pilot 3-month randomized controlled trial (RCT) among 50 Spanish-speaking Latinos with non-metastatic breast or colorectal cancer, we will compare the effects of the 3-month interactive mSCP intervention versus usual care on self-reported outcomes at 3 months including cancer coping self-efficacy, cancer-specific distress, fatigue, and walking. We also will assess knowledge of needed follow-up visits and surveillance exams. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and study procedures, we will collect process evaluation data on: costs to produce a treatment summary; protocol adherence; adverse events; use of the mSCP; and key informants' (10 intervention group participants and 4 oncology providers) perceptions of the intervention, study procedures, and outcomes (e.g., perceived benefits, ease of use, burden). The mSCP will utilize daily diary and cumulative bar graphs for self-monitoring, immediate positive feedback on diary entries, daily stress management and exercise messages, and low-literacy modules with step-by-step guides to using the cancer coping skills. Results of this 2-year study will prepare us to conduct a large-scale RCT. Having SCP information in a user-friendly mobile phone application is a promising approach to promote high quality survivorship care. These types of interventions may be acceptable and economical ways of meeting the informational and self-care needs of Latino cancer survivors and help reduce disparities in health and cancer care. If proven effective in a subsequent study, this user-friendly, secure mobile phone tool could help Spanish-speaking cancer survivors, and potentially other vulnerable populations, meet evidence- based recommendations for health care and self-management after acute cancer treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed project promotes public health goals because it addresses cancer health disparities experienced by vulnerable low-income Spanish-speaking men and women, who lack access to culturally and linguistically appropriate follow-up care once they complete acute cancer treatment. Because it uses a mode of delivery (mobile phones) that is popular among ethnically diverse low-SES populations and has great dissemination potential, this study is an important first step that could lead to widespread access to cancer survivorship support via a free application that can be disseminated to supplement clinical care.",Promoting post-treatment self-management among Latinos with cancer,8889230,R21CA182536,"['post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Aftercare ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' literacy ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Solutions ', ' survivorship ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Walking ', ' falls ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Distress ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' empowerment ', ' Graph ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' education planning ', ' cancer care ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Provider ', ' diabetes risk ', ' data processing ', ' computerized data processing ', ' Population Group ', ' Low income ', ' Adverse Late Effects ', ' Late Effects ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Intervention ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' informant ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' active method ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' treatment effect ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' web-enabled ', ' user-friendly ', ' mobile device ', ' handheld mobile device ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R21,2015,172369,0.03282234260622317
"Reducing HIV Disparities among Latinos: Disseminating An Effective Intervention     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a 3-year study (R24) to facilitate dissemination, uptake, and sustainability of the HoMBReS: Por UN Cambio intervention, a lay health advisor (LHA) intervention found to be efficacious in reducing the HIV risk among immigrant Latino men in the Southeast. Informed by the lived experiences of immigrant Latino men, perspectives of organizational representatives, and social cognitive and empowerment theories, this intervention was developed and tested by a long-term community-university partnership that has used and will continue to use community-based participatory research (CBPR) principles throughout all phases of the research process. In the proposed study, 3 community-based organizations (CBOs) that represent typical community-level providers of HIV and STD prevention interventions (i.e., an AIDS service organization, a Latino-serving organization, and a county public health department) will work with our existing CBPR partnership to develop a comprehensive toolkit to guide implementation; implement and evaluate implementation; and disseminate results and materials through multiple channels. Each CBO will hire 1 part-time project coordinator to recruit, train, and support 8 lay health advisors (known as ""Navigates""). These 24 Navigates will promote sexual health among members of their soccer team-based social networks for 12 months. Baseline and follow-up data will be collected from social network members to evaluate impact. Blending both quantitative and qualitative methods, we will explore facilitators and barriers to intervention implementation, fidelity, and potential sustainability by these diverse CBOs. Pre and post-implementation, we will conduct individual in-depth interviews with CBO representatives. Post-implementation, we also will conduct focus groups with Navigates at each CBO. We will use scale-up and spread, a framework informed by diffusion and social normative theories, to guide this study. We also will evaluate the CBPR process, using in-depth interviews with partners, direct observation of partnership meetings and study implementation, and partnership document review.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will provide insights to the increasing number of CBOs in the South seeking to reduce HIV/STD-related health disparities among the growing population of immigrant Latinos; and aligns with the Affordable Care Act's emphasis on recruiting and training community health workers to connect marginalized populations with preventive health services.                ",Reducing HIV Disparities among Latinos: Disseminating An Effective Intervention,8820809,R24MD002774,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diffusion ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Life Experience ', ' male ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Newsletter ', ' North Carolina ', ' Preventive Health Services ', ' health care professional practice ', ' Professional Practice ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Soccer ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Social Network ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' uptake ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Immigrant ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' condoms ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' HIV risk ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' HIV/STD ', ' ']",NIMHD,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R24,2015,470188,0.07113008118947985
"Association of Acculturation with Type 2 Diabetes Risk Among US Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its long term sequelae are increasing in the US, particularly among Latinos. Latinos are at increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and develop T2D at younger ages and at a lower body weight index compared to non-Hispanic whites. For these reasons, Latinos have been identified as a NIDDK priority population with a NIDDK research agenda that includes both biologic, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors that affect T2D prevalence and complications. Acculturation is an important socio-cultural factor that may explain the disproportionate health burden of T2D among Latinos. Acculturation is defined as the process whereby an immigrant culture adopts the beliefs and practices of a host culture. There are limited studies of T2D risk factors and acculturation and how this relationship affects intermediary T2D processes and outcomes such as incident T2D and subclinical cardiovascular disease. The association between acculturation and T2D is inconsistent among Latinos in the published literature. This grant will study the association of acculturation with T2D risk and risk factors using data from multiple well- established epidemiologic NIH cohort studies using validated multidimensional acculturation scales that capture the complex domains of cultural values, beliefs, and behaviors of the acculturation process. The 5 cohorts are: San Antonio Heart Study, Sacramento Latino Study of Aging, Boston Area Community Health Survey, Dallas Heart Study and the Framingham Heart Study Omni Cohort. The simultaneous comparison of findings will maximize the potential for exploring whether the reported heterogeneity of prior study findings is due to differences in underlying Latino cohort characteristics, geographic differences in the process of acculturation in the US and/or differences in the measure of acculturation. Dr. Lopez's long-term goal is to become an independent patient-oriented researcher in diabetes care. Aided by advanced coursework in biostatistics and social epidemiology during the K23 award period, Dr. Lopez will acquire additional research skills and experience under the mentorship of nationally and internationally known researchers in a supportive academic environment. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acculturation is an important socio-cultural factor that may explain the disproportionate health burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among Latinos. Understanding how acculturation impacts T2D risk factors and outcomes among Latinos will inform how best to tailor lifestyle and behavioral interventions and reduce health disparities. 2",Association of Acculturation with Type 2 Diabetes Risk Among US Latinos,8905602,K23DK098280,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Body Weight ', ' Boston ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Literature ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Physiology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' Immigrant ', ' apM1 (adipose-specific) protein ', ' apM-1 protein ', ' adipocyte, C1q and collagen domain containing protein ', ' adipocyte complement-related protein 30-kDa ', ' ACRP30 protein ', ' adiponectin ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Visceral ', ' subcutaneous ', ' waist circumference ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' diabetes risk ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' adipokines ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' obesity risk ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' fasting glucose ', ' ']",NIDDK,MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL,K23,2015,30578,0.1251277926056329

"Misdiagnosis of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bilingual children are often misdiagnosed as having a speech disorder when they truly exhibit normal development. In addition, speech-language pathologists (SLP) are avoiding the assessment of bilingual children due to the lack of knowledge and resources necessary for best practice with this population. Misdiagnosis of speech sound disorders in this population has long-term emotional, financial, and educational costs. Misdiagnosis of speech disorders in bilingual children can be prevented if we acquire more information on what constitutes normal and disordered speech development in the bilingual population. A theoretical model that allows us to differentiate difference in speech production (i.e., a difference in how a bilingual child speaks due to the influence of one language on the other) from speech disorder (i.e., an underlying speech-learning disability) will provide SLPs with the knowledge they need to prevent misdiagnosis. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to (1) to develop a theoretical model that accounts for how between-language interaction facilitates or inhibits speech sound production in bilinguals by measuring how, and to what extent, the two languages of bilinguals interact and (2) develop evidence based diagnostic criteria for clinicians to differentiate typically- developing bilingual children rom bilingual children with speech sound disorders. Bilingual children with typical and disordered development will be compared to their English-speaking peers on measures of speech sound ability. Children will produce sounds in single words and their productions will be phonetically transcribed. Child productions will be examined, in both English and Spanish and across both languages, on common diagnostic measures used for monolingual children. Mixed effects regression models will be used to identify between- language interaction in bilingual speech and the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) will be used to determine sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic measures examined. Findings will lead to a characterization of typical and disordered speech sound development in bilingual children and diagnostic guidelines for speech-language pathologists to use in the differential diagnosis of speech difference from speech disorder. These findings will reduce diagnostic error in the identification of speech sound disorders in this population, reducing health disparities for Latino children.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos are the most populous minority group in the United States and children are the largest segment of the Latino population, comprising the majority of all children in some states (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010b, 2010c). This research will address a large and growing need: Reducing health disparities between Latinos and other racial and ethnic groups. The outcomes of this study will serve to impact (1) the lives of Latino children and their families by limiting the number of children misdiagnosed with speech sound disorders in the United States and (2) speech- language pathologists who are struggling to assess and diagnose the growing number of bilingual children on their caseloads.             ",Misdiagnosis of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Children,8890578,R21HD081382,"['Accounting ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Speech-Language Pathology ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Attorneys ', ' Lawyers ', ' Guidelines ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' bilingualism ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Speech Development ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Address ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2015,225885,0.034405709751958
"Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors in Puerto Rican Youth Growing Up DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use/abuse (SU/SUD) and other HIV/STI risk behaviors are major public health challenges not equally distributed across racial/ethnic groups. The fastest growing minority population in the US, Latino  youth, have elevated rates HIV/STI risk behaviors and SU/SUD, particularly among those abandoning  traditional Latino values and shifting towards American values (acculturation). This application, in response to  PA-09-236: HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations in the US (R01), aims to identify factors related  to the development of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection among Latino youth during a critical  transitional developmental period: emerging adulthood. Existing studies have revealed important disparities, however, they are limited in their ability to identify processes relevant for Latino youth, as they have not included sufficient numbers of Latino youth from fairly homogeneous subgroups (e.g.  Puerto Ricans, Mexican- Americans, etc.) and lack information about acculturation, a key determinant of risk among Latino youth. We propose to conduct the fourth wave on the Boricua Youth Study (BYS~ R01 MH56401) focused on HIV/STI risk, infection in emerging adulthood (BYS Wave 4, N=1,992, youth ages 16 - 24). The BYS has already generated 3 waves of data (years 2001 to 2004) on children of Puerto Rican background (ages 5 -13 at Wave 1), with study findings described in 19 peer-reviewed publications to date. Besides the comprehensive longitudinal assessment strategy, a unique feature of the BYS is its two-site design, as it included children living in the South Bronx (SBx), NYC and San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR). At BYS Wave 4, we propose to conduct intensive assessment of HIV/STI risk (including testing for HIV and STIs) and enhance the assessment of SU/SUD, in addition to continuing tracking of cultural experiences, and psychiatric disorders and other factors. The proposed study has as its specific aims, to examine: (I) Prevalence of HIV/STI risk behaviors and rates of HIV/STI infection in emerging adulthood and the influence of sexual orientation, teenage unintended pregnancy and early sexual debut. (II) How development of SU/SUD (nicotine, alcohol, illicit/prescription drugs) starting in childhood/earlyadolescence may influence HIV/STI risk in emerging adulthood in the context of a  Ecodevelopmental framework. (III) The role of acculturation (cultural practices, identification, values) in relation to SU/SUD and its relationship to HIV/STI risk behaviors/infection.   Once Wave 4 is completed, the BYS will represent an unparalleled source of prospective information  about onset of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection  as well as persistence and progression of SU  from childhood to emerging adulthood in a homogeneous Latino subgroup examined in two contexts (SBx and  PR).This information will fill a gap in knowledge, and the model resulting from our investigation will enable and  facilitate the integration of specific factrs of relevance for Latino youth (e.g., acculturation) as part of  interventions for this high-risk group. A population-based longitudinal study is the best strategy to understand specific mechanisms involved in processes determining HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in relation to substance use and abuse among high-risk youth who are part of the fastest growing US minority group194 and whose risk experience have not been properly addressed to date (given for example, the superficial assessment as issues such as acculturation). By adding a 4th wave of data to the Boricua Youth Study (which started about 10 years ago), we can, in 5 years (rather than in 15, if a cohort like that had to established today a a very high cost), close a key gap in knowledge and generate information about risk and protective factors as well as mechanisms  operating in the determination HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in the lives of a high-risk Latino group  (Puerto Ricans), directly informing highly needed intervention advancement, contributing to revert important  health disparities.",Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors

"A Longitudinal Study of Noncognitive Skills among Latino Immigrants Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed study will examine the development of non-cognitive skills during elementary school among children of Latin American immigrants. Non-cognitive skills, which encompass a variety of emotional, behavioral, and personality traits, are related to key indicators of child and adult well-being. Thus, understanding group differences in non-cognitive skills may shed light on educational and health disparities. Children of Latin American immigrants now comprise nearly 14% of American children under 18. The health and educational prospects of these children are thus of substantial public policy concern. Previous research has shown that Latino children of immigrants differ from native children at school entry in terms of both cognitive skills and non-cognitive skills, but the role of non-cognitive skills in their educational outcomes has yet to be systematically examined. Such skills may be an important determinant of incorporation trajectories of Latino and other contemporary immigrant groups. This research will fill several significant gaps in the current knowledge. First, although the growth rate of non-cognitive skills varies during childhood, the most previous research examining inter-group differences in non-cognitive skills has focused on comparisons at a single time point. The proposed research will take a longitudinal approach to measuring non-cognitive skill development from grades K-8. Second, little is known about the predictors of non-cognitive skills among Latino immigrants' children and how they compare to those of natives' children. While we know that Latino immigrant families differ from the native population in certain critical factors, such as the use of early childcare and parental education-related practices, such differences have yet to be studied in relation to the development of non-cognitive skills. Third, the contributions of non-cognitive skills to differences in academic achievement between Latino immigrants' and natives' children have yet to be studied. This project will analyze data from the ECLS-K to address 3 specific aims: (1) To describe differences in non-cognitive skills between Latino children of immigrants and three native comparison groups, at different points in time during the elementary school years; (2) To identify correlates of non-cognitive skill development for children of Latino immigrants and compare their predictive power with native comparison groups; and (3) To examine the contribution of non-cognitive skills to gaps in educational achievement between Latino immigrant students and native comparison groups. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The health and educational prospects of Latino immigrants' children are of substantial public policy concern due to the large size and low average socioeconomic status of this group. Non-cognitive skills are related to health outcomes because they directly impact health behaviors and because they affect educational attainment, a key predictor of health disparities. Understanding the unique trajectories and determinants of non-cognitive skills among Latino immigrants' children will help policymakers promote greater health and educational achievement for this group.",A Longitudinal Study of Noncognitive Skills among Latino Immigrants Children,8917291,R03HD080789,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Family ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Language ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Motivation ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Public Policy ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' improved ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Personality Traits ', ' Fostering ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' American ', ' elementary school ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' 8th grade ', ' eighth grade ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Emotional ', ' kindergarten ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' comparison group ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R03,2015,72881,0.11288703184891384
"Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors in Puerto Rican Youth Growing Up DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use/abuse (SU/SUD) and other HIV/STI risk behaviors are major public health challenges not equally distributed across racial/ethnic groups. The fastest growing minority population in the US, Latino  youth, have elevated rates HIV/STI risk behaviors and SU/SUD, particularly among those abandoning  traditional Latino values and shifting towards American values (acculturation). This application, in response to  PA-09-236: HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations in the US (R01), aims to identify factors related  to the development of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection among Latino youth during a critical  transitional developmental period: emerging adulthood. Existing studies have revealed important disparities, however, they are limited in their ability to identify processes relevant for Latino youth, as they have not included sufficient numbers of Latino youth from fairly homogeneous subgroups (e.g.  Puerto Ricans, Mexican- Americans, etc.) and lack information about acculturation, a key determinant of risk among Latino youth. We propose to conduct the fourth wave on the Boricua Youth Study (BYS~ R01 MH56401) focused on HIV/STI risk, infection in emerging adulthood (BYS Wave 4, N=1,992, youth ages 16 - 24). The BYS has already generated 3 waves of data (years 2001 to 2004) on children of Puerto Rican background (ages 5 -13 at Wave 1), with study findings described in 19 peer-reviewed publications to date. Besides the comprehensive longitudinal assessment strategy, a unique feature of the BYS is its two-site design, as it included children living in the South Bronx (SBx), NYC and San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR). At BYS Wave 4, we propose to conduct intensive assessment of HIV/STI risk (including testing for HIV and STIs) and enhance the assessment of SU/SUD, in addition to continuing tracking of cultural experiences, and psychiatric disorders and other factors. The proposed study has as its specific aims, to examine: (I) Prevalence of HIV/STI risk behaviors and rates of HIV/STI infection in emerging adulthood and the influence of sexual orientation, teenage unintended pregnancy and early sexual debut. (II) How development of SU/SUD (nicotine, alcohol, illicit/prescription drugs) starting in childhood/earlyadolescence may influence HIV/STI risk in emerging adulthood in the context of a  Ecodevelopmental framework. (III) The role of acculturation (cultural practices, identification, values) in relation to SU/SUD and its relationship to HIV/STI risk behaviors/infection.   Once Wave 4 is completed, the BYS will represent an unparalleled source of prospective information  about onset of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection  as well as persistence and progression of SU  from childhood to emerging adulthood in a homogeneous Latino subgroup examined in two contexts (SBx and  PR).This information will fill a gap in knowledge, and the model resulting from our investigation will enable and  facilitate the integration of specific factrs of relevance for Latino youth (e.g., acculturation) as part of  interventions for this high-risk group. A population-based longitudinal study is the best strategy to understand specific mechanisms involved in processes determining HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in relation to substance use and abuse among high-risk youth who are part of the fastest growing US minority group194 and whose risk experience have not been properly addressed to date (given for example, the superficial assessment as issues such as acculturation). By adding a 4th wave of data to the Boricua Youth Study (which started about 10 years ago), we can, in 5 years (rather than in 15, if a cohort like that had to established today a a very high cost), close a key gap in knowledge and generate information about risk and protective factors as well as mechanisms  operating in the determination HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in the lives of a high-risk Latino group  (Puerto Ricans), directly informing highly needed intervention advancement, contributing to revert important  health disparities.",Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors

"Optimizing Educational Video Designs to Improve Minority Organ Donor Registration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. organ donation system remains in a perpetual state of crisis. Over 115,000 patients in the U.S. are waiting for organ transplants, and the waitlist increases by several thousand annually despite over 10,000 dying or becoming too sick to receive a transplant. Latinos are disproportionally affected by this organ crisis due to their higher prevalence of diabetes and end-stage renal disease from inadequate access to treatment. Of the 115,000 waiting, over 95,000 require kidneys, and of these, 19.2 percent are Latino despite Latinos comprising only 16.7 percent of the U.S. population. Latinos also comprise 15.8 percent of recipients but only 13.1 percent of donors. These rates remain well below the disproportionate need since organs best match when donors and recipients are of similar race. We will investigate means for improving organ donor registration among Latinos using educational videos about uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCDD) produced and distributed in partnership with our network of Latino owned barbershops and beauty parlors. uDCDD programs consider candidates for donation no matter timing or location of death, so long as consideration occurs after all life sustaining efforts are exhausted. Video content will include live footage from uDCDD programs in Spain, which has markedly improved rates of kidney transplantation compared to the U.S. If successful, we estimate that uDCDD programs could provide 22,000 more donation opportunities annually in the U.S. Educational models will inform the design of our uDCDD videos to test how genre (expert testimonials, documentary with live uDCDD footage) and ending choices (uplifting, negative consequences, unresolved) impact immediate registration after viewing. Our application is a 3-phase qualitative and quantitative research design that includes an intervention development phase using qualitative interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos (Aim 1); a 2x3 randomized controlled trial, in which we will randomize customers to receive one of six videos delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered through registration online or with a mail application (Aim 2); and a failure analysis whereby we will interview some of the participants from the randomized trial who failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain their reasons (Aim 3). This research will provide a model for future studies, in which we will modify our videos based on our research findings and distribute them in Latino-owned barbershops and beauty parlors using large screen TVs or interactive kiosks. Through this work, we hope to reduce organ transplantation disparities through increased registration among Latinos who comprise a group having a disproportionally greater need for kidney transplants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will use educational videos to inspire increased organ donor registration among Dominicans and Puerto Ricans who visit Latino owned barbershops and beauty parlors, a community setting where we have previously shown with our cardiovascular health promotion and cancer prevention research constitutes a unique peer network that can be utilized to promote healthy behavior for customers. Videos will present how uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD) programs that consider candidates for donation no matter timing or location of death, so long as consideration occurs after all life sustaining efforts are exhausted, are promising means for solving the organ donation crisis for Latinos, a population with disproportionally greater need. This research meets specific goals of Healthy People 2020 including, ""Decreasing disparities and measuring access to care for diverse populations, including racial and ethnic minorities and older adults"" and its agenda advocating use of targeted and tailored interventions for improving health among disadvantaged communities.",Optimizing Educational Video Designs to Improve Minority Organ Donor Registration,8831651,R01DK098610,"['Academy ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Award ', ' Beauty ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' Imagination ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Organ Donor ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Spain ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Visitors to Patients ', ' Work ', ' Determination of Death ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Instructional Models ', ' Educational Models ', ' base ', ' exhaust ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' single-blind trial ', ' Single-Blind Study ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Organ Donations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dominican ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' community setting ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' hypertension control ', ' randomized trial ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIDDK,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2015,378285,0.0024663620210445656
"Reducing Cancer Disparaties Among Latinos in Texas DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Texas regional Community Networks Program, Latinos Contra El Cancer, combines innovative research, extensive community outreach, and a multi-faceted training program, all conducted within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) context, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in Latinos, and to build a cadre of competitive health disparities researchers trained in CBPR in three regions of Texas (Houston, El Paso, the Lower Rio Grande Valley). This will be accomplished through the work of three distinct yet complementary cores (Outreach, Research, and Training) to integrate knowledge generation, community health education, and community and researcher capacity building within and across the three sites, building on existing research infrastructures, longstanding relationships, and novel communication systems. The overarching goals of each Core are described below.  The goal of the proposed Outreach Program is to increase the use of evidence-based biomedical and behavioral procedures and interventions to reduce the cancer burden among Latinos in Texas. We will build on existing community partnerships, infrastructure, and programs to develop an Outreach Program that will accomplish this goal through capacity building with community partners and direct health promotion in Latino communities.  The goal of the Research Core - Intervention Study is to develop and evaluate an innovative intervention approach for reducing cancer risk related to the three leading behavioral risk factors for cancer: smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity. The project will focus on participants in a longitudinal study of cancer risk factors among Mexican Americans in Houston (Mexican American Cohort Study).  The goal of the Research Core - Pilot Study is to utilize quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the socio-demographic, acculturation, and psychosocial factors that influence Mexican Americans willingness to provide biologic specimens for biobanking.  The goal of the mentored Training Program is to prepare a cadre of new and early stage investigators to conduct cancer disparities research in Latino communities, with a particular emphasis on building skills and capacity to conduct community-based participatory research. Latinos Contra El Cancer combines innovative research, extensive community outreach, and a multi-faceted training program, all conducted within a community-based participatory research (CBPR) context, to reduce cancer-related health disparities in Latinos, and to build a cadre of competitive health disparities researchers trained in CBPR in three regions of Texas (Houston, El Paso, the Lower Rio Grande Valley).",Reducing Cancer Disparaties Among Latinos in Texas,9114197,U54CA153505,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Goals ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Latino ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Community Networks ', ' Staging ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' cancer risk ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' outreach program ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Behavioral ', ' willingness ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community based participatory research ', ' evidence base ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U54,2015,391398,0.04296226760927538
"Tu Salud Si Cuenta!  Reaching Latino family dyads to increase physical activity and healthy eating ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Most adults in the U.S. fail to meet national physical activity (PA) and dietary recommendations, and Latinos are less likely to meet these recommendations than non-Latino Whites. Physical inactivity, a poor diet, and obesity are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and stroke and are important contributors to preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Social environments are widely recognized to have an important impact on these behaviors, yet most behavior change programs give limited attention to the social contexts in which behaviors occur. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month, community-based family dyad intervention in promoting engagement in and maintenance of PA and healthy eating among Latino adults residing in three predominantly Latino communities in Houston, TX. Dyads will be randomly assigned to a promotora-led intervention, ""Tu Salud, ¡Si Cuenta! - Familia"" (TSSC-Family) plus community change or to community change only. TSSC-Family will consist of six home visits delivered to dyad members over a six-month period to build behavioral skills and social support for sustained healthy behavior change. Community change will consist of local efforts to enhance availability of PA resources and healthy foods in the three communities. Study participants will include 650 Latino adults not currently meeting PA or dietary recommendations recruited and enrolled as family member dyads (n=325 dyads). This approach expands on an empirically-based motivational behavior change intervention developed by the investigative team in collaboration with community partners that has shown preliminary evidence of effectiveness for positive PA and dietary behavior change among Latino individuals. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after baseline to evaluate both intermediate and long-term effects. Primary outcomes include minutes per week of moderate-to-vigorous PA, and servings of fruits and vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, and whole grains. Self-efficacy, stage of change, social support, and social control will also be examined as potential individual and dyad-based mediators of changes in PA and nutrition. The proposed research is innovative in its use of a novel intervention that emphasizes dyadic social processes in addition to standard behavior change strategies. The intervention explicitly targets family-based social networks to foster social environments supportive of healthy behavior change using promotoras to facilitate home-based outreach and communication to this understudied population. This research is expected to yield critical insight regarding effective approaches for increasing PA and healthy eating among Latinos, the largest and among the fastest growing minority groups in the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research seeks to address Latino health disparities in chronic disease risk by evaluating a novel intervention focused on motivation, behavior skills, and family social contexts to increase physical activity and healthy eating in Latino adults. The community-engaged research approach and the use of promotoras to deliver the intervention builds community capacity and enhances the potential to effectively address health disparities. Results will yield critical information regarding effective community-based intervention approaches and facilitate understanding of how this type of intervention can work in real-world settings.",Tu Salud Si Cuenta!

"Preventing violence and racial disparities for Latino youth DESCRIPTION: This project uses Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) to address health disparities related to violence exposure among Latino youth. An important objective of the proposal is to address a significant gap in prevention science and health disparities research, by forming an academic-community partnership focused on preventing youth violence and reducing the prevalence of subsequent problem outcomes associated with violence exposure that pose a significant public health burden for Latino youth. The specific aims are to: (1) build a strong community-academic partnership to assess community needs and priorities for violence prevention through effective collaboration, shared responsibility and equity in decision-making among researchers, community agencies, and key community stakeholders; (2) identify local conditions related to experiences of violence, acculturative stress, discrimination, and other related factors to document, and highlight the Latino community's view of its own health problems related to violence and its negative effect on children and adolescents; (3) jointly sponsor meetings that address local conditions in order to heighten the community's awareness of health disparities related to violence exposure, disseminate relevant violence prevention information that stems from current research findings using both national and local data; and (4) develop and submit collaborative proposals for a CBPR intervention project to reduce/prevent violence among Latino youth. To accomplish these aims, we will build upon and strengthen existing collaborations with academic, community-based organizations, and community members. The collaborative partners and community stakeholders have identified addressing youth violence as a high priority. We will develop an advisory board and engage them in CBPR training. We will collaboratively conduct extensive formative work, including qualitative interviews and focus groups with community stakeholders, to assess priorities and potential strategies for addressing youth violence prevention. We will engage youth using photovoice, a strength-based methodology using cameras to allow participants to take a central role in assessment of their lives and communities in a flexible and accessible manner, suitable across age groups, and for the purpose of critical dialogue and reflection, and ultimately, community organization towards social action. We will invite local and national experts to engage in a reciprocal exchange of knowledge with our advisory board and with the community-at-large, through community forums. We will assess the success of the partnership in terms of the collaborative process, efficiency, empowerment, and satisfaction, and seek additional funds for a CBPR intervention project focused on community-based youth violence prevention. The community-academic partnership and infrastructure developed during this process will allow us to continue to collaborate in addressing health disparities facing Latin youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Violence exposure poses a major problem for Latino youth in the United States. Violence exposure and its negative health and mental health sequelae represent a racial disparity, occurring at disproportionately higher rates among Latino youth when compared with their non-Hispanic White counterparts. An important objective of the proposal is to address a significant gap in prevention science and health disparities research, by forming an academic-community partnership focused on preventing youth violence and reducing the prevalence of subsequent problem outcomes associated with violence exposure that pose a significant public health burden for Latino youth.",Preventing violence and racial disparities for Latino youth,8901250,R13HD075495,"['Awareness ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Decision Making ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Interview ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' prevent violence ', ' violence prevention ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' meetings ', ' empowered ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' empowerment ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R13,2015,29999,0.011510656574039095
"The Primary Care Medical Home and Preventive Service Use in Latino Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CANDIDATE: I am proposing to study how certain features of the Primary Care Medical Home (PCMH) impact the utilization of recommended preventive health services by Latino Immigrants. I will build upon my broad clinical and health policy background, using expert mentors and local research training opportunities to develop into an independent health services researcher. RESEARCH FOCUS: Latino immigrants, a rapidly growing segment of our population, underutilize routine preventive health care. Some features of the PCMH have been associated with increased utilization in some vulnerable populations, but little objective, multi-facility data exists to address the effects of these changs on Latino immigrants. The Oregon Community Health Information Network (OCHIN) is a multiple-facility linked electronic medical record that contains data capable of filling this knowledge gap. This proposal expands on existing PCMH research, and proposes to use the OCHIN Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to evaluate the association between certain PCMH principles and preventive service use in Latino immigrants. TRAINING GOALS: My training goals include (1) developing his skills in research design, analysis, and interpretation with a focus on the use of large databases to study vulnerable populations and 2) expanding my knowledge and experience in the strategies for and practice of health disparities research. ENVIRONMENT: I will undergo his career development in the Department of Family Medicine at Oregon Health Science University and through the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, two organizations with significant and longstanding resources for early-career researchers. METHODS: (1) Cross-sectional analysis of Latino immigrants in the OCHIN EHR data and their rates of utilization of lipid screening, cervical cancer screening, and pneumococcal vaccination. (2) Retrospective cohort analysis of the association between certain features of the PCMH and these preventive services in Latino immigrants. OUTCOMES: I will measure the rates of preventive service use in Latino immigrants cared for in OCHIN clinics and compare these to rates of other populations in OCHIN. I will test how select features of the PCMH will affect the rate of utilization of lipid screening, cervical cancer screening, and pneumococcal vaccination in Latino immigrants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide valuable information for medical providers and policy makers as they attempt to finance, organize, and provide routine preventive health care for low-income individuals in our communities. Specifically, our community health centers will benefit from this information as they provide preventive health care with limited resources.",The Primary Care Medical Home and Preventive Service Use in Latino Immigrants,8881102,K08HS021522,[''],AHRQ,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K08,2015,148187,0.0860180805166374
"A CBPR Initiative to Address Obesity Disparities for Latinos in the San Joaquin V DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary Nationwide, Latinos of all age groups disproportionately experience overweight and obesity morbidity and mortality. These disparities are exacerbated in communities with high rates of poverty and limited English proficiency. The eight-county region of the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California is such an area. SJV is represented by one of the highest concentrations of Latinos in the U.S., predominantly of Mexican descent. The region also has among the highest rates of undocumented, immigrant Latino populations which are largely under-represented in research and pose greater challenges in relationship with researchers. Established in 2005, the University of California, Merced (UC Merced) is the first-ever research university in the SJV and one of two Hispanic Serving Institutions in the 10-campus UC system. Since its inception UC Merced has had a strong, formal commitment to improve the well-being of SJV. Since 2006, UC Merced has grown an initiative for Community Engaged Scholarship that has contributed to multiple regional CBPR efforts with a focus on social justice and health equity. These efforts have not well reached the Latino communities in SJV nor have they addressed obesity disparities. The proposed collaboration between UC Merced, Central California Regional Obesity Prevention Program, and several regional community stakeholders will create a formal CBPR initiative to address obesity disparities among Latinos, with a focus on families and multigenerational households (common for Latinos in SJV). Traditional working partnerships, advisory boards, and conference and meeting methods will be blended with emerging CBPR approaches such as Open Space, World Cafes, Photovoice, and social media to establish a strong and sustainable network of action research that is culturally and linguistically appropriate Training and support will aim to improve the capacity of both community and academic partners to work synergistically to establish an action plan to use CBPR to address Latino obesity disparities. Advisory, planning, and action teams will be established with community-academic representatives and across community sectors (e.g.., faith, business, education) and generations. The project will produce sustainable community-academic relationships and infrastructure, and initial proposals for CBPR projects on Latino obesity/overweight disparities in the SJV.

"Detection, Understanding and Reduction of Latino Health Care Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although Latinos represent one of the fastest-growing populations entering substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, they are the most likely to lack health insurance and receive disparate care in terms of treatment access, quality, and outcomes. In particular, Mexican Americans represent the largest population of uninsured and critically underserved ethnic minority individuals in the United States. As such, it is not surprisng that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and other federal institutions have called for systematic collection of health care data on specific Latino subgroups10 to define vulnerable subpopulations, identify determinants of disparities, and prepare the health care system to develop solutions to promote health equities. The lack of representative datasets with an adequate number of Mexican Americans and information on provider quality of care to accurately explore and identify health care disparities has represented a key barrier to greater knowledge regarding strategies to improve Mexican Americans' treatment outcomes.5 Thus, using a multilevel and multiyear dataset, which includes data collected from 101 outpatient SUD treatment programs and 14,610 clients in 2011 and 2013, we will seek to detect IOM-defined disparities in terms of client achievement of 30- day sobriety at successful treatment completion. Guided by Kilbourne, Switzer, Hyman, Crowley-Matoka, and Fine's (2006) conceptual framework for advancing health disparities research, and consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) conceptual framework for public health,15 we will examine these disparities at both the individual and program level. Aim 1 will focus on detection of treatment disparities between Mexican-Americans and non-Latino Whites and Aim 2 will focus on understanding the extent to which key organizational factors (e.g., acceptance of public insurance, delivery of evidence-based treatment [EBT], and delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate services [CLAS]) may help in the reduction of these treatment disparities. Aim 3 seeks to expand upon the NICE conceptual framework by testing the extent to which increases in programs' acceptance of public insurance (i.e., Medicaid), which will expand as part of the ACA and mostly affect Latinos in Los Angeles County, may lead to improvements in quality of care (i.e., delivery of EBT and CLAS). The proposed analysis of existing data represents a timely and cost-efficient opportunity to have a large overall impact on Latino health care disparities research and policy, especially given the innovative aspect of the proposed research is to detect, understand and reduce client- and program- level disparities for Mexican Americans, who constitute the largest Latino subgroup in the United States. Finally, given the increasing focus on health care reform and its consequences (both positive and negative), the proposed study is believed to have the potential for high overall impact because it will be one of the first known studies to examine the extent to which increases in acceptance of public health insurance, which is a key component of the ACA, lead to increases in quality of care in community-based SUD treatment.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine has called for the examination of Latino subgroups in order to identify vulnerable subpopulations (e.g., Mexican Americans), as well as to better understand the causes of important disparities in health care and inform interventions to reduce such disparities. Thus, this study is of high public health relevance given it will provide federal and state insurance administrators, policy makers, and community-based substance abuse treatment providers with new and critical information to help promote health equities for the most uninsured and critically underserved ethnic minority subpopulation in the United States (i.e., Mexican Americans).            ","Detection, Understanding and Reduction of Latino Health Care Disparities",8964524,R01DA038608,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Solutions ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' intervention program ', ' treatment program ', ' sober ', ' sobriety ', ' research in practice ', ' ethnic difference ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Policy Research ', ' Subgroup ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,252870,0.0589783291223302
"Mentoring in the Context of Improving Care for Latinos with Diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The exponential growth of the US born and immigrant Latino population over the last two decades in the United States, coupled with the national increase in obesity, has led to an enormous increase in the number of Latino patients with diabetes. Effective care of these patients is often complicated by language barriers, low health literacy, and low patient engagement which all contribute to well-documented disparities in diabetes outcomes. This proposal outlines a 5 year career development plan for the candidate to expand her mentoring work with early career researchers focused on clinical and health services research dedicated to improving diabetes outcomes among low-income Latino patients. In addition to mentoring plans, the proposal outlines three specific aims to a) Identify patient perceptions of barriers and facilitators to accessing language assistance services in diabetes care; b) Explore barriers and facilitators to the establishment of healthy infant feeding habits among low income Latina women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the context of an automated telephone self-management intervention; and c) Develop and formatively evaluate a social marketing campaign aimed at encouraging Latino parents with diabetes to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption in their children aged 3-11. Through the efficient leveraging of existing resources, collaborations, data, and affiliations with NIH-funded networks, the overarching goal of this application is to promote the effective mentorship of early career investigators at all levels of the research training pipeline in Latino diabetes clinical an translational research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The enormous growth of the Latino population with diabetes poses challenges for patients, physicians, and health care systems, particularly when language barriers exist. The proposed funding will support the expanded mentoring of early career investigators--from every level of the training pipeline--in clinical and health services research dedicated to improving outcomes for low-income Latinos with diabetes.

"Neighborhood level determinants of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos by birthplace and history of injection drug use Florida 2007 2011 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Twenty percent of HIV-positive Latinos are not aware of their HIV status, and over half are diagnosed late. Persons with undiagnosed HIV infection can continue risky sexual and drug-related behavior and unknowingly put others at risk. Additionally, delayed HIV diagnosis has been shown to increase the risk of poor health outcomes and HIV-related mortality. Predictors of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos include older age, male gender, injection drug use (IDU), foreign birthplace, and low educational attainment. Studies suggest that neighborhood characteristics may also predict healthcare utilization and health outcomes and partially account for racial/ethnic disparities. Moreover, studies show that neighborhood factors, independent of individual factors, also predict HIV seroconversion and high-risk injection behavior among IDUs. Objective: The objectives of this study are to (a) examine the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos of varying origins, and (b) identify the potential moderating effects of IDU on these associations. Specifically, the study will examine the impact of neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (unemployment, poverty, and educational attainment) and ethnic density on the timing of HIV diagnosis among Latinos by country or region of birth. Design: The study will use a cross sectional study design to study Latino individuals [13 years and older] reported with HIV infection between 2007 and 2011 to the Florida Department of Health HIV/AIDS Reporting System. The American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau will be used to determine neighborhood characteristics. Cases will be matched to neighborhood characteristics based on the zip code of residence at the time of HIV diagnosis. The total sample size is [5,899]. Analysis: Mixed/random effects modeling will be used to determine the effect of neighborhood- level factors on delayed HIV diagnosis. This method will account for non-independence (spatial correlation) within and between neighborhoods. An interaction term between neighborhood-factors and injection drug use will be added to the model to test for IDU as a moderator of the relationship between neighborhood-factors and delayed HIV diagnosis. Analysis will be stratified by country/region of birth to account for the large socioeconomic, educational attainment, and health care access variability among Latinos of varying origins as well as the differences in history of IDU. Significance: [The results of this study will help identify possible structural barriers to and facilitators of HIV testing among Latinos of varying origins. This information will assist public health professionals to appropriatey target resources and design more effective and culturally competent interventions to decrease the risk of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos.] The aims of this study are parallel to NIH/NIDA's strategic plan to decrease health disparities of HIV/AIDS, prevent HIV transmission, and better understand the interaction of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this study are to (a) examine the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos of varying origins, and (b) identify the potential moderating effects of injection drug use on these associations. More specifically, the study will examine the impact of neighborhood- level socioeconomic status (unemployment, poverty, and educational attainment) and ethnic density on the timing of HIV diagnosis among Latinos. The results of this study will help target secondary HIV prevention strategies to high-risk communities and Latino groups and guide the design of more effective and culturally competent interventions in efforts to decrease the risk of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos.            ",Neighborhood level determinants of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos by birthplace and history of injection

"Misdiagnosis of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bilingual children are often misdiagnosed as having a speech disorder when they truly exhibit normal development. In addition, speech-language pathologists (SLP) are avoiding the assessment of bilingual children due to the lack of knowledge and resources necessary for best practice with this population. Misdiagnosis of speech sound disorders in this population has long-term emotional, financial, and educational costs. Misdiagnosis of speech disorders in bilingual children can be prevented if we acquire more information on what constitutes normal and disordered speech development in the bilingual population. A theoretical model that allows us to differentiate difference in speech production (i.e., a difference in how a bilingual child speaks due to the influence of one language on the other) from speech disorder (i.e., an underlying speech-learning disability) will provide SLPs with the knowledge they need to prevent misdiagnosis. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to (1) to develop a theoretical model that accounts for how between-language interaction facilitates or inhibits speech sound production in bilinguals by measuring how, and to what extent, the two languages of bilinguals interact and (2) develop evidence based diagnostic criteria for clinicians to differentiate typically- developing bilingual children rom bilingual children with speech sound disorders. Bilingual children with typical and disordered development will be compared to their English-speaking peers on measures of speech sound ability. Children will produce sounds in single words and their productions will be phonetically transcribed. Child productions will be examined, in both English and Spanish and across both languages, on common diagnostic measures used for monolingual children. Mixed effects regression models will be used to identify between- language interaction in bilingual speech and the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) will be used to determine sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic measures examined. Findings will lead to a characterization of typical and disordered speech sound development in bilingual children and diagnostic guidelines for speech-language pathologists to use in the differential diagnosis of speech difference from speech disorder. These findings will reduce diagnostic error in the identification of speech sound disorders in this population, reducing health disparities for Latino children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos are the most populous minority group in the United States and children are the largest segment of the Latino population, comprising the majority of all children in some states (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010b, 2010c). This research will address a large and growing need: Reducing health disparities between Latinos and other racial and ethnic groups. The outcomes of this study will serve to impact (1) the lives of Latino children and their families by limiting the number of children misdiagnosed with speech sound disorders in the United States and (2) speech- language pathologists who are struggling to assess and diagnose the growing number of bilingual children on their caseloads.",Misdiagnosis of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Children,9069010,R21HD081382,"['Accounting ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Civil Rights ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Hearing ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Production ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Speech-Language Pathology ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Lawyers ', ' Attorneys ', ' Guidelines ', ' Label ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Pathologist ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' phonological ', ' phonology ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Categories ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Speech Development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Address ', ' knowledge resources ', ' knowledge resource ', ' information resource ', ' Information Resources ', ' Preparation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence base ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R21,2016,186365,0.034405709751958
"A Longitudinal Analysis of Acculturation Differences between Immigrant Latino Parents and Youth: Implications on Family Functioning and Youth Development ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children of Latino-origin immigrants are the fastest growing sector of the US child population (Passel, 2011). Thus, it is important to examine how experiences in a country that is not the family's country of origin impinges on youth development. The proposed study seeks to examine how parent-youth acculturation differences (AD) among Latino immigrant families are directly and indirectly linked to youth emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning. Research examining the AD-youth outcomes relationship has rendered mixed findings (Telzer, 2010). Some work indicates a problematic association between AD on youth socio-emotional (Schofield, Parke, Kim, Coltrane, 2008), substance use (Marsiglia, Nagoshi, Parsai, Booth, & Castro, 2014), and behavioral (Szapocznik, Santisteban, Kurtines, Ferez-Vidal & Hervis, 1984) outcomes, while other work does not. Several methodological, conceptual, and measurement limitations have been noted in the current body of work. To reconcile these inconsistencies this study seeks to examine longitudinally: (1) how AD affects family processes that are central to youth development and are salient for immigrant families; (2) how AD affects youth emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning; and (3) how AD indirectly affects youth development through its effects on family processes. A sample of 450 Latino immigrant families will be recruited from high schools in the Central California area. Data will be collected every year for three years from these families on: parent and youth dimensions of acculturation (i.e., cultural values, identity, and language use); family processes that are important for youth development in general (i.e., parental monitoring, communication, and cohesion) and those that are salient among immigrant families (i.e., language brokering and parentification); and youth socio-emotional well-being, risk behaviors, academic achievement, and self-regulation. This study is positioned to make several important contributions to this area of research by: using a multidimensional approach in the measurement of acculturation; examining the longitudinal ramifications of AD on youth development; utilizing a statistically novel approach (latent- difference score analyses) to calculate the AD; identifying specific family processes that serve as mechanisms of influence in the AD-youth outcomes relationship; and informing future prevention efforts geared towards improving the well-being and reducing health disparities among Latino immigrant youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Parent-youth acculturation differences (AD) have been linked, albeit inconsistently, to problematic youth health behaviors such as: tobacco use (Elder et al., 2005), risky sexual practices (Schwartz, 2012), and substance use (Martinez, 2006). What remains unclear and necessitates further examination is the role family processes play in AD-youth outcomes relationship. The proposed study is poised to contribute greatly in the understanding of how the family unit can be used as a mechanism of influence in the AD-youth outcomes relationship to promote positive health and development among 2nd generation immigrant Latino youth.        ",A Longitudinal Analysis of Acculturation Differences between Immigrant Latino Parents and Youth: Implications on Family Functioning and Youth Development,8999624,SC2HD090724,"['Accounting ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Berry ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Parents ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Immigrant ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' high school ', ' peer ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' parent monitoring ', ' parental monitoring ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NICHD,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FRESNO,SC2,2016,140000,0.015986104967029385
"ESCALA (Escuela y Carrera Latina/Latino School and Career) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project will develop ESCALA (Escuela y Carrera Latina/Latino School and Career), a mobile web app designed to increase the college and lowest educational attainment in the United States. Because educational attainment is a major social    determinant of health, it is not surprising that Latinos also experience poor health outcomes compared to whites, especially in the areas of obesity, depression, diabetes, and teen pregnancy. Although Latino parents recognize education as vital to their children's future, Latino adolescents perceive postsecondary education as largely unattainable due to a lack of viable role models for students, parents' unfamiliarity with college preparation processes, limited English skills, cultural differences between students and teachers, and having to financially support their family, especially in the case of Latina teenage mothers. In response to these identified barriers, ESCALA proposes to impact Latino students' college and career preparedness by intervening with students, parents, and school staff. The ESCALA app will include (a) dual language (Spanish/English), culturally relevant training videos that clarify the college prep process, (b) action plans for accomplishing concrete goals, and (c) decision‐making tools with which to facilitate informed choices about students' post‐secondary education aims. To ensure that Latino families have ready access to these materials, we will make the intervention available through mobile (i.e., smartphone) technology, which has rapidly established itself as an important communication tool among Latinos.  Phase I will focus on development of a scaled‐down prototype of ESCALA that can be ""scaled out"" in Phase II. Development will occur with focus groups, consultant input, and usability testing. We will conduct an initial evaluation with a sample of 40 Latino students and their parents to determine the social validity, perceived efficacy, behavioral intention to use the learned strategies, and satisfaction with the program's tone and content. In Phase II, we will complete the parent and student components of ESCALA and add the module for school personnel. We will then evaluate the entire program's efficacy in a large randomized controlled trial.    The project's Principal Investigators and development and research personnel are fluent Spanish speakers with familial ties to Mexican, Central American, and Caribbean cultures. Project team members have years of experience in translational research involving media and Internet technologies. The project benefits from partnership with Dr. Charles Martinez from the Center for Equity Promotion at the University of Oregon, and Dr. Matt Coleman from the Educational Policy Improvement Center and Springfield Public Schools, serving a large Latino student population. The necessary institutional support, equipment and physical resources are available to develop and disseminate the program. IRIS Ed has a history of completing Phase I and Phase II SBIR projects, and prides itself on its commitment to successfully commercializing training interventions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: To improve Latino students' college readiness, we propose to develop ESCALA, a program that provides students, parents, and school staff with training in how to meet specific milestones along the path towards college readiness. To maximize accessibility, ESCALA will be an app available through mobile (i.e., smartphone) technology. Latinos currently have the lowest educational attainment in the United States and relatedly poor health outcomes as compared to whites.

"Exito Latino Cancer Research Leadership Training ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer has overtaken heart disease as the top Latino killer; however few Latinos seek doctoral degrees and enter the field of cancer control research, particularly in the behavioral sciences. In response, Éxito! Latino Cancer Research Leadership Training, was launched in 2010 by the Institute for Health Promotion Research (IHPR) at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) with the long-term goal of increasing the number of master's-level students and master's trained health professionals entering - and completing - doctoral programs and focusing their careers on cancer control research among Latinos. For the proposed second funding cycle, the Éxito! program will continue to recruit an annual cohort of participants from across the U.S. and provide them with support along the pipeline from master's to doctoral level training. The five aims to accomplish our overarching goal are to: 1) conduct an annual five-day summer institute for 25 participants; 2) award up to 10 annual paid summer internships in Latino cancer control research; 3) promote retention throughout the graduate pipeline with web-based academic support and career-building opportunities that include peer-to-peer professional support, interactive online communication forums, and facilitated connections to pre-and post-doctoral programs; 4) achieve doctoral enrollment rate of 30% or more, at most 15% doctoral-student attrition, and at least 50% of doctoral students conducting cancer control research; and 5) develop and implement active and passive dissemination plans by sharing the program with at least two Hispanic Serving Institutions and presenting project findings at professional meetings and in peer- reviewed literature. Program evaluation will include process, impact, and outcome measurements to monitor participant's academic progress as well as the influence of the Éxito! program on intention and efficacy regarding pursuit of the doctorate and career in cancer research. The Éxito! program continues to align well with the mission of the IHPR, which is ""to research the causes and solutions to the unequal impact of cancer and chronic disease affecting residents of South Texas and the nation to improve the health of all people while serving as a national model for health promotion research and education."" Further, the Éxito! program complements other UTHSCSA-wide federally-funded training programs as the only Latino training program focused on doctoral-level preparation in the social, behavioral and public health sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Americans of Latino descent are affected by cancer at a higher rate than other groups, however they are underrepresented in doctoral programs and careers in cancer control research. It is important that the professionals who conduct cancer control research represent the populations who suffer an excess burden of disease.

"Salud Juntos: A Promotora-Led Home-Based Cancer Care Support Solution ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA EB-15-001, a special SBIR program to reduce health disparities by developing medical technologies that are ""effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and easily accessible to those who need them."" It is based on the well-established partnership between BrightOutcome and Dr. Ana Maria Lopez, Associate Vice President for Health Equity and Inclusion, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, and Director of Cancer Health Equity, Huntsman Cancer Institute. We propose co-development of ¡Salud Juntos!, a bilingual ""high tech and high touch"" medical care support portal for Latinos, the most rapidly growing group in the U.S. By leveraging both e-health technologies and actual human connections. ¡Salud Juntos!'s can expand to encompass health concerns comprehensively. Our target domain for this project will be the cancer care continuum, from cancer diagnosis/treatment though survivorship/palliation, with Phase I focusing on cancer symptom management. The ""high tech"" aspect of ¡Salud Juntos! utilizes technology features such as mobile access, social media support, adaptive health status assessment, and individualized content deliveries to connect patients and families to care. The ""high touch"" aspect, a critical and unique component of ¡Salud Juntos!, facilitates patient engagement through community health workers/promotoras who can personally deliver the requisite education and support to individuals and the community. ¡Salud Juntos!'s high-tech features will be adapted for promotoras to use to manage their day-to-day tasks. The use of both high-tech and high-touch solutions ensures a broad reach across the digital divide and addresses health delivery barriers including knowledge, culture, and distance. The overarching goal of ¡Salud Juntos! is to improve cancer patients' outcomes and self-efficacy by empowering cancer patients with self-management skills and bringing cancer care support directly to them at home via both promotoras and technology. Such supportive care, regardless whether delivered by promotoras or by technology, addresses both physical and psychosocial concerns and needs of cancer patients by offering timely patient education materials, engaging local/community support resources, facilitating patient-provider communication, and involving patients caregivers, friends and families. Phase I aims are to: 1) Collect input from stakeholders on expected system features, perceived usefulness/impacts, and potential adoption barriers via four focus groups of ten subjects each. Stakeholders include promotoras, supportive care professionals, Latino cancer patients, and their caregivers; 2) Design/develop the prototype ¡Salud Juntos! by following a user-centered design process and leveraging the technical/functional foundations from our prior work; 3) Conduct two rounds of usability/usefulness tests with 32 subjects each, and a pilot study with 60 subjects randomized to receive usual care (control) and promotora support with ¡Salud Juntos! (intervention) on a 1:1 ratio to conduct preliminary effectiveness evaluation and assess technical feasibility.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos are now the largest and the fastest growing minority group in the U.S. However, the health disparities experienced by Latinos in the U.S. have been well documented. Based on the 2001-2005 AHRQ's Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data, the median healthcare expenditure for Latinos was 78.8% lower than that for White, non-Latinos. It is estimated that reducing the health disparities for Latinos would have saved the US economy a staggering $115 billion between 2006 and 2009. We propose to develop ¡Salud Juntos!, a bilingual ""high tech and high touch"" medical care support portal for Latinos by leveraging both e-health technology solutions and actual human connections via promotores to ensure a broad reach across the digital divide and addresses health delivery barriers including knowledge, culture, and distance.            ",Salud Juntos: A Promotora-Led Home-Based Cancer Care Support Solution,9074893,R43MD011210,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' Family ', ' Fees ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hybrids ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Institutes ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Population Growth ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' survivorship ', ' Technology ', ' Medical Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Utah ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Businesses ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Licensing ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Supportive care ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' empowered ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Center Director ', ' cancer research center director ', ' Health Sciences ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' cost ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' prototype ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' palliation ', ' health equity ', ' eHealth ', ' e-Health ', ' social media ', ' symptom self management ', ' ']",NIMHD,BRIGHTOUTCOME INC.,R43,2016,186930,0.10007717530498768
"Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors in Puerto Rican Youth Growing Up DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use/abuse (SU/SUD) and other HIV/STI risk behaviors are major public health challenges not equally distributed across racial/ethnic groups. The fastest growing minority population in the US, Latino  youth, have elevated rates HIV/STI risk behaviors and SU/SUD, particularly among those abandoning  traditional Latino values and shifting towards American values (acculturation). This application, in response to  PA-09-236: HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations in the US (R01), aims to identify factors related  to the development of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection among Latino youth during a critical  transitional developmental period: emerging adulthood. Existing studies have revealed important disparities, however, they are limited in their ability to identify processes relevant for Latino youth, as they have not included sufficient numbers of Latino youth from fairly homogeneous subgroups (e.g.  Puerto Ricans, Mexican- Americans, etc.) and lack information about acculturation, a key determinant of risk among Latino youth. We propose to conduct the fourth wave on the Boricua Youth Study (BYS~ R01 MH56401) focused on HIV/STI risk, infection in emerging adulthood (BYS Wave 4, N=1,992, youth ages 16 - 24). The BYS has already generated 3 waves of data (years 2001 to 2004) on children of Puerto Rican background (ages 5 -13 at Wave 1), with study findings described in 19 peer-reviewed publications to date. Besides the comprehensive longitudinal assessment strategy, a unique feature of the BYS is its two-site design, as it included children living in the South Bronx (SBx), NYC and San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR). At BYS Wave 4, we propose to conduct intensive assessment of HIV/STI risk (including testing for HIV and STIs) and enhance the assessment of SU/SUD, in addition to continuing tracking of cultural experiences, and psychiatric disorders and other factors. The proposed study has as its specific aims, to examine: (I) Prevalence of HIV/STI risk behaviors and rates of HIV/STI infection in emerging adulthood and the influence of sexual orientation, teenage unintended pregnancy and early sexual debut. (II) How development of SU/SUD (nicotine, alcohol, illicit/prescription drugs) starting in childhood/earlyadolescence may influence HIV/STI risk in emerging adulthood in the context of a  Ecodevelopmental framework. (III) The role of acculturation (cultural practices, identification, values) in relation to SU/SUD and its relationship to HIV/STI risk behaviors/infection.   Once Wave 4 is completed, the BYS will represent an unparalleled source of prospective information  about onset of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection  as well as persistence and progression of SU  from childhood to emerging adulthood in a homogeneous Latino subgroup examined in two contexts (SBx and  PR).This information will fill a gap in knowledge, and the model resulting from our investigation will enable and  facilitate the integration of specific factrs of relevance for Latino youth (e.g., acculturation) as part of  interventions for this high-risk group. A population-based longitudinal study is the best strategy to understand specific mechanisms involved in processes determining HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in relation to substance use and abuse among high-risk youth who are part of the fastest growing US minority group194 and whose risk experience have not been properly addressed to date (given for example, the superficial assessment as issues such as acculturation). By adding a 4th wave of data to the Boricua Youth Study (which started about 10 years ago), we can, in 5 years (rather than in 15, if a cohort like that had to established today a a very high cost), close a key gap in knowledge and generate information about risk and protective factors as well as mechanisms  operating in the determination HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in the lives of a high-risk Latino group  (Puerto Ricans), directly informing highly needed intervention advancement, contributing to revert important  health disparities.",Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors

"Tu Salud Si Cuenta!  Reaching Latino family dyads to increase physical activity and healthy eating ABSTRACT Most adults in the U.S. fail to meet national physical activity (PA) and dietary recommendations, and Latinos are less likely to meet these recommendations than non-Latino Whites. Physical inactivity, a poor diet, and obesity are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and stroke and are important contributors to preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Social environments are widely recognized to have an important impact on these behaviors, yet most behavior change programs give limited attention to the social contexts in which behaviors occur. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month, community-based family dyad intervention in promoting engagement in and maintenance of PA and healthy eating among Latino adults residing in three predominantly Latino communities in Houston, TX. Dyads will be randomly assigned to a community health worker (CHW)-led intervention, “Tu Salud, ¡Si Cuenta! – Familiar” (TSSC-Family) or to a contact control condition focused on healthy homes. TSSC-Family will consist of six home visits delivered to dyad members over a six-month period to build behavioral skills and social support for sustained healthy behavior change among Latino family dyads. The healthy homes contact control will also consist of six monthly visits delivered to dyad members by a CHW. Study participants will include 552 Latino adults not currently meeting PA or nutrition recommendations recruited and enrolled as family member dyads (n=276 dyads). This approach expands on an empirically- based motivational behavior change intervention developed by a member of the investigative team in collaboration with community partners that has shown preliminary evidence of effectiveness for positive PA and dietary behavior change in Latino individuals. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after baseline to evaluate both intermediate and long-term effects. Primary outcomes include minutes per week of moderate and vigorous PA, and servings of fruits and vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, and whole grains. Weight loss is a secondary outcome. Self-efficacy, stage of change, social support, and social control will also be examined as potential mediators of changes in PA and nutrition. The proposed research is innovative in its use of a novel intervention that emphasizes dyadic social processes in addition to standard behavior change strategies. The intervention explicitly targets family-based social networks to foster social environments supportive of healthy behavior change using CHWs to facilitate home-based outreach and communication to this understudied population. This research is expected to yield critical insight regarding effective approaches for increasing PA and healthy eating among Latinos, the largest and among the fastest growing minority groups in the U.S. NARRATIVE The proposed research seeks to address Latino health disparities in chronic disease risk by evaluating a novel intervention focused on motivation, behavior skills, and family social contexts to increase physical activity and healthy eating in Latino adults. The community-engaged research approach and the use of community health workers to deliver the intervention builds community capacity and enhances the potential to effectively address health disparities. Results will yield critical information regarding effective community-based intervention approaches and facilitate understanding of how this type of intervention can work in real-world settings.",Tu Salud Si Cuenta!

"Participatory Trial of a Health Promoting School Approach to Positive Youth Development and Wellness Promotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The overarching goal of this study is to address key adolescent health issues (substance use, emotional well-being, developmental assets) and critical social determinants of health (academic engagement and achievement) for all students, but 9th grade youth of Latino, Hmong, Somali and other African heritage in particular, through a focus on student-school connectedness and the school environment. The school environment, including student-teacher relationships and opportunities for meaningful student participation, establishes student connectedness, leading to multiple health-protective outcomes. However youth of color often express less connection to school. Health Promoting Schools' interventions may improve connectedness by addressing 3 components: 1) classroom wellbeing topics/approaches, 2) school environment or ethos, 3) links with families and/or communities. We will build on a NIMHD (R24MD00766-01)-funded pilot that developed and evaluated Project TRUST (Training for Resiliency in Urban Students and Teachers), an intervention to support teachers in improving relationships with, and promoting PYD for Somali, Latino, and Hmong 9th grade youth. Core partners Somali, Latino and Hmong Partnership for Health and Wellness (SoLaHmo), University of Minnesota Program in Health Disparities Research and College of Education and Human Development along with teachers, parents, and youth co-developed and piloted the intervention. Findings suggest that Project TRUST is feasible and acceptable to educators and may improve youth educational engagement, emotional well-being, and developmental assets across race/ethnic groups. Findings identified the need for broader improvements in the school environment and involvement with parents to substantively improve connectedness. In the current proposal we will expand our CBPR Coalition to co-direct refinement and implementation of a multi- component Health Promoting Schools intervention including: 1) pilot-tested teacher professional development, 2) student- defined enhanced environment, and 3) parent-defined enhanced community/family connection. The Coalition will finalize the intervention using a phased intervention map that integrates community perspectives with theoretical approaches to PYD and evidence based practices. The study aims will be accomplished through a group randomized trial in 10 urban schools with diverse populations representing approximately 1,900 students. Study aims are: Aim 1: Assess the effects of a school-based multi-component intervention on improved school connectedness, school engagement, and developmental assets through a group randomized, participatory trial. Aim 2: Assess the effects of a health promoting schools multi-component intervention on emotional well-being, tobacco and other substance use, and academic outcomes through a group randomized, participatory trial. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationships between participatory factors (CBPR collaborative processes, capacities, and contextual factors), school intervention implementation, and study outcomes. The focus on school connectedness and environment as key proximal social determinants of health and promising intervention targets is innovative while the CBPR approach assures project success and sustainability.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of our study is to use a community based participatory research approach to implement and evaluate a multi-component school-based intervention to enhance emotional well-being and academic achievement, and prevent tobacco and other substance use through the promotion of student-school connectedness for all students, but Latino, Hmong, Somali and other African heritage 9th grade youth in particular. We will build on a NIMHD -funded pilot that developed and evaluated Project TRUST (Training for Resiliency in Urban Students and Teachers), an intervention to support teachers in improving relationships with, and promoting positive youth development for Somali, Latino, and Hmong 9th grade youth. This project is important as it addresses school connected and engagement as key social determinants of health and addresses important protective factors contributing to youth resiliency.        ",Participatory Trial of a Health Promoting School Approach to Positive Youth Development and Wellness Promotion,9129239,U01MD010586,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human Development ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Minnesota ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Schools ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Universities ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' African ', ' Funding ', ' programs ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Outcome Study ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school freshman ', ' 9th grade ', ' ninth grade ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Reporting ', ' positive youth development ', ' Emotional ', ' behavioral health ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' social health determinants ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' student participation ', ' student motivation ', ' student engagement ', ' Future Teacher ', ' student teacher ', ' pre-service teacher ', ' future faculty ', ' Preservice teacher ', ' adolescent health ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,U01,2016,491831,0.005865896454369567
"Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors in Puerto Rican Youth Growing Up DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substance use/abuse (SU/SUD) and other HIV/STI risk behaviors are major public health challenges not equally distributed across racial/ethnic groups. The fastest growing minority population in the US, Latino  youth, have elevated rates HIV/STI risk behaviors and SU/SUD, particularly among those abandoning  traditional Latino values and shifting towards American values (acculturation). This application, in response to  PA-09-236: HIV/AIDS, Drug Use, and Vulnerable Populations in the US (R01), aims to identify factors related  to the development of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection among Latino youth during a critical  transitional developmental period: emerging adulthood. Existing studies have revealed important disparities, however, they are limited in their ability to identify processes relevant for Latino youth, as they have not included sufficient numbers of Latino youth from fairly homogeneous subgroups (e.g.  Puerto Ricans, Mexican- Americans, etc.) and lack information about acculturation, a key determinant of risk among Latino youth. We propose to conduct the fourth wave on the Boricua Youth Study (BYS~ R01 MH56401) focused on HIV/STI risk, infection in emerging adulthood (BYS Wave 4, N=1,992, youth ages 16 - 24). The BYS has already generated 3 waves of data (years 2001 to 2004) on children of Puerto Rican background (ages 5 -13 at Wave 1), with study findings described in 19 peer-reviewed publications to date. Besides the comprehensive longitudinal assessment strategy, a unique feature of the BYS is its two-site design, as it included children living in the South Bronx (SBx), NYC and San Juan, Puerto Rico (PR). At BYS Wave 4, we propose to conduct intensive assessment of HIV/STI risk (including testing for HIV and STIs) and enhance the assessment of SU/SUD, in addition to continuing tracking of cultural experiences, and psychiatric disorders and other factors. The proposed study has as its specific aims, to examine: (I) Prevalence of HIV/STI risk behaviors and rates of HIV/STI infection in emerging adulthood and the influence of sexual orientation, teenage unintended pregnancy and early sexual debut. (II) How development of SU/SUD (nicotine, alcohol, illicit/prescription drugs) starting in childhood/earlyadolescence may influence HIV/STI risk in emerging adulthood in the context of a  Ecodevelopmental framework. (III) The role of acculturation (cultural practices, identification, values) in relation to SU/SUD and its relationship to HIV/STI risk behaviors/infection.   Once Wave 4 is completed, the BYS will represent an unparalleled source of prospective information  about onset of SU/SUD and HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection  as well as persistence and progression of SU  from childhood to emerging adulthood in a homogeneous Latino subgroup examined in two contexts (SBx and  PR).This information will fill a gap in knowledge, and the model resulting from our investigation will enable and  facilitate the integration of specific factrs of relevance for Latino youth (e.g., acculturation) as part of  interventions for this high-risk group. A population-based longitudinal study is the best strategy to understand specific mechanisms involved in processes determining HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in relation to substance use and abuse among high-risk youth who are part of the fastest growing US minority group194 and whose risk experience have not been properly addressed to date (given for example, the superficial assessment as issues such as acculturation). By adding a 4th wave of data to the Boricua Youth Study (which started about 10 years ago), we can, in 5 years (rather than in 15, if a cohort like that had to established today a a very high cost), close a key gap in knowledge and generate information about risk and protective factors as well as mechanisms  operating in the determination HIV/STI risk behaviors and infection in the lives of a high-risk Latino group  (Puerto Ricans), directly informing highly needed intervention advancement, contributing to revert important  health disparities.",Substance Use/Abuse & HIV/STI Risk Behaviors

"Neighborhood level determinants of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos by birthplace and history of injection drug use Florida 2007 2011 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: Twenty percent of HIV-positive Latinos are not aware of their HIV status, and over half are diagnosed late. Persons with undiagnosed HIV infection can continue risky sexual and drug-related behavior and unknowingly put others at risk. Additionally, delayed HIV diagnosis has been shown to increase the risk of poor health outcomes and HIV-related mortality. Predictors of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos include older age, male gender, injection drug use (IDU), foreign birthplace, and low educational attainment. Studies suggest that neighborhood characteristics may also predict healthcare utilization and health outcomes and partially account for racial/ethnic disparities. Moreover, studies show that neighborhood factors, independent of individual factors, also predict HIV seroconversion and high-risk injection behavior among IDUs. Objective: The objectives of this study are to (a) examine the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos of varying origins, and (b) identify the potential moderating effects of IDU on these associations. Specifically, the study will examine the impact of neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (unemployment, poverty, and educational attainment) and ethnic density on the timing of HIV diagnosis among Latinos by country or region of birth. Design: The study will use a cross sectional study design to study Latino individuals [13 years and older] reported with HIV infection between 2007 and 2011 to the Florida Department of Health HIV/AIDS Reporting System. The American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau will be used to determine neighborhood characteristics. Cases will be matched to neighborhood characteristics based on the zip code of residence at the time of HIV diagnosis. The total sample size is [5,899]. Analysis: Mixed/random effects modeling will be used to determine the effect of neighborhood- level factors on delayed HIV diagnosis. This method will account for non-independence (spatial correlation) within and between neighborhoods. An interaction term between neighborhood-factors and injection drug use will be added to the model to test for IDU as a moderator of the relationship between neighborhood-factors and delayed HIV diagnosis. Analysis will be stratified by country/region of birth to account for the large socioeconomic, educational attainment, and health care access variability among Latinos of varying origins as well as the differences in history of IDU. Significance: [The results of this study will help identify possible structural barriers to and facilitators of HIV testing among Latinos of varying origins. This information will assist public health professionals to appropriatey target resources and design more effective and culturally competent interventions to decrease the risk of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos.] The aims of this study are parallel to NIH/NIDA's strategic plan to decrease health disparities of HIV/AIDS, prevent HIV transmission, and better understand the interaction of drug abuse and HIV/AIDS.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objectives of this study are to (a) examine the relationship between neighborhood characteristics and delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos of varying origins, and (b) identify the potential moderating effects of injection drug use on these associations. More specifically, the study will examine the impact of neighborhood- level socioeconomic status (unemployment, poverty, and educational attainment) and ethnic density on the timing of HIV diagnosis among Latinos. The results of this study will help target secondary HIV prevention strategies to high-risk communities and Latino groups and guide the design of more effective and culturally competent interventions in efforts to decrease the risk of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos.            ",Neighborhood level determinants of delayed HIV diagnosis among Latinos by birthplace and history of injection drug use Florida 2007 2011,9027689,F31DA037790,"['healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Sample Size ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' AIDS diagnosis ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' 13 year old ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' surveillance data ', ' injection drug use ', ' Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth History ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Censuses ', ' Central America ', ' Communities ', ' Community Surveys ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cuba ', ' Diagnosis ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Florida ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Injections ', ' Injection of therapeutic agent ', ' Insurance ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Birth Place ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Gender ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' ']",NIDA,FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,13760,0.0631023366832752
"Optimizing Educational Video Designs to Improve Minority Organ Donor Registration DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. organ donation system remains in a perpetual state of crisis. Over 115,000 patients in the U.S. are waiting for organ transplants, and the waitlist increases by several thousand annually despite over 10,000 dying or becoming too sick to receive a transplant. Latinos are disproportionally affected by this organ crisis due to their higher prevalence of diabetes and end-stage renal disease from inadequate access to treatment. Of the 115,000 waiting, over 95,000 require kidneys, and of these, 19.2 percent are Latino despite Latinos comprising only 16.7 percent of the U.S. population. Latinos also comprise 15.8 percent of recipients but only 13.1 percent of donors. These rates remain well below the disproportionate need since organs best match when donors and recipients are of similar race. We will investigate means for improving organ donor registration among Latinos using educational videos about uncontrolled donation after circulatory death (uDCDD) produced and distributed in partnership with our network of Latino owned barbershops and beauty parlors. uDCDD programs consider candidates for donation no matter timing or location of death, so long as consideration occurs after all life sustaining efforts are exhausted. Video content will include live footage from uDCDD programs in Spain, which has markedly improved rates of kidney transplantation compared to the U.S. If successful, we estimate that uDCDD programs could provide 22,000 more donation opportunities annually in the U.S. Educational models will inform the design of our uDCDD videos to test how genre (expert testimonials, documentary with live uDCDD footage) and ending choices (uplifting, negative consequences, unresolved) impact immediate registration after viewing. Our application is a 3-phase qualitative and quantitative research design that includes an intervention development phase using qualitative interviewing to both derive and provide culturally specific content for the videos (Aim 1); a 2x3 randomized controlled trial, in which we will randomize customers to receive one of six videos delivered with iPads, after which an immediate organ donation opportunity will be offered through registration online or with a mail application (Aim 2); and a failure analysis whereby we will interview some of the participants from the randomized trial who failed to register one month after their educational session to ascertain their reasons (Aim 3). This research will provide a model for future studies, in which we will modify our videos based on our research findings and distribute them in Latino-owned barbershops and beauty parlors using large screen TVs or interactive kiosks. Through this work, we hope to reduce organ transplantation disparities through increased registration among Latinos who comprise a group having a disproportionally greater need for kidney transplants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This research will use educational videos to inspire increased organ donor registration among Dominicans and Puerto Ricans who visit Latino owned barbershops and beauty parlors, a community setting where we have previously shown with our cardiovascular health promotion and cancer prevention research constitutes a unique peer network that can be utilized to promote healthy behavior for customers. Videos will present how uncontrolled donation after circulatory determination of death (uDCDD) programs that consider candidates for donation no matter timing or location of death, so long as consideration occurs after all life sustaining efforts are exhausted, are promising means for solving the organ donation crisis for Latinos, a population with disproportionally greater need.

"Addressing acquiescence: Reducing survey error to promote Latino health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Numerous advances have improved our ability to collect valid and reliable data on health behaviors and outcomes. However, health behaviors are often influenced by psychosocial variables - such as attitudes and beliefs - that are unobservable and, thus, more difficult to measure. Attitudes and beliefs are typically measured using Likert-scaled items, in which respondents rate their agreement with statements along a continuum. Since the 1920s, researchers have observed that some respondents tend to systematically agree to Likert-scaled questionnaire items, regardless of question content. This pattern of responding to survey questions is known as acquiescent response style (ARS). ARS jeopardizes efforts to reduce health disparities. ARS can weaken health experts' understanding of what factors influence health behaviors, their ability to create effective interventions, and th accuracy with which they evaluate programs to reduce health disparities. Research indicates that ARS use may be influenced by culture, and, in the U.S., may be of particular concern when surveying Latino populations. Research by the investigators and others suggests that 22-24 percent of Latino survey respondents acquiesce on health surveys, as compared to 13 percent of non-Latino Whites. These culturally patterned differences in ARS may introduce error in health survey data, which, in turn, may artificially create or enhance distinctions both within Latino populations and between Latinos and non-Latino Whites, thereby erroneously informing health disparities research. The Latino population is demographically and culturally diverse, and almost nothing is known about what factors may drive ARS use among Latinos from different ethnic or cultural groups. Further, despite a growing need to obtain valid health data from Latinos, who comprise 16 percent of the U.S. population and are expected to increase to 29 percent by 2050, it is unclear how to address ARS. The proposed study will: (1) identify predictors of ARS; and (2) screen for the most promising methods of reducing ARS during data collection and adjusting for ARS after data collection is complete. This research focuses on Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans, as these groups comprise the three largest Latino sub-groups. Data from this study will be derived from two surveys. The first survey will gather data from 2900 Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Cuban Americans, and non-Latino Whites in order to identify factors associated with ARS. The second survey will compare different methods of addressing ARS among 1161 Mexican American, Puerto Rican, and Cuban American health survey respondents. Findings from this research will provide researchers with empirically driven guidance on when to anticipate and how to reduce ARS-associated measurement error when surveying Latino respondents. Such knowledge will improve health data validity through increased ARS awareness and standardization of methods to address ARS, thereby contributing to more accurate understanding of the psychosocial determinants of Latino health, more effective health promotion programs targeting Latinos, and better long-term Latino health outcomes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will enhance our ability to address an important source of health survey measurement error, which, when unaddressed, may weaken our understanding of moderators and mediators of health behaviors, our ability to create effective interventions, and the accuracy of our efforts to evaluate programs to redress Latino health disparities. Findings from this research will empower health researchers to make empirically guided decisions about the collection and treatment of survey data as they promote the health of the U.S.'s growing, culturally diverse Latino population.",Addressing acquiescence: Reducing survey error to promote Latino health,9057476,R01CA172283,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cuban American ', ' Data Collection ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Health Surveys ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Play ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Desirabilities ', ' Social Desirability ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Health behavior outcomes ', ' psychosocial ', ' empowered ', ' quantitative literacy ', ' proficient in math ', ' numeracy ', ' number sense ', ' mathematical proficiency ', ' mathematical compentency ', ' mathematical compentence ', ' mathematical achievement ', ' mathematic proficiency ', ' mathematic compentency ', ' mathematic compentence ', ' mathematic achievement ', ' mathematic ability ', ' math proficiency ', ' math competency ', ' math competence ', ' math achievement ', ' math ability ', ' mathematical ability ', ' trait ', ' Agreement ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Collection ', ' health literacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' stem ', ' effective intervention ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' health data ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AT COLUMBIA,R01,2016,597516,0.19886768627056653
"Apoyo Con Carino: Patient Navigation to Improve Palliative Care for Seriously Ill Latinos Project Summary Latinos are more likely to experience uncontrolled pain, institutional death, and are less likely to engage in advance care planning. Efforts to increase access to palliative care must maximize primary palliative care and community based models to meet the ever growing need in a culturally-sensitive and congruent manner. Patient navigator interventions are community based, culturally tailored models of care and have been successfully implemented to improve disease prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. We have developed and implemented a patient navigation intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for seriously ill hospitalized Latinos. We have demonstrated feasibility and early findings suggest this intervention can improve palliative care outcomes for Latinos with advanced cancer. Building on this prior research, we propose a fully powered randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of the manualized patient navigator intervention in a non-cancer population. A total of 240 Latino adults with non-cancer, advanced medical illness enrolled from 8 urban and 4 rural clinical sites will be randomized to the intervention group (5 palliative care-related patient navigator visits plus educational materials) or control group (usual care plus educational materials). Participants randomized to the intervention group will demonstrate better quality of life, will be more likely to have a palliative approach to their care, have higher rates of advance care planning, better pain and symptom control, and higher rates of hospice utilization compared to the control group). We will conduct a cost analysis of the patient navigator intervention by comparing direct costs of the intervention and cost and utilization of health care system resources across the study arms. Participants randomized to the intervention will have lower costs in the 6 months following study enrollment compared to participants in the control arm. Decedent participants randomized to the intervention will have lower costs in the last 3 months of life compared to decedent participants in the control arm. For the intervention visits, bicultural, bilingual navigators (guias) integrate core Latino values, while addressing barriers to a palliative approach through education, culturally tailored messaging, and patient activation. Patients will be interviewed at baseline and 3 months using the QUAL- E quality of life scale, Brief Pain Inventory, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and the Patient Navigator Process and Outcomes Measure. Medical records will be reviewed to assess advance directive completion, hospice and health care utilization and intensity of care at the end of life. This culturally tailored, evidence-based, theory driven, highly innovative patient navigation intervention has significant potential to improve palliative care for Latinos, and facilitate true health equity in palliative and end of life care. PROJECT NARATIVE Palliative care is a priority area of focus for the National Institute of Nursing Research. Despite the evidence- based benefits of palliative care, access remains limited, especially in poor urban and rural settings. Cultural and linguistic barriers may also increase disparities in palliative care for Latinos. Due to a nationwide shortage of palliative care providers and the unique cultural preferences and values of patients, our innovative study has the potential to improve palliative care outcomes and reduce health disparities in both urban and rural underserved communities.",Apoyo Con Carino: Patient Navigation to Improve Palliative Care for Seriously Ill Latinos,9162423,R01NR016467,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' advanced directive ', ' Advance Directives ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost Benefit Analyses ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Medical Records ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' member ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' care preference ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' tailored messaging ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' health equity ', ' arm ', ' two-arm study ', ' screening ', ' improved outcome ', ' navigator intervention ', ' pain symptom ', ' painful symptom ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2016,616765,0.03510580889744316
"Using Brief Interventions to Reduce Unhealthy Drinking Among Latino Day Laborers DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research fulfills the NIAAA's mission to address health disparities by reducing unhealthy drinking among a high-risk and underserved population of Latino immigrant men. Latinos are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the country and immigration to the United States (US) has increased dramatically over the last ten years. Latino men are more likely to engage in unhealthy drinking than men in other racial/ethnic groups and their alcohol use increases with time spent in the United States. Despite these disparities, Latino immigrant men are unlikely to receive evidenced-based screening and brief intervention for unhealthy drinking due to their limited access to health care. We have culturally adapted a brief intervention for this population in order to broaden its reach and increase its efficacy. This stud will test the feasibility and efficacy of offering a culturally adapted intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking among Latino day laborers, who are particularly vulnerable to unhealthy drinking given their economic and social context. The specific aims of this study are to: 1) evaluate the feasibility of offering screening and brief intervention to Latino day laborers delivered by community health workers (Promotores) at a day labor worker center; and 2) test the initial efficacy of the intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking using a randomized control group study design. Feasibility will be assessed through qualitative and quantitative assessments of recruitment, retention, reach, intervention fidelity, and participant satisfaction. We will assess changes in unhealthy drinking from baseline to eight weeks in both the intervention and the control group. We hypothesize that levels of unhealthy drinking will be lower in men in the intervention than the control group. The study uses several innovative approaches to address a significant health disparity in a high-risk and underserved population, including offering the intervention at a day labor worker center, using community health workers to deliver the brief intervention, and adapting the brief intervention to be more culturally relevat, and using tablets for data collection and providing personalized feedback. Findings will help determine the best methods for optimizing recruitment, data collection and intervention fidelity in a hard to reach population. If effective, screening and brief interventions could be implemented by community health workers in day labor worker centers nationwide, as well as a variety of other community settings. Given that Latinos are the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in the country, reducing unhealthy drinking in this population could have a significant public health impact by lowering rates of morbidity due to alcohol abuse and mortality due to cardiovascular disease, cancer and unintentional injury. Furthermore, this novel intervention approach may also be generalizable to other health issues prevalent in the Latino immigrant community. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will test the feasibility and efficacy of screening and brief intervention to reduce unhealthy drinking among Latino immigrant men in a community setting.

"Preventing Diabetes in Latino Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and related health disparities represent some of the most significant public health challenges facing society. In particular, obese Latino adolescents are disproportionately impacted by insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is an intermediate stage in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and represents a critical opportunity for intervention. The Diabetes Prevention Program established that lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes. To date, no diabetes prevention studies have been conducted in obese Latino youth with prediabetes, a highly vulnerable and underserved group. Therefore, we propose a randomized-controlled trial to test the short-term (6-month) and long-term (12-month) efficacy of a culturally-grounded, lifestyle intervention, as compared to usual care, for improving glucose tolerance and reducing diabetes risk in 120 obese Latino adolescents with prediabetes. We will further test intervention effects on quality of life, explore the potential mediating effects of changes in total, regional, nd organ fat on improving glucose tolerance and increasing insulin sensitivity, and estimate the initial incremental cost- effectiveness of the intervention as compared with usual care for improving glucose tolerance. The overall approach is framed within a multilevel Ecodevelopmental model that leverages community, family, peer, and individual factors during the critical transition period of adolescence when changes in health behaviors and health outcomes are linked to future health trajectories. The intervention is guided by Social Cognitive Theory and employs key behavioral modification strategies to enhance self-efficacy and foster social support for making and sustaining healthy behavior changes. The application builds upon extant collaborations of a transdisciplinary team of investigators working in concert with local community agencies to address critical gaps in how diabetes prevention interventions for obese Latino youth are developed, implemented and evaluated. This innovative approach is an essential step in the development of scalable, cost-effective, solution- oriented programs to prevent type 2 diabetes in this and other populations of high-risk youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are critical public health issues in youth.

"Enhancing HIV testing among Disengaged Immigrants: Contextual and Opportunity Structures ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Immigrants comprise a growing population in the United States that is disproportionately impacted by HIV but has been historically disengaged from the HIV care continuum. Latinos constitute the largest foreign born population in the country with significant numbers residing in major metropolitan areas like New York City, which comprise HIV ""hotspots"" where HIV prevalence is high. Latinos are disproportionately impacted by HIV with infection rates more than three times that of Whites. Additionally, Latinos are more likely to get tested later in their disease. Curbing HIV among Latino immigrants is critical to reaching the goals of the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), and a better understanding of factors that can influence HIV testing behaviors among this group and increase engagement in care is sorely needed. Recent contextual (social, political, and economic) shifts in the United States represent potentially impactful transitions in the broader healthcare context for immigrants. Specifically, shifts in access to social welfare and health care services may mark an unprecedented occasion where testing and linkage to care have never been more attainable for immigrants in the U.S. The proposed study seeks to understand Latino immigrants' contexts in relation to HIV testing and how they intersect with perceptions of recent macro contextual changes, synergistically expanding HIV testing opportunities and facilitating or preventing HIV testing behaviors. Phase 1 of this R36 involves in-depth interviews with Latino immigrants to obtain perspectives regarding HIV testing, perceptions of the healthcare environment and motivations for immigrants to get tested for HIV. The interviews seek to elicit perspectives on the feasibility and acceptability of targeted HIV prevention strategies for Latino immigrants to become engaged in HIV care. In Phase 2, a cross-sectional survey will be conducted with 300 Latino immigrants to examine associations between the social and resource contexts of Latino immigrants and engagement in HIV testing. Participants' receptivity to obtaining a rapid HIV test will also be assessed. The overall program of research addresses the National Institute of Health's AIDS research priorities to address the HIV pandemic through new strategies for disease prevention and improvement of disease outcomes by studying the continued disparities in HIV infection rates, access to testing and care, and treatment adherence to identify geographical, psychosocial and structural factors that could explain the disparities and suggest opportunities for novel and targeted interventions to reduce them. The primary goal of the study is to inform the future design of targeted interventions for Latino immigrants who reside in U.S. HIV ""hotspots"" across the country, by explicitly describing the role of broader contextual changes and specific HIV testing opportunities in engagement in the HIV care continuum.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latino immigrants in the U.S. comprise a large and growing population at risk for HIV infection who predominately reside in HIV ""hotspots"" like New York City and are more likely to get tested later in their HIV disease progression, but have been largely neglected in focused prevention and treatment efforts. HIV testing is an important first step in linking undiagnosed HIV positive individuals to the HIV care continuum, and with the advent of major contextual (social, political, and economic) shifts with implications for immigrants' health and social welfare context, there is a novel opportunity to increase HIV testing and linkage to care among this presently disengaged population. The proposed study examines how perceptions of macro contextual shifts among Latino immigrants in New York City can shape opportunities for HIV testing to better understand immigrants' individual level HIV-related decision making to inform future prevention interventions that empirically take into account the impact of macro-level shifts and unique factors that characterize immigrants' contexts in HIV hotspots.            ",Enhancing HIV testing among Disengaged Immigrants: Contextual and Opportunity Structures,9140959,R36MH108395,"['Accounting ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Communities ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Decision Making ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Infection ', ' Interview ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Migrant ', ' Nomads ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Randomized Trial of Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of PTSD among Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The need to provide effective treatment to Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD is critical given the high prevalence of PTSD among Latinos in comparison to other racial/ethnic groups and the projections for dramatic demographic growth of the Latino population. The committee convened by the Institute of Medicine to assess the evidence on the efficacy of treatments for PTSD reported strong evidence supporting the efficacy of exposure therapies for the treatment of PTSD. The committee further noted that although psychotherapies may present special challenges in different ethnic/cultural groups, ""the evidence is mostly silent on the acceptability, efficacy, or generalizability of treatment in ethnic and cultural minorities."" Eliminating health disparities for diverse cultural groups is a public health priority.One of the nation's health objectives presented in Healthy People 2010, called for eliminating disparities in mental health and mental health care for all racial/ethnic groups. Nevertheless, an evaluation conducted by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality in 2010 revealed that Latinos received less mental health care than other racial/ethnic groups. The report acknowledges that limited English proficiency could be a contributing factor for the gap in mental health care for Latinos. The significant impairment and the high societal costs associated with PTSD underscore the urgency of the need to make the benefits of clinical advances in the treatment of PTSD available to Latinos with limited English proficiency. The proposed study directly addresses this mental health care disparity by conducting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test Prolonged Exposure (PE) therapy with Spanish- speaking Latinos. In preliminary work, we translated and culturally adapted the PE therapy manual, maintaining fidelity to the original treatment, and conducted a pilot study that evidenced the feasibility and acceptability of PE for Spanish-speaking Latinos. As our next step, we propose to conduct a RCT with Spanish-speaking Latinos to determine whether PE is superior to applied relaxation in improving primary (PTSD symptoms) and secondary (functioning, health-related quality of life, and depression) outcomes. We will recruit 100 Latinos with PTSD, 18-65 years old, in primary care clinics. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, week 20, and week 28. This study has the potential to contribute to improvements in the overall well- being and quality of life of Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD and, by extension, likely their families as well. Misconceptions about exposure therapy can contribute to limit its adoption in clinical practices serving Latinos. If positive results are evidenced for unacculturated Latinos in Puerto Rico, characterized by dominant Latino orientation, this study would establish an evidence base for expanded research that has the potential to shift current clinical practice in mental health settings serving Latino clients by facilitating adoption of a linguistically and culturally relevan PE manual-based treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is of considerable public health significance as it will provide foundational information on the clinical use of a linguistically an culturally relevant prolonged exposure therapy for the treatment of Spanish-speaking Latinos with posttraumatic stress disorder. This study has the potential to contribute to improvements in the well-being and quality of life of Spanish-speaking Latinos with PTSD and to reduce misperceptions of exposure therapy that can contribute to limit its adoption in clinical practices serving Latinos.",Randomized Trial of Prolonged Exposure for the Treatment of PTSD among Latinos,9107491,SC1MH090599,"['Accidents ', ' Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' assault ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Client ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Military ', ' Armed Forces Personnel ', ' Military Personnel ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' forced sex ', ' Rape ', ' Forcible intercourse ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' welfare ', ' Social Welfare ', ' Societies ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Terrorism ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Solid ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' sexually abused ', ' sex abuse ', ' Sexual abuse ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Clinic ', ' Surgeon ', ' experience ', ' 65+ years old ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Group Affiliation ', ' High Prevalence ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Minority ', ' violent attack ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' combat ', ' evidence base ', ' secondary outcome ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' clinical practice ', ' public health priorities ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' traumatic event ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' Health Care Research ', ' healthcare research ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,SC1,2016,372500,0.1705531561562944
"A CBPR Initiative to Address Obesity Disparities for Latinos in the San Joaquin V DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary Nationwide, Latinos of all age groups disproportionately experience overweight and obesity morbidity and mortality. These disparities are exacerbated in communities with high rates of poverty and limited English proficiency. The eight-county region of the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California is such an area. SJV is represented by one of the highest concentrations of Latinos in the U.S., predominantly of Mexican descent. The region also has among the highest rates of undocumented, immigrant Latino populations which are largely under-represented in research and pose greater challenges in relationship with researchers. Established in 2005, the University of California, Merced (UC Merced) is the first-ever research university in the SJV and one of two Hispanic Serving Institutions in the 10-campus UC system. Since its inception UC Merced has had a strong, formal commitment to improve the well-being of SJV. Since 2006, UC Merced has grown an initiative for Community Engaged Scholarship that has contributed to multiple regional CBPR efforts with a focus on social justice and health equity. These efforts have not well reached the Latino communities in SJV nor have they addressed obesity disparities. The proposed collaboration between UC Merced, Central California Regional Obesity Prevention Program, and several regional community stakeholders will create a formal CBPR initiative to address obesity disparities among Latinos, with a focus on families and multigenerational households (common for Latinos in SJV). Traditional working partnerships, advisory boards, and conference and meeting methods will be blended with emerging CBPR approaches such as Open Space, World Cafes, Photovoice, and social media to establish a strong and sustainable network of action research that is culturally and linguistically appropriate Training and support will aim to improve the capacity of both community and academic partners to work synergistically to establish an action plan to use CBPR to address Latino obesity disparities. Advisory, planning, and action teams will be established with community-academic representatives and across community sectors (e.g.., faith, business, education) and generations. The project will produce sustainable community-academic relationships and infrastructure, and initial proposals for CBPR projects on Latino obesity/overweight disparities in the SJV.

"Development of a Behavioral Activation Mobile App for depressed Latinos ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Treatment for depression is a core health disparity for Latinos in the U.S. Although U.S. Latinos are more likely than non-Hispanic Whites to experience depression (Alegria et al., 2006), U.S. Latinos are less than half as likely as Whites to receive evidence-based care for depression (Lagomasino et al., 2014). Latinos with elevated depressive symptoms are most likely to report such symptoms to primary care physicians (PCPs; Lewis-Fernandez et al., 2005), who in turn typically prescribe antidepressant medication and rarely recommend psychotherapy. This limited recommendation of psychotherapy is problematic because, as compared to Whites, Latinos: 1) are less likely to take antidepressant medication when prescribed (Miranda & Cooper, 2004) and 2) prefer psychotherapy as compared to medication for the treatment of depression (Cooper et al., 2003). Thus, in order to reduce the depression treatment disparity for Latinos, the dissemination of evidence-based therapies for depression via PCPs must be improved.  Mobile technologies, including smartphones and mobile applications (apps) are widely used by Latinos in the U.S. and offer an ideal vehicle for meeting widespread treatment needs. As behavior therapies have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of depression among Latino patients (e.g., Collado et al., 2014), these therapies are natural fits when selecting a treatment to adapt for delivery via a mobile app and recommendation by a PCP. One behavior therapy that is especially appropriate for this group is brief Behavioral Activation (BA; Lejuez et al., 2001; Collado et al., 2014). Considering that Latinos in the U.S. are a heterogenous group, brief BA is an ideal fit because it is idiographic, affords the accommodation of personal values on an individual basis, and can be delivered in Spanish. Moreover, brief BA is appropriate for delivery via a mobile app and for recommendation by a PCP because it is simple, straightforward, and evidence-based.  In this Phase I STTR, we will leverage our previous research in order to develop, test, and refine a Spanish-language mobile app version of brief BA (Apptivación Conductual) in the service of increasing access to evidence-based depression treatment for Latinos. We will conduct a small-scale randomized clinical trial with 40 U.S. Latino adults with limited English proficiency and elevated depressive symptoms referred from local PCPs, who will be randomized to receive either Apptivación Conductual or a CBT-based Spanish- language mobile app (iCouch CBT). Key outcomes include treatment feasibility, acceptability, adherence, and change in depressive symptoms associated with Apptivación Conductual as compared to iCouch CBT. Via product development, testing, and refinement consistent with the STTR Phase I mechanism, we expect to create a marketable product for which we will pursue larger scale clinical testing in an STTR Phase II study.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Depression treatment is a core health disparity for Latinos in the U.S. as U.S. Latinos are more likely than non- Hispanic Whites to experience depression, but are less than half as likely as Whites to receive evidence-based care for depressive symptomatology. Mobile technologies offer an ideal strategy for meeting the widespread depression treatment needs of U.S. Latinos as recent U.S. population-level data suggests that Latinos adopt smartphones at a rate higher than any other demographic group. The purpose of the proposed project is to develop, test, and refine a Spanish-language mobile application version of brief Behavioral Activation, an idiographic, straightforward, empirically supported treatment for elevated depressive symptoms, for referral by primary care physicians in the service of increasing access to evidence-based treatment for depression for Latinos.            ",Development of a Behavioral Activation Mobile App for depressed Latinos,9115018,R41MD010491,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Antidepressants ', ' Antidepressant Drugs ', ' Antidepressant Agent ', ' Antidepressive Agents ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Future ', ' Language ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Shoulder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Beck depression inventory ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' STTR ', ' Small Business Technology Transfer Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' product development ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' mobile application ', ' mobile app ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' symptomatology ', ' ']",NIMHD,"MOUNTAINPASS TECHNOLOGY, LLC",R41,2016,224977,0.013711336078302924
"Enhanced Primary Care Nutrition and Screen time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Primary Care Based Feeding and Screen Time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants Latino children experience higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic white children, a disparity that emerges in infancy. Among Latino children, those with Spanish-speaking parents are at highest risk for obesity. Research has shown that optimal feeding strategies in early life and avoidance of screen time may lower the risk of childhood obesity, which in turn, reduces the risk of obesity and its comorbidities through    adulthood. However, few interventions have sought to promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino parents. In addition, most interventions in the literature that address infant obesity prevention have been conducted through home visits or special trips to the intervention site by parents, approaches that may not be sustainable in low-resource settings due to cost and the burden on participants. Given that infants are expected to have 7 well-child visits in the first year of life, primary care is an ideal setting in which to ofer parental education on infant feeding and screen time recommendations. The overall objective of this proposal is to design, pilot test, and refine a Spanish-language, culturally appropriate, primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in Latino infants born to Spanish-speaking    mothers. Our overarching hypothesis is that focused education on infant feeding and screen time avoidance will lead to use of optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers and result in less weight gain in the first year of life. In preparation for submitting an R01 application to test this hypothesis, we propose research with the following specific aims to be conducted at the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) outpatient pediatric clinic: Aim 1: Use the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to design 5 group educational modules that promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers; Aim 2: Use a pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to test a yearlong intervention in which the 5 modules (Aim 1) are provided to Spanish-speaking Latino mothers just after well-child visits at ages 2 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, and 12 months (primary outcomes will include use of responsive feeding practices, infant dietary intake, and infant active and passive television viewing time; secondary outcomes will be infant anthropometrics); Aim 3: Use qualitative methods to assess how individual components of the intervention from Aim 2 affected feeding and screen time practices. By the conclusion of    this award, we will have a scalable and potentially reproducible intervention for infant feeding and screen time practices, one that is linguistically and culturally appropriate for Spanish-speaking Latino parents and aims to reduce weight gain in the first year of life while promoting habits that protect against obesity across the lifespan. Dr. Amy Beck, PI for this mentored career development award, is a bilingual pediatrician with considerable clinical experience caring for low-income Latino children and a deep commitment to improving health outcomes    in this population. Dr. Beck is a pediatric attending at SFGH (a public hospital affiliated with UCSF that serves a majority Latino population) where she provides both general pediatric care and also is the co-director of the pediatric obesity clinic. With respect to her research background, Dr. Beck holds a MPH and completed a General Pediatrics research fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). During her fellowship, Dr. Beck used both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate risk factors for obesity among Latino children. She has 5 first-author publications, of which 4 directly inform this proposal. She is currently conducting two pilot intervention studies in obesity prevention and treatment for Latino children. Her long-term career goal is to be an independent investigator in the field of obesity prevention with a focus on improving preventive services for low-income Latino children. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Beck must strengthen her skills in biostatistics and qualitative methods and acquire new skills in dietary analysis and RCTs of behavioral interventions. Dr. Beck has formed an    interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors and consultants with expertise in general pediatrics, nutrition, psychology, anthropology, Latino health, pediatric obesity, and health policy. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Cabana, is an internationally respected health services researcher and the Division Chief of General Pediatrics at UCSF. Dr. Cabana has extensive expertise in the design and conduct of RCTs in the ambulatory setting and a strong track record of mentorship. In addition to her mentored research plan and ongoing tutorials with her    diverse mentorship team, Dr. Beck will take advantage of UCSF's numerous opportunities for research training. She will enroll in additional courses offered through the Training in Clinical Research Program that cover specific areas of her career development plan. She will also take a course at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health on dietary assessment. Finally, she will attend seminars offered by the Division of General Pediatrics and participate in the K scholars program offered by the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at UCSF. Dr. Beck has the full support of the UCSF Department of Pediatrics and the Division of General Pediatrics for this proposed award. By the conclusion of this award, Dr. Beck will be well positioned as an    independent investigator in the field of childhood obesity prevention research.    	     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the proposed research are to design and evaluate a low-cost, primary care-based intervention to prevent the onset of obesity in Latino infants. This proposal is relevant to public health because obesity often begins early in life and is associated with diabetes, heart disease, and numerous other comorbidities, and because Latino children in the United States experience disproportionately high rates of obesity. The goal of the proposed intervention is to promote infant feeding, nutrition and screen time practices that will be protective against obesity across the lifespan.    	        ",Enhanced Primary

"Disclosure Preferences of Older Latinos with Advanced Cancer & their Caregivers ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Meeting the communication needs and preferences of advanced cancer patients and their families is central to the delivery of quality care and speaks directly to the mission and programmatic goals of the National Institute of Nursing Research regarding palliative care, health disparities and this specific PA-11-182. However, little is known about the perceptions and preferences of older U.S. Latinos with cancer, one of the fastest growing segments of the older population and their family caregivers regarding the delivery of bad news. Evidence based guidelines regarding the communication of bad news are also limited, particularly for multicultural populations. Not knowing these preferences may hinder effective communication between providers and patients, an established ingredient for improving patient outcomes, as well as the use and quality of palliative care services. Guided by the Andersen, Aday Behavioral Model of Health Services Utilization the primary aim is to examine the association between behavioral, affective, cognitive and macro dimensions of culture and the disclosure and communication preferences of older Latinos with advanced cancer, and whether this association is moderated by key clinical, demographic and psychosocial factors. The study will also compare Latino cancer patients' disclosure preferences to those of their Anglo counterparts, as well as preferences between patients and caregivers in both groups. Survey participants will be 150 (100 Latino and 50 Anglo) older advanced cancer patients (stage 3 or 4 with locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic cancer) and 150 of their family caregivers. Using phenomenological interviews with a subsample of 20 Latino patients and 20 of their family caregivers, the study will explore and describe in-depth Latino patient and caregiver communication preferences regarding the content, style and timing of diagnostic and prognostic information, as well as perceptions and experiences that elucidate the context of their preferences within culture. Finally, the study will assess the concordance between patients' preferences and their self- reported actual experiences when they were first told they had cancer. The study will address critical knowledge gaps in bioethics research related to the tension between the principles of autonomy and beneficence in different cultures. It will be the first to identify the disclosure preferences of Latino patients and families using a unique approach which departs from the conventional notion that autonomy-based preferences are universal. It will also be the first to assess multiple dimensions of Latino culture in the area of health disparities in palliative care using mixed methods. A better understanding of patient and caregiver disclosure preferences will provide crucial information needed for future interventions, evidence-based guidelines, and enhancing vital provider-patient/family communication and care provided to older Latinos with advanced cancer and their families. Findings will also help inform approaches to the return of results to Latino cancer research participants and others with life limiting illnesses in our increasingly diverse, multicultural society.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about the preferences of older U.S. Latinos with advanced cancer and their families regarding the communication of bad news related to their cancer. Not knowing their preferences may prevent good communication between providers and patients and negatively affect important patient outcomes. This study will determine how various dimensions of culture influence the preferences of older Latinos with advanced cancer regarding the communication of information about their diagnosis and prognosis. The study promises to provide crucial information for developing future studies, evidence-based guidelines and improving the palliative care provided to one of our most vulnerable groups, older Latinos with cancer.            ",Disclosure Preferences of Older Latinos with Advanced Cancer & their Caregivers,9149029,R21NR014305,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Benevolence ', ' Beneficence ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Bioethics ', ' Canada ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Elements ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Italy ', ' Latin America ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Portugal ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Research ', ' Societies ', ' Spain ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' prognostic ', ' Distress ', ' European ', ' news ', ' Staging ', ' Metastatic Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Metastatic Cancer ', ' Disseminated Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Country ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Locally Advanced Cancer ', ' Locally Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Hydration ', ' Hydration status ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Recurrent Malignant Tumor ', ' Recurrent Cancer ', ' Recurrent Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cognitive ', ' Older Population ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Behavioral ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Population ', ' Affective ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' Latin American ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health service use ', ' health service utilization ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R21,2016,190429,0.06921193983682432
"Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 proposal is to develop a culturally tailored nutrition communication intervention for primary prevention of breast cancer among bicultural Latinas. The overarching goal of the study is to advance understanding of how communication and acculturation processes influence cancer risk behaviors in order to design effective culturally tailored interventions to reduce cancer risk behaviors. This approach is particularly relevant when considering research on the health of the population of CA's San Joaquin Valley (SJV). A vast, largely rural region that produces over half of the nation's fruit, nuts, and vegetables, SJV is 50% Latino, mostly of Mexican origin6. The SJV has a very diverse Latino population: 25% are foreign-born, and their primary language may be an indigenous Mexican language rather than Spanish, while 75% are native-born U.S. citizens, who possess varied fluency in English abilities and whose families may include both legal and undocumented immigrants. The linguistic and acculturative diversity of this population poses new challenges for understanding how to design effective behavior change interventions. Most community-based interventions with Latinos have focused on those who speak Spanish exclusively, limiting our understanding of how acculturation and linguistic diversity impact communication intervention design and effectiveness. mHealth strategies offer a way of delivering interventions that are not only culturally appropriate for Latinos across the acculturation spectrum, but also appropriate for primary cancer prevention among young adults who are eager adopters of technology. This study aims to fill the knowledge gaps through a research plan designed around three sequential aims employing mixed methods for message testing and community intervention research. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with SJV Latinas (N=25) to explore factors that influence diet and food preparation behaviors as well as barriers and facilitators to the adoption of healthier diets. Results will inform the content categories for message tailoring, the structure of the messages, and the means of dissemination. In Aim 2, we will use the findings from Aim 1 to build and test a library of messages that are culturally appropriate for bicultural Latinas using focus groups and cognitive interviews. Aim 3 is the design, pilot test, and evaluation of an intervention to improve diet behaviors. The intervention consists of a series of culturally appropriate messages, developed in Aim 2, tailored to each participant's needs and preferences, to be disseminated via mobile phone over a 4-week period. We will evaluate preliminary outcomes (e.g., usage and feedback about the intervention and changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions) at four different times. We will determine preliminary estimates of effect size for behavioral outcomes (consumption of dietary fat, fruits and vegetables), based on two post-intervention data collections. We will additionally evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability in order to refine the intervention for a future larger randomized controlled trial, to be proposed in an R01 application before the end of this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The demographic and risk factor profiles for Latinos suggest a looming cancer epidemic: Latinos are younger, poorer, and less likely to have access to cancer screening than the general population. The ""Acculturation Paradox"" further suggests that acculturation is a risk factor for diet-related breast cancer risk. This project aims to improve eating behaviors as a primary cancer prevention strategy, and the emphasis on young adult, bicultural Latinas focuses on those at high preventable cancer risk. The overall goals of this career development grant are to improve understanding of (a) factors that influence Latinas' cancer-related behaviors that may be modifiable through communication-based strategies, and (b) factors that influence Latinas' communication preferences and intervention effectiveness, in order to inform a culturally appropriate mHealth intervention.",Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas,9323648,K01CA190659,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' dietary lipid ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Nuts ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' evaluation/testing ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' mammary tumor prevention ', ' mammary cancer prevention ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Healthy diet ', ' good diet ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Categories ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' food preparation ', ' cancer care ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' reduced food intake ', ' reduced eating ', ' eat less ', ' ethnic identity ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, MERCED",K01,2016,10572,0.023015295420747706
"Community-Based Prevention of Youth Violence in Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent violence is an important public health problem in the US, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Latinos are the fastest-growing racial/ethnic group of children in the US, and are disproportionately affected by youth violence. There is, however, little information on the risk and protective factors that influence Latino youth violence. The overall objective of this proposed NICHD Career Development Award research is to identify risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration. This will be accomplished through three specific aims, which are to: 1) Identify beliefs, attitudes, and norms that influence violence perpetration among Latino adolescents; 2) Identify risk and protective factors in the family, peer, and community contexts that predict violence perpetration in a cohort of Latino youth; and 3) Validate and examine the relative contributions of individual, family, peer, and community factors to violence among Latino adolescents. In Aim 1, focus groups of violent and non-violent Latino adolescents will be conducted to examine risk and protective factors for violence, violence prevention strategies, and components of potentially effective violence prevention interventions. For Aim 2, a secondary data analysis of the National Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) will be conducted using multi-level modeling techniques to determine which contextual factors in adolescence are associated with violence perpetration approximately two years later. The findings from Aims 1 and 2 will be used in Aim 3 to design a survey that concurrently examines individual and contextual factors associated with youth violence, and to test the survey in a large sample of Latino adolescents. Findings from these three studies will provide the foundation for a future Latino youth violence prevention intervention that is culturally tailored, focuses on the major risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence, and is informed by Latino youth. This innovative approach uses multiple methods (qualitative, multi-level longitudinal quantitative, and a survey) to address a significant public health need for improving the knowledge base required to develop successful community-based interventions for Latino youth violence prevention. The proposed award is consistent with the component of the NICHD mission to ensure that all children have the chance to achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives, free from disease or disability. The exceptional resources and institutional support at UT Southwestern, outstanding multi-disciplinary mentorship team, and the proposed career development activities, will allow the candidate to achieve her long-term goal of becoming an independent investigator and nationally recognized expert on community-based interventions effective in reducing and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence. There is an epidemic of youth violence in the US, with 36% of adolescents involved in fighting and 18% in weapon-carrying, and Latinos are disproportionately affected by violence; because youth violence can result in serious injury and homicide, there is an urgent need to identify strategies that can lead to successful violence prevention interventions for Latino youth. The proposed research identifies risk and protective factors for Latino youth violence perpetration using focus groups with Latino youth, multi-level modeling of a longitudinal dataset, and a newly-designed survey administered to Latino youth. Achievement of the study aims has the potential to be a significant contribution to reducing racial/ethnic disparities in youth violence, as the proposed research studies could lead to the development of an effective youth violence prevention intervention for Latinos.",Community-Based Prevention of Youth Violence in Latinos,8989549,K23HD068401,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Belief ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Financial cost ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Homicide ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' violence prevention ', ' prevent violence ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' weapons ', ' tool ', ' fighting ', ' Techniques ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' cohort ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' Community based prevention ', ' peer ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' cultural values ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' teen violence ', ' youth violence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' National Survey of Adolescents ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' effective intervention ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' violence perpetration ', ' adolescent health ', ' ']",NICHD,LUNDQUIST INSTITUTE FOR BIOMEDICAL INNOVATION AT HARBOR-UCLA MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2016,126626,0.0253308250650047
"Mentoring in the Context of Improving Care for Latinos with Diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The exponential growth of the US born and immigrant Latino population over the last two decades in the United States, coupled with the national increase in obesity, has led to an enormous increase in the number of Latino patients with diabetes. Effective care of these patients is often complicated by language barriers, low health literacy, and low patient engagement which all contribute to well-documented disparities in diabetes outcomes. This proposal outlines a 5 year career development plan for the candidate to expand her mentoring work with early career researchers focused on clinical and health services research dedicated to improving diabetes outcomes among low-income Latino patients. In addition to mentoring plans, the proposal outlines three specific aims to a) Identify patient perceptions of barriers and facilitators to accessing language assistance services in diabetes care; b) Explore barriers and facilitators to the establishment of healthy infant feeding habits among low income Latina women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the context of an automated telephone self-management intervention; and c) Develop and formatively evaluate a social marketing campaign aimed at encouraging Latino parents with diabetes to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption in their children aged 3-11. Through the efficient leveraging of existing resources, collaborations, data, and affiliations with NIH-funded networks, the overarching goal of this application is to promote the effective mentorship of early career investigators at all levels of the research training pipeline in Latino diabetes clinical an translational research. The enormous growth of the Latino population with diabetes poses challenges for patients, physicians, and health care systems, particularly when language barriers exist. The proposed funding will support the expanded mentoring of early career investigators--from every level of the training pipeline--in clinical and health services research dedicated to improving outcomes for low-income Latinos with diabetes. It will also support a research project on determining Latino diabetes patients’ role in overcoming language barriers in health care, and two innovative projects aimed at empowering Latino parents with diabetes to decrease diabetes risk in their children.",Mentoring in the Context of Improving Care for Latinos with Diabetes,9039589,K24DK102057,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Infant ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' sugar ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' cohort ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' diabetes risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' TIM1 ', ' P60 ', ' GEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Research Training ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Clinical Services ', ' health literacy ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' feeding ', ' Minority ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' improved outcome ', ' minority investigator ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2016,183864,0.17852528386542948
"A Randomized Clinical Trial Of Culturally Tailored MI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the priority area Treatment for Health Disparities/Special Populations. Epidemiological and psychosocial research indicates that Latinos suffer greater adverse effects from hazardous drinking compared to other racial/ethnic groups, including higher rates of cirrhosis fatality and alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes. Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer alcohol-related health disparities, are less likely to initiate and to remai in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with high density of alcohol outlets. However, research on the field is challenged by the lack of studies comparing tailored to non-tailored treatments. We have pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905) demonstrating that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers. This study will be the basis for the current proposed study, which is a larger scale version of the pilot. The key modification was to incorporate social stressors in the context of acculturation. Thus, in the proposed study, we will also explore acculturation stress as an influence on the relationship between acculturation and alcohol consumption behavior. The public health impact of this study will be to develop a program of early screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous drinking among Latinos in communities that may lack such services. By providing early screening and intervention, we hope to minimize the burden of illness and social consequences that disproportionately affect Latino communities. Study Design: 357 Latino men and women who meet criteria for hazardous drinking (> 5/occasion for men, >4/occasion for women) will be recruited from the community. Following informed consent, they will complete a baseline assessment in either Spanish or English, and will then be randomized to receive either un-tailored motivational intervention (MI) or a culturally-tailored motivational intervention (CTMI). Participant randomization will be balanced by language preference, gender, alcohol severity, acculturation stress, and negative consequences, to ensure there is equivalent representation in each cell. Participants will be contacted by research assistants unaware of treatment assignment at 2, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Primary Aim 1: It is hypothesized that those randomized to receive the tailored treatment will report fewer alcohol- related negative consequences and fewer heavy drinking days at follow-up vs. those randomized to receive the un-tailored treatment. Primary Aim 2: Explore acculturation stress as a moderator of alcohol treatment outcomes. Long term goals: Develop a model of care that is easily disseminated in the community, and to generate theoretically-informed hypotheses to better understand how acculturation stress and processes confer risk for increased drinking among Latinos. We expect that this project will contribute needed knowledge about the role of acculturation stress in alcohol drinking behavior and treatment response. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer a greater burden of alcohol-related health disparities and negative social consequences compared to other racial/ethnic groups, are less likely to initiate and to remain in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with a high density of alcohol outlets. Pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905), which will serve as the basis for the current proposed larger-scale study, demonstrated that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers.

"Association of Acculturation with Type 2 Diabetes Risk Among US Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its long term sequelae are increasing in the US, particularly among Latinos. Latinos are at increased risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and develop T2D at younger ages and at a lower body weight index compared to non-Hispanic whites. For these reasons, Latinos have been identified as a NIDDK priority population with a NIDDK research agenda that includes both biologic, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors that affect T2D prevalence and complications. Acculturation is an important socio-cultural factor that may explain the disproportionate health burden of T2D among Latinos. Acculturation is defined as the process whereby an immigrant culture adopts the beliefs and practices of a host culture. There are limited studies of T2D risk factors and acculturation and how this relationship affects intermediary T2D processes and outcomes such as incident T2D and subclinical cardiovascular disease. The association between acculturation and T2D is inconsistent among Latinos in the published literature. This grant will study the association of acculturation with T2D risk and risk factors using data from multiple well- established epidemiologic NIH cohort studies using validated multidimensional acculturation scales that capture the complex domains of cultural values, beliefs, and behaviors of the acculturation process. The 5 cohorts are: San Antonio Heart Study, Sacramento Latino Study of Aging, Boston Area Community Health Survey, Dallas Heart Study and the Framingham Heart Study Omni Cohort. The simultaneous comparison of findings will maximize the potential for exploring whether the reported heterogeneity of prior study findings is due to differences in underlying Latino cohort characteristics, geographic differences in the process of acculturation in the US and/or differences in the measure of acculturation. Dr. Lopez's long-term goal is to become an independent patient-oriented researcher in diabetes care. Aided by advanced coursework in biostatistics and social epidemiology during the K23 award period, Dr. Lopez will acquire additional research skills and experience under the mentorship of nationally and internationally known researchers in a supportive academic environment. 1 PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Acculturation is an important socio-cultural factor that may explain the disproportionate health burden of type 2 diabetes (T2D) among Latinos. Understanding how acculturation impacts T2D risk factors and outcomes among Latinos will inform how best to tailor lifestyle and behavioral interventions and reduce health disparities. 2",Association of Acculturation with Type 2 Diabetes Risk Among US Latinos,9091506,K23DK098280,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Body Weight ', ' Boston ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Calcium ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heart ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Literature ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Physiology ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' Immigrant ', ' apM1 (adipose-specific) protein ', ' apM-1 protein ', ' adipocyte, C1q and collagen domain containing protein ', ' adipocyte complement-related protein 30-kDa ', ' ACRP30 protein ', ' adiponectin ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Visceral ', ' subcutaneous ', ' waist circumference ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' cultural values ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' diabetes risk ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' adipokines ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' obesity risk ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' Framingham Heart Study ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' fasting glucose ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2016,179274,0.1251277926056329
"Bilingualism and Resilience in Latino Youth DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino adolescents have among the highest rates of functionally impairing depressive symptoms, including the highest rates of suicidal behavior. A significant and growing percentage of Latino youth live in poverty, which further increases their risk for depressive symptoms. Although coping skills programs have proven beneficial for preventing or reducing risk for depressive symptoms, low-socioeconomic status (low-SES) Latino youth have among the lowest rates of utilization of conventional mental health services, greatly limiting the effectiveness of these coping programs for this population. Thus, these youth could benefit from alternative approaches to prevention and intervention. A key first step in improving prevention efforts involves the identification of indigenous, accessible, and culturally acceptable processes that support coping and reduce risk for depressive symptoms. Bilingual language development is one such factor that is highly prevalent, but occurs at varying levels of exposure, usage, and proficiency, in low-SES Latino youth. Bilingualism supports the development of executive function (EF), and higher EF has been linked to more adaptive coping and lower levels of depressive symptoms. However, no research has examined associations between bilingualism and depressive symptoms in Latino youth. Therefore, the purpose of the current R03 is to examine the link between degree of bilingualism and the development of depressive symptoms, as well as the potential mediators (EF and coping) of this link, in a sample of low-SES Latino adolescents. We will assess degree of bilingualism, EF, coping and depressive symptoms at baseline and 12 months later in 80 bilingual Latino youth ages 10-13 years old. We focus on this age range because levels of depressive symptoms spike by middle adolescence, making early adolescence a crucial period for prevention and early intervention. Assessments will include youth and parent reports of all variables as well as testing of youth language proficiency and EF. The Specific Aims of the proposed project are to 1) determine the prospective association between degree of bilingualism and development of depressive symptoms over one year in low-SES Latino youth, and 2) assess executive function and coping as potential mediators of the association between bilingualism and development of depressive symptoms over one year. The successful completion of this project will lead to a multi-wave, multi-site R01 proposal to identify pathways from bilingual language development to mental health outcomes in a diverse population of youth. The long-term goal of this line of research is to reduce disparities in depressive symptoms and their health consequences affecting low-SES Latino adolescents and similar high-risk, underserved youth populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latino adolescents experience disproportionate rates of depressive symptoms and related negative health consequences, including suicidal behavior. Conventional mental health services lack effectiveness for preventing and reducing risk for depressive symptoms in Latino youth. Identifying indigenous, accessible, and culturally acceptable developmental processes that support mental health, such as bilingualism, will improve prevention efforts for this high-risk, underserved population.",Bilingualism and Resilience in Latino Youth,9093231,R03HD087648,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Due Process ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Maintenance ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Parents ', ' Population Programs ', ' Poverty ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Vocabulary Words ', ' Vocabulary ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Link ', ' Early Intervention ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' suicidal ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Early identification ', ' Sampling ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Indigenous ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' suicide behavior ', ' suicidal behavior ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' thirteen year old ', ' age 13 years ', ' 13 year old ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' critical period ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adolescence ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2016,73347,0.03427716322500512
"The Primary Care Medical Home and Preventive Service Use in Latino Immigrants DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CANDIDATE: I am proposing to study how certain features of the Primary Care Medical Home (PCMH) impact the utilization of recommended preventive health services by Latino Immigrants. I will build upon my broad clinical and health policy background, using expert mentors and local research training opportunities to develop into an independent health services researcher. RESEARCH FOCUS: Latino immigrants, a rapidly growing segment of our population, underutilize routine preventive health care. Some features of the PCMH have been associated with increased utilization in some vulnerable populations, but little objective, multi-facility data exists to address the effects of these changs on Latino immigrants. The Oregon Community Health Information Network (OCHIN) is a multiple-facility linked electronic medical record that contains data capable of filling this knowledge gap. This proposal expands on existing PCMH research, and proposes to use the OCHIN Electronic Health Record (EHR) data to evaluate the association between certain PCMH principles and preventive service use in Latino immigrants. TRAINING GOALS: My training goals include (1) developing his skills in research design, analysis, and interpretation with a focus on the use of large databases to study vulnerable populations and 2) expanding my knowledge and experience in the strategies for and practice of health disparities research. ENVIRONMENT: I will undergo his career development in the Department of Family Medicine at Oregon Health Science University and through the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute, two organizations with significant and longstanding resources for early-career researchers. METHODS: (1) Cross-sectional analysis of Latino immigrants in the OCHIN EHR data and their rates of utilization of lipid screening, cervical cancer screening, and pneumococcal vaccination. (2) Retrospective cohort analysis of the association between certain features of the PCMH and these preventive services in Latino immigrants. OUTCOMES: I will measure the rates of preventive service use in Latino immigrants cared for in OCHIN clinics and compare these to rates of other populations in OCHIN. I will test how select features of the PCMH will affect the rate of utilization of lipid screening, cervical cancer screening, and pneumococcal vaccination in Latino immigrants. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will provide valuable information for medical providers and policy makers as they attempt to finance, organize, and provide routine preventive health care for low-income individuals in our communities. Specifically, our community health centers will benefit from this information as they provide preventive health care with limited resources.",The Primary Care Medical Home and Preventive Service Use in Latino Immigrants,9079420,K08HS021522,[''],AHRQ,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,K08,2016,145819,0.0860180805166374
"Diet quality and cardiometabolic disparities among Latino ethnic subgroups DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal for this application for a NHLBI-K01 Faculty Diversity Mentored Career Development Award is to provide the candidate, Josiemer Mattei, PhD, MPH, with indispensable training to become an independent researcher in nutrition and cardio-metabolic disparities in Latinos, through epidemiological and intervention projects. These have been constructed along a comprehensive training program facilitated by a team of expert mentors in nutritional epidemiology, cardiovascular health, and community interventions.  Responding to the staggering prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic disease in Latinos living in the United States (US), and to the limited studies on the dietary habits and cultural beliefs that may contribute to those disparities, the research aims are to (1) to identify diet quality indices within Latino ethnic subgroups in the US and to evaluate associations of such indices with traditional and emerging CVD risk factors within ethnicity, (2) to contrast diet quality of Puerto Ricans in the mainland US versus the island, and assess how it is associated with long-term cardio-metabolic factors; and (3) to assess deep-cultural factors (core beliefs and influences) related to diet and disease and determine efficacy of a pilot intervention based on such components for Latino subgroups on improving diet quality. Analyses for the first two aims will be conducted using data from the national Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study, and the San Juan Obese Adult Longitudinal Study in Puerto Rico. Latino multiethnic adults will be recruited for the mixed-methods formative and pilot studies to be conducted at the South End Community Health Center in Boston, MA. To match the scope of the proposed scientific work, this proposal includes five career-development and training areas: (1) research expertise through the proposed aims, (2) coursework in advanced epidemiological methods, and behavioral and community intervention methods, (3) multiple career-building activities to acquire essential tools for leadership and professional growth, as well as dissemination and translation of findings, (4) continued mentoring and monitoring by an outstanding team of senior mentors and an advisory committee; and (5) a detailed plan to expand grant support and collaborations with various national institutions. This K01 project will compellingly impact public health by bridging the gap in knowledge of traditional diet quality of specific Latino groups and how these may shape racial and ethnic disparities in CVD risk factors. The work will provide preliminary data to support longitudinal studies on diet and disease, and full-scale community trials on improving diet quality to reduce disease burden among Latinos. The project builds upon exceptional resources and mentoring at the candidate's institution (Harvard School of Public Health) and partnering organizations, to train her in key new areas, bolster applications for competitive funding, disseminate findings among researchers and the wider community, augment faculty diversity, and attain research independence.  (End of Abstract) NARRATIVE Latinos, the largest minority group in the United States, have an extremely high prevalence of cardio-metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Nutritional strategies could help lower that burden, yet few data exist on the quality of the traditional diets of specific Latino subgroups in the US and their effect on risk of cardio-metabolic diseases, or on which cultural aspects of diet and disease may enhance community- based dietary interventions for Latinos. This proposal aims to bridge that gap by utilizing existing US Latino cohorts with robust data on diet and CVD risk factors to examine ethnic-specific association of diet quality with cardio-metabolic risk factors, and then apply those observational results into a pilot intervention culturally tailored for Latino ethnic subgroups to improve their diet quality.",Diet quality and cardiometabolic

"Reducing Barriers to Autism Care in Latino Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Early Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) diagnosis improves long-term child development and families' ability to cope with this disorder. Latino children are diagnosed with ASDs at older ages and at the point of more severe symptoms, putting them and their families at significant disadvantage. Interventions addressing family, community, and health care systems factors hold promise for improving access to ASD diagnostic services for minority children. The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to reduce ethnic differences in ASD care among Latinos. To accomplish this goal, we will develop a survey of 350 Latino parents of either typically-developing children or children with ASDs, to assess common beliefs about autism in Latino communities, and to assess which community factors, health beliefs, and health care system factors are associated with delays in ASD diagnosis. The survey will be conducted at three sites within the Autism Treatment Network: Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon; University of Colorado/The Children's Hospital in Denver; and University of Pennsylvania/Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Based on the barriers found in the survey, we will develop a pilot community-based patient navigator intervention designed to reduce barriers to care. This research will be incorporated into a career development plan that includes increasing the Principal Investigator's knowledge and skills in the areas of autism diagnosis and treatment, mental health disparities, interventional study design, and community-based research. The results of this research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and used as the basis for an NIH-funded proposal to conduct a multi-site test of the intervention designed in this project. Over 120,000 U.S. Latino children have been diagnosed with an ASD, a figure that likely underestimates the true prevalence. This project will help such children achieve earlier diagnosis and better long-term prognosis. The goal of this project is to develop an evidence-based intervention to improve rates of early diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders in Latino children. We will achieve this goal through surveying Latino parents to identify barriers to care and then developing a pilot patient navigator intervention designed to reduce the barriers that we identified.

"Trauma-Informed Prevention to Address Violence and Related Disparities for Latino Youth Project Summary This project uses Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), and community health workers (promotoras) and youth mentors as prevention program facilitators, to address health disparities related to violence exposure among Latino youth. An important objective of the proposal is to address a significant gap in prevention science and health disparities research, by piloting a multi-level family-focused intervention which uses a low cost, culturally attentive, parent-youth engagement strategy focused on adapting an empirically supported Latina parent training program, and incorporating a trauma-informed approach to prevent violence and related health disparities among Latino youth. The specific aims are to: (1) Combine effective prevention programs to gain potential additive/multiplicative effects of serving both parents and youth using a trauma- informed, culturally appropriate, low cost approach; (2) Evaluate program feasibility and acceptability; and (3) Evaluate program effects. To accomplish these aims, we will build upon and strengthen existing collaborations with academic, community-based organizations, and community members, that we have developed during our Phase 1 planning grant. We will continue to use a CBPR approach to build upon community strengths and existing resources, increase engagement and participation, facilitate the reciprocal exchange of knowledge and understanding, and empower community members to engage in social change that improves their lives. Project activities will be implemented under the guidance of a Community Advisory Board, and a network of promotoras who will inform adaptations to the program using a reciprocal and iterative process. A controlled pilot will be used to evaluate the program. Weekly satisfaction ratings, attrition, and attendance will help to assess feasibility and acceptability of the program. Trajectories towards externalizing and internalizing disorders, along with improvements in positive parenting skills, family functioning, youth resilience, deviant peer associations, and youth coping self-efficacy will be examined. Discerning the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and ultimately the uptake of this prevention approach will serve as the foundation to launch a larger prevention trial. This project provides a unique opportunity, with deeply invested Latino and Latino- serving community partners, to advance the field in addressing health disparities, and may well have significant scientific implications for the prevention and treatment of trauma and violence among Latino youth. Project Narrative Violence exposure poses a major problem for Latino youth in the United States. Violence exposure and its negative health and mental health sequelae represent a racial disparity, occurring at disproportionately higher rates among Latino youth when compared with their non-Hispanic White counterparts. An important objective of the proposal is to address a significant gap in prevention science and health disparities research, by utilizing community-based participatory research to develop and pilot a low cost, culturally attentive, parent-youth engagement strategy facilitated by promotoras and youth mentors. Using a trauma-informed, restorative approach, we aim to prevent youth violence and reduce the prevalence of subsequent problem outcomes associated with violence exposure that pose a significant public health burden for Latino youth.",Trauma-Informed Prevention to Address Violence and Related Disparities for Latino Youth,9186384,R03HD089465,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Program Acceptability ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' violence prevention ', ' prevent violence ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Phase ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' 6-11 years old ', ' middle childhood ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' deviancy ', ' deviant ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' cost ', ' resilience ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Trauma ', ' community organizations ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' youth violence prevention ', ' prevent youth violence ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Prevention trial ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' social media ', ' family support ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SANTA BARBARA,R03,2016,108170,0.047465711681058294
"Tailoring of Childhood Obesity Screening and Counseling for Latino Families with Preschool-Aged Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application for a K23 award for a fellowship trained pediatrician specializing in Pediatric Nutrition and childhood obesity. The candidate is committed to an academic career as a physician scientist conducting patient-oriented research in childhood obesity. This award will support the candidate's training and attainment of expertise in three areas: qualitative research methods, cultural tailoring of technology-based interventions, and implementation science. This training will support his overall goals of designing and rigorously testing childhood obesity interventions that can be readily translated and disseminated and that will provide critical insight for care in diverse settings and patient groups. To achieve these goals, Dr. Haemer has assembled a cross-disciplinary mentoring team, each with outstanding experience in research methods and strong records of successful mentoring: Dr. Glasgow, a behavioral scientist who is renown within the field of implementation science; Dr. Bull, an expert researcher in technology-based health promotion; and Dr. Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition specialist with extensive research and clinical experience in childhood obesity and with a long history of mentoring young investigators. The proposed research addresses the huge knowledge gap in cost-effective ways for the healthcare system to influence both patient-level and population-level outcomes for childhood obesity. Evidence-based approaches of surveillance, screening, prevention and treatment largely remain uncertain or untested, especially for the youngest children from groups at highest risk of obesity-related health disparity. This K23 award will study methods for prevention and treatment applied to Latino preschool-aged children from low- income families. The research will test the central hypothesis that culturally tailored screening and counseling will be more effective at decreasing BMI trajectory than usual care. Specific aims include: 1. To characterize components of primary care interactions that should be culturally tailored to enhance motivation for healthy lifestyle change among Latino parents with preschoolers 2. To design a technology-user interface that maximizes acceptance by Latino parents of young children. 3. To pilot test a technology-supported screening and counseling protocol tailored to Latino parents using findings of Aims 1 and 2. Using an implementation science perspective, we will assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation fidelity, and sustainable maintenance of the intervention in clinical practice during the pilot RCT. This research and training will form the basis for an RO1 proposal to test technology-supported childhood obesity prevention and treatment interventions targeting young children from low-income Latino families.

"Sun Protection Barriers and Facilitators Scale (SP-BFS) for Latinos ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although skin cancer (SC) is a largely preventable disease, it is the most common cancer in the United States. More than 3 million skin cancers are diagnosed annually. The lifetime risk of developing melanoma (an aggressive form of skin cancer) is higher among whites, but this disease is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in the Latino population. Compared with whites, Latinos have lower 5-year melanoma survival rates, especially among men (76.6% in Latinos vs. 87.0% in whites). The Latino population often presents late-stage melanoma tumors, which can cause detrimental prognoses. Many of the cases of SC that are diagnosed annually could be prevented by protecting the skin from excessive sun exposure. Latinos tend to report a lower frequency of sunscreen use, and to endorse more sun protection barriers. This group is more likely to believe that not much can be done to decrease the risk of SC and to agree that there are too many recommendation about preventing SC ""that it's hard to know which ones to follow"" when compared with whites. The long-term goal is to use a strong psychosocial measure on sun protection beliefs that can be used to better understand behavior and guide intervention development. The objective of this particular application is to apply a mixed methods approach to better assess psychosocial factors of sun protection in the Latino population, using the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the PEN-3 model of cultural influence as theoretical frameworks. The approach is innovative because it will develop a culturally sensitive, theory-based, and psychometrically strong measure of sun protection barriers and facilitators in English to assess sun protection beliefs in Latinos. In Aim 1, in-depth interviews will be conducted to collect qualitative and quantitative data using a sample of Latino adults (N=30) to create a pool of items reflecting sun protection barriers and facilitators. A cognitive interviewing session will follow u the first set of in-depth interviews (N=15), and the Sun Protection Barriers and Facilitators Scale (SP-BFS) will be developed based on information gathered in this aim. In Aim 2, the scale will be administered to a second sample of Latino adults (N=200) and it will be psychometrically examined (reliability and validity). The proposed research is significant because it will contribut to the limited literature regarding predictors of SC prevention in Latinos as a way to investigate mechanisms to improve health promotion actions. The proposed research supports NCI's goal to identify and understand factors that contribute to disparities in the incidence and mortality of cancer, and for research to help develop appropriate initiatives that are culturally relevant.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At the conclusion of the award, we will have fulfilled the essential public health need for a culturally sensitive, psychometrically strong sun protection barriers and facilitators scale (SP- BFS). This scale will allow us to measure psychosocial factors that might predict and influence the likelihood to engage in sun protective behaviors in the Latino population. The information gained by the development of this scale will improve the assessment, development, and informed dissemination of prevention and control efforts for the decrease of skin cancer morbidity and mortality disparities.            ",Sun Protection Barriers and Facilitators Scale (SP-BFS) for Latinos,9022120,R03CA195039,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' melanoma ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Perception ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Protective Clothing ', ' Psychometrics ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Sunbathing ', ' Sunscreens ', ' Sunblock ', ' Sunscreening Agents ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Ulcer ', ' Ulceration ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Cutaneous Melanoma ', ' Melanoma Skin ', ' Malignant Melanoma of Skin ', ' Malignant Cutaneous Melanoma ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Dermatologist ', ' Prevent skin cancer ', ' skin cancer prevention ', ' Tanning ', ' Skin tanning ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Staging ', ' sun ', ' The Sun ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' information gathering ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Skin ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cognitive ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' sun protection ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' protective behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R03,2016,84750,0.18282726256776607
"Innovative Physical Activity Interventions for Overweight Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the US and are disproportionately impacted by chronic conditions (e.g., overweight/obesity, diabetes) that can be mitigated by physical activity. While evidence-based programs are available to improve physical activity, dissemination is constrained by reliance on costly, limited resources. Short message service (SMS or text messaging) has strong potential as an intervention medium for Latinos, as they are dominant users of mobile phones and text messaging, including those with limited literacy and computer skills. We propose to develop a personalized, culturally-congruent and interactive SMS program to promote the adoption and maintenance of physical activity for overweight, underactive Latino adults and test it for comparable efficacy to an evidence-based telephone-based advising program that has been used successfully with Latinos. Grounded in Social Cognitive and Self-Determination Theories, both programs will include a core set of self-regulatory skill building, social support, and autonomous motivation enhancement, and will be tailored for cultural, linguistic and literacy appropriateness. Randomized at the individual level, 376 sedentary, overweight Latinos ages 45 years and older will be assigned to one of three arms: the SMS- delivered physical activity program, the Human-delivered physical activity program, or an attention-control arm of SMS-delivered basic healthful nutrition advice. They will receive their assigned program for 12 months, and then will be followed for a 6-month maintenance phase, with a final assessment at 18 months. Analyses will determine if the two physical activity programs result in equivalent efficacy in adoption and maintenance of clinically meaningful physical activity increases, and superiority over the attention-control arm at 12 and 18 months. The two physical activity interventions will also be compared for equivalency in prevention of weight gain and reduction in abdominal adiposity. We will explore the relative costs of the programs to determine which program increases physical activity for a lower cost. While health promotion programs delivered by professional staff may be more expensive than those delivered electronically, it is unclear if the automated version can produce more cost-efficient outcomes (i.e., comparable improvements in outcomes for significantly reduced cost). This study will determine if SMS is equivalent in efficacy to the traditional human-delivery channel in increasing physical activity and preventing weight gain, and if it results in a more cost-efficient program. If achieved, this research can significantly reduce health disparities associated with physical activity for Latinos by providing an efficacious tailored and culturally appropriate program poised for widespread dissemination and rapid uptake. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there has been a surge of electronic and mobile health promotion programs to increase regular physical activity (a key health behavior linked with the prevention and control of obesity and Type II Diabetes), few have been adapted to meet the needs and preferences of midlife and older Latinos. This research aims to investigate the effectiveness of an automated Simple Message Service (SMS, also known as text messaging) advisor system relative to a proven human advisor program to promote regular, sustained physical activity among inactive, overweight Latinos. The SMS Advisor program represents a potentially lower-cost and high yield alternative to person-delivered health promotion programs that could be more rapidly disseminated with greater and faster uptake.",Innovative Physical Activity Interventions for Overweight Latinos,9133367,R01DK102016,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Automation ', ' Body Weight ', ' Communication ', ' Computer Literacy ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' literacy ', ' Maintenance ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Proverb ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Determination ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Latino ', ' Schedule ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' sedentary ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' waist circumference ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Adherence ', ' Media Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Text ', ' abdominal adiposity ', ' abdominal fat ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' health literacy ', ' weight gain prevention ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' computerized ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based program ', ' comparative ', ' computer generated ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' social anxiety ', ' family support ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' vigorous intensity ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,653977,0.05119950191441935
"Center for Substance Use and HIV/AIDS Research on Latinos in the United States     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino population has experienced a dramatic increase over the past decade, making it the largest minority group in the United States (US). Along with this surge in numbers Latinos also face greater challenges in accessing health care compared to the general population. These health disparities, which are particularly salient among Latina women, make it imperative to develop a clear understanding of the factors that affect the disproportionate numbers of people suffering from HIV/AIDS and substance abuse in this population. Our long term goal is therefore to contribute to the reduction, prevention, and eventual elimination of HIV/AIDS and substance abuse health disparities among Latinos. The proposed Center will expand on the activities of our current P-20 NIMHD C-SALUD located at Florida International University (FlU). C-SALUD will focus its research, training, and community collaboration activities with Latinos in Miami-Dade County, a county that not only houses a high concentration of Latinos but also has the dubious distinction of having one of the highest rates of HIV, cocaine related deaths, and emergency room admissions in the U.S. The proposed continuing C-SALUD will build on ongoing collaborations with community based organizations which have a longstanding history of providing health and social services to Latinos at risk for HIV and substance abuse as well as other underserved Latino populations in South Florida. The Center will be organized around four cores: Administrative, Research, Research Education /Training, and Community Partnership/Engagement. The target population will be Latinos, particularly Latina women residing in Miami-Dade County with a focus on Latina farm workers ages 18 and older and recent Latina immigrants who have lived in the U.S. less than one year, ages 18-23. These two Latino subgroups are at high risk for HIV and have been impacted by the HIV epidemic. We anticipate that partnerships between C-SALUD researchers and the Miami-Dade County Latino community, will lead to the development of new collaborative strategies for researchers, CBOs, and the Latino community at large to work together more effectively in reducing and eliminating HIV and substance abuse health disparities among Latinos.             The Center is expected to enhance our understanding of the role that social and cultural determinants of health have on the substance abuse and HIV risk behaviors of Latinos, particular Latinas. This knowledge is expected to lead to the development and refinement of culturally relevant and evidence-based HIV prevention strategies available to HIV-uninfected/infected individuals and users of

"Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Underserved Communities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Aging Latino Communities BACKGROUND: Aging Latino adults suffer disproportionately from a number of chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity) improved by increased physical activities (PA) such as walking. Due to language, education, computer, and health literacy barriers, older Latino adults often cannot readily access typical health promotion programs offered in-person or online in U.S. communities. Lay health advisors (""promoters"" in Spanish) offer a nationally recognized, culturally tailored and cost-efficient health behavior change model for Latino communities. However, as with all ""human"" delivered health programs, they impose constraints on participant schedules, and, even with careful intervention fidelity procedures in place, some variability in program delivery across advisors is inevitable. Computer-based culturally tailored physical activity advisor programs can potentially reduce human- to-human scheduling and fidelity constraints and extend program reach. In a recently completed 4- month experiment, a computer-based bilingual Virtual Advisor with touch-screen interactivity (no keyboard or mouse needed) was housed in a community center and programmed to tailor PA advice to the needs and preferences of low-income, aging Latino adults. The Virtual Advisor program successfully increased regular walking levels in participants compared to a health education control. OBJECTIVE: The primary study aim is to conduct a comparative effectiveness trial evaluating the 12- month impacts of the community-based Virtual Advisor PA program relative to a proven Lay Advisor program in a broader population of aging Latino adults. The secondary aim is to determine the comparative cost effectiveness of the Virtual vs. Lay Advisor programs. DESIGN: The 12-month randomized trial will enroll inactive Latino adults ages 55 years and older living near 16 neighborhood community centers (n=265/arm; 530 total). The primary outcome is minutes of walking per week, and additional outcomes of interest include BMI, sedentary behavior, functional performance, and health- related quality of life. Additional areas of investigation are to evaluate theoretically based and empirically supported moderators and mediators of intervention success and determine the potential generalizability of the interventions. IMPACT: The study seeks to demonstrate that a computer-based Virtual Advisor tailored to the needs of aging Latino adults can provide an effective and potentially cost-efficien alternative to Lay Advisors in community settings frequented by this population. The potential extended reach of such programs for use in a range of community settings (e.g., clinics, pharmacies, libraries) provides substantial promise for positively impacting the current health disparities gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there has been an explosion of computerized health promotion programs to increase regular physical activity-a key health behavior linked with the prevention and control of our nation's major killers--few have been adapted to the needs and preferences of low-income Latino adults. This research aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a computer-based 'virtual lay advisor' relative to a proven human lay advisor program-both delivered at local community centers--in promoting regular walking among inactive midlife and older Latino adults. The Virtual Advisor program represents a potentially low-cost alternative to person-delivered health promotion programs that could be translated for use in a range of community settings (e.g., clinics, pharmacies, libraries).",Virtual Advisors for Physical Activity Promotion in Underserved Communities,9109011,R01HL116448,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Behavior ', ' Be element ', ' Beryllium ', ' Communities ', ' Computers ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Counseling ', ' Cues ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Explosion ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' literacy ', ' Literature ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Technology ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Walking ', ' Latino ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Schedule ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Trust ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Prevention ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Older Population ', ' health literacy ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' health related quality of life ', ' monetary value ', ' economic value ', ' virtual ', ' computerized ', ' touchscreen panel ', ' touch screen panel ', ' touch screen ', ' touch panel ', ' touchscreen ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Health behavior change ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' comparative ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' natural language ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' community center ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' ']",NHLBI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,719095,0.0774292805521725
"Physical Activity in Latino Men Through Tailoring: Hombres Saludables ABSTRACT Physical inactivity is a physical inactivity than risk factor for many important chronic diseases. Latino men report higher rates of non-Latinos, are less likely to meet PA guidelines and are disproportionately affected by PA-related health conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. Most Latino PA interventions have focused on women; the vast majority excluded men and none specifically targeted men. Moreover interventions that included men focused mostly on Mexican American only. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective PA interventions with diverse populations of Latino men. NIH has specifically called for research studies to focus on the development and testing of culturally appropriate health-promoting interventions to reduce health disparities among racially and ethnically diverse men. Our research team has 25 years of experience developing, implementing and evaluating individually tailored, theory-based, computer-driven PA interventions including `Seamos Saludables' (in RI) and `Pasos' (in CA), culturally and linguistically adapted, individually- tailored print (Seamos) and web-based (Pasos) interventions for a diverse population of sedentary Latina women that were successful in increasing PA in Latina women. We then conducted formative interviews with Latino men, which confirmed that an intervention would be well-received by them. However, substantial content modifications were needed, so we adapted the print intervention and tested it in a demonstration trial with 10 Mexican American men. After 12 weeks, participants reported a significant increase (p=.03) in mean minutes of PA from 1.50 min/week at baseline to 125.70 min/week at 12 weeks with 100% retention and expressed enthusiasm for the program. However, less than half of the men achieved the PA guidelines of 150 minutes/week. Thus, further enhancements appear to be needed. Follow-up interviews indicated that the intervention was well received, but the men felt that they needed greater accountability, more contact with staff and other participants, briefer and more frequent information, more updates on PA opportunities, and ideas for addressing environmental barriers. The men specifically mentioned interest in web and/or text-based interventions to meet these needs. Thus, we will conduct formative research with a diverse population of Latino men in RI to inform the adaptation of the Pasos web-based intervention that was developed for Latina women, enhance it with new cell phone/text-based intervention components, and ensure that it is culturally appropriate for Latino men of Caribbean, South and Central American origin. We will then conduct a pilot study to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy with a diverse population of Latino men in RI. In the pilot study, we will also explore potential moderators of treatment effects including demographics, acculturation, and environmental variables such as the neighborhood built, social and economic environments. The results of this pilot study will inform a future randomized controlled trial with Latino men to increase PA. Public Health Relevance Latino men report particularly low rates of physical activity (PA) and are disproportionately burdened by health conditions related to sedentary lifestyle. The proposed research will build on a series of previous successful studies to develop an individually tailored intervention using a combination of web and texting that is culturally and linguistically appropriate for a diverse population of Latino men and addresses their PA barriers and preferences. We will conduct focus groups with a diverse population of Latino men to ensure that the intervention is culturally appropriate for Latino men of Caribbean, South and Central American origin and to adapt/develop the new intervention components. Then we will evaluate the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in a pilot study with 50 diverse Latino men.",Physical Activity in Latino Men Through Tailoring: Hombres Saludables,9182483,R34HL128067,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Perception ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Printing ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Accountability ', ' Gender ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sedentary ', ' Series ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Central American ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' programs ', ' South American ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Participant ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Update ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' treatment effect ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' arm ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R34,2016,307603,0.033228369510563946
"Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diabetes incurs the most expensive annual chronic disease-related health care costs and certain ethnic groups, such as Latinos, are disproportionately affected by the burden of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Patients with T2DM also have comorbid chronic conditions that create complexities for proper management, and have implications for future research on integrating primary and behavioral care, particularly in dis- advantaged groups. Cost-effective, sustainable, and patient-centered adaptations of evidence-based approaches to chronic disease management are needed to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, low- resource communities. Integrated Health Care is the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians working together with patients and using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. This care may address mental health conditions, health behaviors, life stressors and crises, and clinical outcomes. Care integration is a cornerstone of effective integrated health care that leads to improved clinical and quality of life outcomes and reduces health-care costs and hospitalizations, especially in vulnerable populations. The goal of this project is to improve integrated care services at a federally-qualified Community Health Center (CHC). Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D), is a randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of an integrated behavioral health and primary cae chronic care disease management intervention for low income T2DM Latino patients with 2 or more chronic conditions accessing care within San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC). The study aims are to: 1) improve glycemic control, 2) improve cardiovascular risk profiles, 3) decrease psychological distress, and 4) evaluate the patient and provider acceptability and sustainability of the program. LUNA-D will recruit 414 non-insulin using adult T2DM patients with 2 or more chronic diseases. Half will be randomized to the Special Intervention (SI) and half to Usual Care (UC). The SI is a 3-month intensive intervention including fully integrated clinical visits with a mid-level provider (MLP) co-located with a behavioral health counselor (BHC) and peer-led evidence-based group health education sessions and proactive care coordination. Following the intense intervention period, the SI will receive booster sessions and fully integrated MLP/BHC clinical visits across 9 additional months. Usual Care is represented by passive appointments with the primary care physician and passive referrals to behavioral health and traditional health education. HbA1C measurements will be taken at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months to detect changes in glycemic control. Clinical lab measures, medication adherence, weight, health behaviors and psychosocial measures will also be obtained across the study. Demonstration of clinical improvement will support adoption by the SYHC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D) study, will conduct research that aims to reduce chronic disease disparities for disadvantaged Latino populations along the California-Mexico border region of the United States.

"Detection, Understanding and Reduction of Latino Health Care Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although Latinos represent one of the fastest-growing populations entering substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, they are the most likely to lack health insurance and receive disparate care in terms of treatment access, quality, and outcomes. In particular, Mexican Americans represent the largest population of uninsured and critically underserved ethnic minority individuals in the United States. As such, it is not surprisng that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and other federal institutions have called for systematic collection of health care data on specific Latino subgroups10 to define vulnerable subpopulations, identify determinants of disparities, and prepare the health care system to develop solutions to promote health equities. The lack of representative datasets with an adequate number of Mexican Americans and information on provider quality of care to accurately explore and identify health care disparities has represented a key barrier to greater knowledge regarding strategies to improve Mexican Americans' treatment outcomes.5 Thus, using a multilevel and multiyear dataset, which includes data collected from 101 outpatient SUD treatment programs and 14,610 clients in 2011 and 2013, we will seek to detect IOM-defined disparities in terms of client achievement of 30- day sobriety at successful treatment completion. Guided by Kilbourne, Switzer, Hyman, Crowley-Matoka, and Fine's (2006) conceptual framework for advancing health disparities research, and consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) conceptual framework for public health,15 we will examine these disparities at both the individual and program level. Aim 1 will focus on detection of treatment disparities between Mexican-Americans and non-Latino Whites and Aim 2 will focus on understanding the extent to which key organizational factors (e.g., acceptance of public insurance, delivery of evidence-based treatment [EBT], and delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate services [CLAS]) may help in the reduction of these treatment disparities. Aim 3 seeks to expand upon the NICE conceptual framework by testing the extent to which increases in programs' acceptance of public insurance (i.e., Medicaid), which will expand as part of the ACA and mostly affect Latinos in Los Angeles County, may lead to improvements in quality of care (i.e., delivery of EBT and CLAS). The proposed analysis of existing data represents a timely and cost-efficient opportunity to have a large overall impact on Latino health care disparities research and policy, especially given the innovative aspect of the proposed research is to detect, understand and reduce client- and program- level disparities for Mexican Americans, who constitute the largest Latino subgroup in the United States. Finally, given the increasing focus on health care reform and its consequences (both positive and negative), the proposed study is believed to have the potential for high overall impact because it will be one of the first known studies to examine the extent to which increases in acceptance of public health insurance, which is a key component of the ACA, lead to increases in quality of care in community-based SUD treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine has called for the examination of Latino subgroups in order to identify vulnerable subpopulations (e.g., Mexican Americans), as well as to better understand the causes of important disparities in health care and inform interventions to reduce such disparities. Thus, this study is of high public health relevance given it will provide federal and state insurance administrators, policy makers, and community-based substance abuse treatment providers with new and critical information to help promote health equities for the most uninsured and critically underserved ethnic minority subpopulation in the United States (i.e., Mexican Americans).","Detection, Understanding and Reduction of Latino Health Care Disparities",9142310,R01DA038608,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' intervention program ', ' treatment program ', ' sober ', ' sobriety ', ' research in practice ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Policy Research ', ' Subgroup ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' health equity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2016,244665,0.0589783291223302

"A Longitudinal Analysis of Acculturation Differences between Immigrant Latino Parents and Youth: Implications on Family Functioning and Youth Development ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children of Latino-origin immigrants are the fastest growing sector of the US child population (Passel, 2011). Thus, it is important to examine how experiences in a country that is not the family's country of origin impinges on youth development. The proposed study seeks to examine how parent-youth acculturation differences (AD) among Latino immigrant families are directly and indirectly linked to youth emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning. Research examining the AD-youth outcomes relationship has rendered mixed findings (Telzer, 2010). Some work indicates a problematic association between AD on youth socio-emotional (Schofield, Parke, Kim, Coltrane, 2008), substance use (Marsiglia, Nagoshi, Parsai, Booth, & Castro, 2014), and behavioral (Szapocznik, Santisteban, Kurtines, Ferez-Vidal & Hervis, 1984) outcomes, while other work does not. Several methodological, conceptual, and measurement limitations have been noted in the current body of work. To reconcile these inconsistencies this study seeks to examine longitudinally: (1) how AD affects family processes that are central to youth development and are salient for immigrant families; (2) how AD affects youth emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning; and (3) how AD indirectly affects youth development through its effects on family processes. A sample of 450 Latino immigrant families will be recruited from high schools in the Central California area. Data will be collected every year for three years from these families on: parent and youth dimensions of acculturation (i.e., cultural values, identity, and language use); family processes that are important for youth development in general (i.e., parental monitoring, communication, and cohesion) and those that are salient among immigrant families (i.e., language brokering and parentification); and youth socio-emotional well-being, risk behaviors, academic achievement, and self-regulation. This study is positioned to make several important contributions to this area of research by: using a multidimensional approach in the measurement of acculturation; examining the longitudinal ramifications of AD on youth development; utilizing a statistically novel approach (latent- difference score analyses) to calculate the AD; identifying specific family processes that serve as mechanisms of influence in the AD-youth outcomes relationship; and informing future prevention efforts geared towards improving the well-being and reducing health disparities among Latino immigrant youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Parent-youth acculturation differences (AD) have been linked, albeit inconsistently, to problematic youth health behaviors such as: tobacco use (Elder et al., 2005), risky sexual practices (Schwartz, 2012), and substance use (Martinez, 2006). What remains unclear and necessitates further examination is the role family processes play in AD-youth outcomes relationship. The proposed study is poised to contribute greatly in the understanding of how the family unit can be used as a mechanism of influence in the AD-youth outcomes relationship to promote positive health and development among 2nd generation immigrant Latino youth.        ",A Longitudinal Analysis of Acculturation Differences between Immigrant Latino Parents and Youth: Implications on Family Functioning and Youth Development,9353222,SC2HD090724,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Behavior ', ' Berry ', ' California ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Immigrant ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive function ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' high school ', ' peer ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' parental monitoring ', ' parent monitoring ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' ']",NICHD,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FRESNO,SC2,2017,140000,0.015986104967029385
"Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE) ABSTRACT The goal of STRIDE (Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment) is to develop, test, and disseminate an integrated multi-level, culturally sensitive intervention to engage African Americans and Latinos in translational research. STRIDE is a partnership of the CTSAs at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Vanderbilt University, three geographically diverse areas with large numbers of African American and Latino constituents. Despite disparities in leading causes of death, morbidity and disability, African Americans and Latinos are under-represented in important translational research studies that have potential to reduce these disparities. Our team's prior work suggests that limited research literacy, defined as “the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information needed to make informed decisions about research participation,” often precludes research participation. Participant barriers also include lack of trust stemming from historical abuses. Research team members often lack skills in cultural competency and may not be sensitive to important issues faced by populations of color. Likewise, informed consent procedures contained within the research system may create confusion and disengagement of diverse participants. The multilevel STRIDE intervention will address these barriers at three levels: patient, research team, and system. The STRIDE intervention builds from synergistic work conducted at the three participating CTSA hubs that includes patient, research staff and systems (e-Consent) targeted interventions. Collectively, our approach will enable research personnel to recruit and deliver informed consent in a culturally competent, literacy appropriate manner, while also improving the “research literacy” of potential research participants. The participant component of the STRIDE intervention will draw upon the power of narrative intervention, or “storytelling,” by harnessing powerful stories from actual research participants describing their experiences, which will be incorporated in community-based outreach forums, the e-consent platform and in clinical settings. The research team component of the STRIDE intervention centers on an innovative application of medical simulation to improve the cultural competency of those recruiting and enrolling diverse participants in translational research. The systems component of the STRIDE intervention will be based on an innovative REDCap e-Consent platform adapted for cultural sensitivity to African American and Latinos and incorporates access to ancillary tools to enhance patient understanding. The project has three Specific Aims that correspond to three study phases. In Aim 1, the comprehensive intervention will be developed and pilot tested. In Aim 2, a multi-site interrupted time series design trial will be conducted to determine the impact of the STRIDE intervention on recruitment of African American and Latino participants in ongoing clinical trials. In Aim 3, dissemination activities will be conducted throughout the CTSA network and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos are not adequately represented in translational research, particularly given the widespread health disparities experienced by these groups. This study aims to develop, test and make widely available a multi-level intervention that is culturally and literacy appropriate to address this critical issue.",Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE),9349616,U01TR001812,"['Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Critiques ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Standardization ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Trust ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' Emotional ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' systems research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community organizations ', ' stem ', ' translational clinical trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' trial design ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2017,1564379,0.04213946715503119
"Physical Activity in Latino Men Through Tailoring: Hombres Saludables ABSTRACT Physical inactivity is a physical inactivity than risk factor for many important chronic diseases. Latino men report higher rates of non-Latinos, are less likely to meet PA guidelines and are disproportionately affected by PA-related health conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. Most Latino PA interventions have focused on women; the vast majority excluded men and none specifically targeted men. Moreover interventions that included men focused mostly on Mexican American only. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective PA interventions with diverse populations of Latino men. NIH has specifically called for research studies to focus on the development and testing of culturally appropriate health-promoting interventions to reduce health disparities among racially and ethnically diverse men. Our research team has 25 years of experience developing, implementing and evaluating individually tailored, theory-based, computer-driven PA interventions including `Seamos Saludables' (in RI) and `Pasos' (in CA), culturally and linguistically adapted, individually- tailored print (Seamos) and web-based (Pasos) interventions for a diverse population of sedentary Latina women that were successful in increasing PA in Latina women. We then conducted formative interviews with Latino men, which confirmed that an intervention would be well-received by them. However, substantial content modifications were needed, so we adapted the print intervention and tested it in a demonstration trial with 10 Mexican American men. After 12 weeks, participants reported a significant increase (p=.03) in mean minutes of PA from 1.50 min/week at baseline to 125.70 min/week at 12 weeks with 100% retention and expressed enthusiasm for the program. However, less than half of the men achieved the PA guidelines of 150 minutes/week. Thus, further enhancements appear to be needed. Follow-up interviews indicated that the intervention was well received, but the men felt that they needed greater accountability, more contact with staff and other participants, briefer and more frequent information, more updates on PA opportunities, and ideas for addressing environmental barriers. The men specifically mentioned interest in web and/or text-based interventions to meet these needs. Thus, we will conduct formative research with a diverse population of Latino men in RI to inform the adaptation of the Pasos web-based intervention that was developed for Latina women, enhance it with new cell phone/text-based intervention components, and ensure that it is culturally appropriate for Latino men of Caribbean, South and Central American origin. We will then conduct a pilot study to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy with a diverse population of Latino men in RI. In the pilot study, we will also explore potential moderators of treatment effects including demographics, acculturation, and environmental variables such as the neighborhood built, social and economic environments. The results of this pilot study will inform a future randomized controlled trial with Latino men to increase PA. Public Health Relevance Latino men report particularly low rates of physical activity (PA) and are disproportionately burdened by health conditions related to sedentary lifestyle. The proposed research will build on a series of previous successful studies to develop an individually tailored intervention using a combination of web and texting that is culturally and linguistically appropriate for a diverse population of Latino men and addresses their PA barriers and preferences. We will conduct focus groups with a diverse population of Latino men to ensure that the intervention is culturally appropriate for Latino men of Caribbean, South and Central American origin and to adapt/develop the new intervention components. Then we will evaluate the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in a pilot study with 50 diverse Latino men.",Physical Activity in Latino Men Through Tailoring: Hombres Saludables,9336342,R34HL128067,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Accountability ', ' Gender ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sedentary ', ' Series ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Central American ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' programs ', ' South American ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Update ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' treatment effect ', ' tailored messaging ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' arm ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R34,2017,240028,0.033228369510563946
"Tu Salud Si Cuenta!  Reaching Latino family dyads to increase physical activity and healthy eating ABSTRACT Most adults in the U.S. fail to meet national physical activity (PA) and dietary recommendations, and Latinos are less likely to meet these recommendations than non-Latino Whites. Physical inactivity, a poor diet, and obesity are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and stroke and are important contributors to preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Social environments are widely recognized to have an important impact on these behaviors, yet most behavior change programs give limited attention to the social contexts in which behaviors occur. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month, community-based family dyad intervention in promoting engagement in and maintenance of PA and healthy eating among Latino adults residing in three predominantly Latino communities in Houston, TX. Dyads will be randomly assigned to a community health worker (CHW)-led intervention, “Tu Salud, ¡Si Cuenta! – Familiar” (TSSC-Family) or to a contact control condition focused on healthy homes. TSSC-Family will consist of six home visits delivered to dyad members over a six-month period to build behavioral skills and social support for sustained healthy behavior change among Latino family dyads. The healthy homes contact control will also consist of six monthly visits delivered to dyad members by a CHW. Study participants will include 552 Latino adults not currently meeting PA or nutrition recommendations recruited and enrolled as family member dyads (n=276 dyads). This approach expands on an empirically- based motivational behavior change intervention developed by a member of the investigative team in collaboration with community partners that has shown preliminary evidence of effectiveness for positive PA and dietary behavior change in Latino individuals. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after baseline to evaluate both intermediate and long-term effects. Primary outcomes include minutes per week of moderate and vigorous PA, and servings of fruits and vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, and whole grains. Weight loss is a secondary outcome. Self-efficacy, stage of change, social support, and social control will also be examined as potential mediators of changes in PA and nutrition. The proposed research is innovative in its use of a novel intervention that emphasizes dyadic social processes in addition to standard behavior change strategies. The intervention explicitly targets family-based social networks to foster social environments supportive of healthy behavior change using CHWs to facilitate home-based outreach and communication to this understudied population. This research is expected to yield critical insight regarding effective approaches for increasing PA and healthy eating among Latinos, the largest and among the fastest growing minority groups in the U.S. NARRATIVE The proposed research seeks to address Latino health disparities in chronic disease risk by evaluating a novel intervention focused on motivation, behavior skills, and family social contexts to increase physical activity and healthy eating in Latino adults. The community-engaged research approach and the use of community health workers to deliver the intervention builds community capacity and enhances the potential to effectively address health disparities. Results will yield critical information regarding effective community-based intervention approaches and facilitate understanding of how this type of intervention can work in real-world settings.",Tu Salud Si Cuenta!

"Innovative Physical Activity Interventions for Overweight Latinos DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the US and are disproportionately impacted by chronic conditions (e.g., overweight/obesity, diabetes) that can be mitigated by physical activity. While evidence-based programs are available to improve physical activity, dissemination is constrained by reliance on costly, limited resources. Short message service (SMS or text messaging) has strong potential as an intervention medium for Latinos, as they are dominant users of mobile phones and text messaging, including those with limited literacy and computer skills. We propose to develop a personalized, culturally-congruent and interactive SMS program to promote the adoption and maintenance of physical activity for overweight, underactive Latino adults and test it for comparable efficacy to an evidence-based telephone-based advising program that has been used successfully with Latinos. Grounded in Social Cognitive and Self-Determination Theories, both programs will include a core set of self-regulatory skill building, social support, and autonomous motivation enhancement, and will be tailored for cultural, linguistic and literacy appropriateness. Randomized at the individual level, 376 sedentary, overweight Latinos ages 45 years and older will be assigned to one of three arms: the SMS- delivered physical activity program, the Human-delivered physical activity program, or an attention-control arm of SMS-delivered basic healthful nutrition advice. They will receive their assigned program for 12 months, and then will be followed for a 6-month maintenance phase, with a final assessment at 18 months. Analyses will determine if the two physical activity programs result in equivalent efficacy in adoption and maintenance of clinically meaningful physical activity increases, and superiority over the attention-control arm at 12 and 18 months. The two physical activity interventions will also be compared for equivalency in prevention of weight gain and reduction in abdominal adiposity. We will explore the relative costs of the programs to determine which program increases physical activity for a lower cost. While health promotion programs delivered by professional staff may be more expensive than those delivered electronically, it is unclear if the automated version can produce more cost-efficient outcomes (i.e., comparable improvements in outcomes for significantly reduced cost). This study will determine if SMS is equivalent in efficacy to the traditional human-delivery channel in increasing physical activity and preventing weight gain, and if it results in a more cost-efficient program. If achieved, this research can significantly reduce health disparities associated with physical activity for Latinos by providing an efficacious tailored and culturally appropriate program poised for widespread dissemination and rapid uptake. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: While there has been a surge of electronic and mobile health promotion programs to increase regular physical activity (a key health behavior linked with the prevention and control of obesity and Type II Diabetes), few have been adapted to meet the needs and preferences of midlife and older Latinos. This research aims to investigate the effectiveness of an automated Simple Message Service (SMS, also known as text messaging) advisor system relative to a proven human advisor program to promote regular, sustained physical activity among inactive, overweight Latinos. The SMS Advisor program represents a potentially lower-cost and high yield alternative to person-delivered health promotion programs that could be more rapidly disseminated with greater and faster uptake.",Innovative Physical Activity Interventions for Overweight Latinos,9336292,R01DK102016,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Automation ', ' Body Weight ', ' Communication ', ' Computers ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Maintenance ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Program Appropriateness ', ' Proverb ', ' Publishing ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Self Determination ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' Latino ', ' Schedule ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' sedentary ', ' Phase ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' waist circumference ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' success ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Touch sensation ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' telehealth ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Text ', ' abdominal adiposity ', ' abdominal fat ', ' health literacy ', ' weight gain prevention ', ' cost ', ' time use ', ' computerized ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based program ', ' comparative ', ' computer generated ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' efficacy testing ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' compare efficacy ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' social anxiety ', ' attentional control ', ' family support ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' vigorous intensity ', ' relative cost ', ' ']",NIDDK,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,664486,0.05119950191441935
"Linking Community and Family Characteristics to Adolescent Adjustment Latino youth in immigrant families are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. school population and face elevated risks of externalizing and internalizing problems and barriers to social and academic competence. Compromised adolescent adjustment harms youth and adult health and promotes inter-generational transmissions of inequality. Parenting processes are strong, malleable correlates of Latino youth adjustment. A glaring weakness in Latino parenting research is inadequate attention to extra-familial cultural demands and opportunities. These demands and opportunities include language use and co-ethnic concentration in neighborhoods; discrimination and support in school and peer contexts; Latino student concentration in schools; peer bullying victimization; and immigrant experiences tied to documentation status, discrimination, migration, and transnationalism. Gaps in research are pronounced for new immigrant destinations, where a lack of established co-ethnic enclaves and language barriers pose unique challenges for Latino families adjusting to life in the U.S. The main goal of this application is to specify the cascade of effects from extra-familial cultural demands and opportunities to Latino adolescent adjustment in an emerging immigrant area. Using culturally informed theory, multi-level data, and multiple mediator models, this research will test the hypothesis that Latino cultural inclusion and support in neighborhood, school, peer and immigrant contexts will lead to declines in youth's externalizing and internalizing problems and increases in youth's social and academic competence during adolescence. The study's mediating hypothesis is that Latino cultural inclusion and support external to the family will influence youth outcomes indirectly by reducing acculturation-related stress (immigrant stressors such as deportation fears, social isolation, and language barriers; parent-child acculturation gaps; demands on youth language brokering) and, in turn, increasing effective parenting (supportive parenting, parental monitoring, family cohesion, low conflict). Effective parenting is hypothesized to be associated reciprocally with adolescents' positive adjustment. Tests of moderated mediation will examine variations in pathways to youth outcomes by adolescents' gender, age, length of U.S. residence, and transition to high school. Using an intentionally missing data design, this study will have 8 time points of data spanning 6th to 11th grade for 600 Latino parent-youth dyads representative of Latinos in a suburban Atlanta school district. The PI's research and partnerships with the school district strengthen feasibility for the proposed study. Data will be analyzed using multilevel, structural equation modeling. In a key departure from individual- and family-level studies, this study will use an integrated theoretical model of culturally relevant extra-familial factors salient to acculturation stressors, parenting, and Latino adolescent adjustment. Results will identify the timing and targets of culture-specific policies and programs enhancing family interventions in new immigrant areas. As one-third of K-12 U.S. students will be Latino in less than a decade, results will inform efforts to reduce the public health burden of poor adjustment among the U.S. school population. Increases in the U.S. Latino population, rapid growth in new immigrant areas, and current policy debates around immigration underscore the timely need for this research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will assess how cultural demands and opportunities in neighborhood, school, peer and immigrant contexts influence acculturation-related stressors and, in turn, parenting processes and adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problems and social and academic competence. Study activities include the collection and analysis of eight time points of survey data over a period of four years for a school-based sample of adolescents (n = 600) and, for a random 50% of participating youth, their mothers (n = 300) in an emerging immigrant destination in suburban Atlanta. Findings will identify the timing and targets of culture-specific policies, programs, and community cultural supports that can enhance existing family-based interventions for Latino youth, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. school population.",Linking Community and Family Characteristics to Adolescent Adjustment,9328567,R01HD090232,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Immigration ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Destinations ', ' Gender ', ' Competence ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Glare ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' intergenerational ', ' high school ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' eleventh grade ', ' high school junior ', ' 11th grade ', ' social ', ' parental monitoring ', ' parent monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' school district ', ' K-12 student ', ' ']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,575027,0.0634971726675798
"Linking state policies to Latino and Asian American immigrant health care access Project Summary/Abstract While many immigrants arrive in the US with good health status, there are persistent disparities in access to health care for immigrant groups that may contribute to their more than expected health declines over time, particularly among the nation's two largest immigrant populations, Latinos and Asians. Since the late 1990s there has also been a proliferation of public policies at the state level that have an impact on immigrant populations. There is growing evidence that immigrant policies are a structural factor associated with disparities in Latino and Asian immigrant health care access. Yet, there is limited understanding of the processes by which policy, a contextual factor, has an impact on individual-level health care access outcomes. This study aims to examine the pathways between state policy and access to care by (1) identifying and assessing the variation among Latino and Asian immigrants' experiences of exclusion related to immigrant policies, (2) understanding the extent to which experiences of policy-related exclusion are associated with barriers to health care, and (3) assessing the extent to which those associations are modified by citizenship status, race/ethnicity, and knowledge of policies. We will conduct a mixed-methods study of the experiences of exclusion among Latino and Asian immigrants in California, a demographically diverse state with a range of state-level immigrant policies. We will assess the association between access to health care and experiences of exclusion across five sectors: health care, social services, education, employment, and law enforcement. We will analyze data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a representative population survey of state residents, combined with a follow-up survey of 2,000 CHIS immigrant respondents that collects additional information on experiences related to immigrant policies. We will also conduct semi-structured interviews of immigrants in two regions to identify the nuances of their experiences of and responses to those policies. The findings from this research can both identify policies outside the health sector that have impacts on immigrant access to health care, and suggest educational interventions which could improve immigrant knowledge in ways that improves their access to needed health care. Project narrative This study will contribute to knowledge regarding the impact of public policies on access to health care by examining the experiences of Latino and Asian immigrants. It will build from research on the social determinants of health to understand the pathways between contextual social factors and individual-level health access outcomes.",Linking state policies to Latino and Asian American immigrant health care access,9427922,R01MD012292,"['Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Employment ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Exclusion ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' Latin American ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2017,612139,0.06449381085326938
"Self-regulation development and the transition to middle school Self-regulation and the transition to middle school  The transition from elementary to middle school often precipitates a downward spiral in academic performance characterized by declining grades, academic disengagement, and eventual high school drop-out. During this same period, risky behaviors such as substance abuse and sexual risk-taking increase. Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition. Disentangling the factors contributing to the academic success/failure of low-income African American and Latino youth requires viewing development as a complex developmental process with “intertwined developmental trajectories, social pathways, and social convoys” (Benner, 2011). For low-income African American and Latino youth in particular, it is important to consider the intersection of social class, culture, and ethnicity for children of color transitioning to middle school. Life course theory suggests that early life stress can have a cumulative effect on development. Accordingly, individual level vulnerabilities at multiple levels of the youth ecology (individual, family, school, and neighborhood) can be potentiated during times of exposure to additional normative stressors, such as developmental transition points. Minority youth from low-SES families not only experience difficulties associated with poverty but also cultural stress (e.g., assimilation, discrimination) which undermine their ability to face normative stressors such as transitioning into middle school.  We propose to follow a large cohort of low-income African American and Latino children first enrolled at age 2½ as part of the Dallas Preschool Readiness Project (DPReP) as they transition into middle school. DPReP participants have completed four waves of data collection that have included measures of emerging self- regulation skills, academic achievement, and behavior problems. By following this sample into middle school, we will characterize trajectories of self-regulation development to address the following primary aims: Aim 1. Examine how individual differences in trajectories of self-regulation development from 2½ years into  middle school are related to differences in academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school for  low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 2. Examine how the interrelated contexts of family, school and neighborhood contribute to the middle  school academic and behavioral adjustment of low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 3. Examine how the relation of family, school, and neighborhood contexts to academic and behavioral  adjustment in middle school is both mediated and moderated by self-regulation skills among low-  income African Americans and Latinos. Data collection methods will include home visits, phone interviews, teacher surveys, and classroom and neighborhood observations. Measures include child self-regulation, assessments of academic performance and social competence, family environment, classroom environment, teacher-child relationship, and neighborhood conditions. Analytic methods will include structural equations modeling, and latent differences models. Project Narrative The transition from elementary to middle school often precipitates a downward spiral in academic performance characterized by declining grades, academic disengagement, and eventual high school drop-out. Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition, and the stark race/ethnic disparities in high school graduation rates and educational attainment likely reflect its long- term consequences. Children with better self-regulation in early childhood display better academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school. In this study, we will follow a cohort of 365 low-income African American and Latino children originally enrolled at age 2½ and reassessed at age 3½, kindergarten, and first grade to conduct additional assessments in 4th through 7th grade to examine the role of self-regulation skills, family-level processes and neighborhood conditions in explaining academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school.",Self-regulation development and the transition to middle school,9382680,R01HD075311,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Buffers ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Phonation ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Social Class ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Assimilations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' analytical method ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Exposure to ', ' Complex ', ' first grade ', ' 1st grade ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' seventh grade ', ' 7th grade ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' kindergarten ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Family Process ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' critical period ', ' early adolescence ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' Graduation Rates ', ' Attainment Rate ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic identity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2017,638120,0.050536777385074325
"SALUD: Syndemic Alcohol Use Disorders, Violence, and HIV/STI in Young Latino Men Project Summary: Given the pervasive disparities in alcohol use disorders (AUD) and HIV among young Latino men, the proposed training plan will build upon my work on HIV transmission risk and co-morbidities by training me in: 1) alcohol and HIV epidemiology, 2) the integration of biological measures with behavioral science, and 3) longitudinal data analysis, while expanding the scope of my health disparities research to include Latino men. With the guidance of my exceptional Mentor Team, the proposed training aims will be achieved with a combination of in-/formal coursework and workshops in alcohol epidemiology, stress response biomarkers, and longitudinal statistical methods as well as practical experience in primary data collection, assay, and analysis, of salivary, urinary, and blood stress biomarkers with behavioral data in ethnic minority populations. In addition, this K01 will provide me with guidance to develop skills for a successful academic career and support for my transition into an independent investigator. Men make up 87% of new HIV infections among Latinos. Latino men play a central role in bridging HIV/STI across sexual networks due to their sexual risk behaviors (e.g., concurrent sex partners, unprotected anal sex, same-sex [MSM] activity). Furthermore, harmful alcohol use increases risk behavior and IPV perpetration, all factors associated with a substantially increased risk for HIV/STI. The syndemic co-occurrence of AUD, intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV/STI is theorized to take root in systemic socio-structural disadvantage, but the mechanisms causing this syndemic are not well understood, especially in Latino men. The Social Stress Theory suggests that social inequity elevates exposure and vulnerability to stress, limits access to coping resources, and increases AUD and HIV disparities. The proposed longitudinal, epidemiological study aims to elucidate the temporal sequence of AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI, as well as identify risk/protective social stress factors in Latino men (versus white men) during their critical transition from adolescence (12-18 years) to mid-adulthood (32-42 years). To achieve this, we propose secondary analysis of four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n=5,140), which contains rich social, behavioral, and biological data (e.g., stress response, HIV/STI biomarkers). Findings from this research will inform the development of more effective AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI prevention and treatment interventions for Latino men, and will highlight sub-group nuances among Latino men (e.g., by non-/white race, national sub-group, and sexual orientation). Classified as High Priority by the NIH Office of AIDS Research, this K01 will provide cross- cutting research training for a highly productive ethnic minority junior investigator to conduct HIV/AIDS Research to Reduce Latino Health Disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections and to understand the role of chronic inflammation and AUD in exacerbating these disparities. Project narrative: SALUD (Cheers/Health) aims to elucidate the temporal sequence of alcohol use disorders (AUD), intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV/STI, and to identify risk/protective socio- structural factors, and stress and coping factors among Latino men (versus white men; n=5,140) in their critical transition from adolescence (12-18 years) to mid-adulthood (32-42 years). Identifying socio-structural and stress and coping targets for intervention will inform the development of more effective AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI prevention and treatment interventions for Latino men. Furthermore, the proposed training in alcohol and HIV epidemiology, integration of biological measures with behavioral science, and longitudinal data analysis will provide cross- cutting research training for a productive ethnic minority junior investigator in areas classified as High Priority (by the NIH Office of AIDS Research), and position her as an independent investigator and leader in Latino disparities in alcohol and HIV.","SALUD: Syndemic Alcohol Use Disorders, Violence, and HIV/STI in Young Latino Men",9271765,K01AA025009,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Buffers ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EBV ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"A Randomized Clinical Trial Of Culturally Tailored MI DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application addresses the priority area Treatment for Health Disparities/Special Populations. Epidemiological and psychosocial research indicates that Latinos suffer greater adverse effects from hazardous drinking compared to other racial/ethnic groups, including higher rates of cirrhosis fatality and alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes. Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer alcohol-related health disparities, are less likely to initiate and to remai in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with high density of alcohol outlets. However, research on the field is challenged by the lack of studies comparing tailored to non-tailored treatments. We have pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905) demonstrating that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers. This study will be the basis for the current proposed study, which is a larger scale version of the pilot. The key modification was to incorporate social stressors in the context of acculturation. Thus, in the proposed study, we will also explore acculturation stress as an influence on the relationship between acculturation and alcohol consumption behavior. The public health impact of this study will be to develop a program of early screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous drinking among Latinos in communities that may lack such services. By providing early screening and intervention, we hope to minimize the burden of illness and social consequences that disproportionately affect Latino communities. Study Design: 357 Latino men and women who meet criteria for hazardous drinking (> 5/occasion for men, >4/occasion for women) will be recruited from the community. Following informed consent, they will complete a baseline assessment in either Spanish or English, and will then be randomized to receive either un-tailored motivational intervention (MI) or a culturally-tailored motivational intervention (CTMI). Participant randomization will be balanced by language preference, gender, alcohol severity, acculturation stress, and negative consequences, to ensure there is equivalent representation in each cell. Participants will be contacted by research assistants unaware of treatment assignment at 2, 6, and 12 months follow-up. Primary Aim 1: It is hypothesized that those randomized to receive the tailored treatment will report fewer alcohol- related negative consequences and fewer heavy drinking days at follow-up vs. those randomized to receive the un-tailored treatment. Primary Aim 2: Explore acculturation stress as a moderator of alcohol treatment outcomes. Long term goals: Develop a model of care that is easily disseminated in the community, and to generate theoretically-informed hypotheses to better understand how acculturation stress and processes confer risk for increased drinking among Latinos. We expect that this project will contribute needed knowledge about the role of acculturation stress in alcohol drinking behavior and treatment response. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Culturally-tailored empirically-based interventions are needed because Latinos suffer a greater burden of alcohol-related health disparities and negative social consequences compared to other racial/ethnic groups, are less likely to initiate and to remain in treatment, and are more likely to live in communities with a high density of alcohol outlets. Pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905), which will serve as the basis for the current proposed larger-scale study, demonstrated that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers. The public health impact of this study will be to develop a program of early screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous drinking among Latinos, to minimize the burden of illness and social

"Diabetes disparities in Latino subpopulations: linking biology to social epidemiology Abstract The overall goal for this application for an NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the candidate, Sandra Albrecht, PhD, MPH, with indispensable training and protected time to build an independent, transdisciplinary research program at the interface of the biomedical and socio-ecological domains to provide a more complete understanding of the factors underlying progression to and from type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Latino subpopulations. Responding to the staggering burden of T2D and poor glucose control in U.S. Latinos, to unanswered questions regarding variation in disease risk and burden within this broad population, and to the dearth of longitudinal studies in this area, the research aims are to 1) Characterize patterns of glucose dysregulation over time in non-diabetic Latino ethnic subgroups, and evaluate the role of social, environmental, and clinical factors in driving that variation; (2) Characterize patterns of T2D progression over time in diabetic Latino ethnic subgroups, and evaluate the role of social, environmental, and clinical factors in driving that variation; and (3) Characterize the effectiveness of a key social determinant – healthcare utilization - for successful T2D management within a specific Latino subpopulation, and evaluate how other social, environmental, and clinical factors modify that effectiveness. Data for Aims 1 and 2 will come from a large national longitudinal population-based study with oversamples of Latino subgroups: the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Data for Aim 3 will come from electronic health record data from a large healthcare system in North Carolina, a region with a fast growing Latino population. As part of this aim, Latino diabetic subjects will be recruited for a pilot study evaluating self-reported barriers to achieving control of glucose as part of a long-term effort to integrate social factors into the clinical management of T2D. To match the scope of the proposed scientific work, the candidate will seek to integrate her expertise in the social epidemiology of obesity and diabetes with the following career development and training areas: 1) training in the physiology of glucose dysregulation; 2) understanding of clinical issues relevant to T2D prevention and treatment; and 3) use of electronic health records data and health informatics. This training will be augmented with career-building activities to acquire essential tools for leadership and professional growth, as well as dissemination and translation of findings. Experts have emphasized the need for a more complete understanding of subgroup-specific T2D physiology and of subgroup-specific risk factors underlying progression to and from T2D. This K01 project will impact public health by improving characterization of T2D outcomes in Latino subpopulations to inform tailored prevention and treatment strategies. The project builds upon exceptional resources and mentoring at the candidate's institution (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), to train her in key new areas, bolster applications for competitive funding, disseminate findings among researchers and the wider community, augment faculty diversity, and attain research independence. Project Narrative This proposal addresses a central challenge in type 2 diabetes (T2D) research: prioritizing efforts to reduce disparities in U.S. Latinos. With this award, I will build an independent, transdisciplinary research program at the interface of the biomedical and socio-ecological domains to provide a more complete understanding of the factors underlying progression to and from T2D specific to Latinos. This research will inform translational approaches to reduce T2D burden taking into the account the enormous variability of the U.S. Latino population.",Diabetes disparities in Latino subpopulations:

"Cultural Neuroscience of Latino Mental Health: Collectivism and the Psychophysiology of Self-Regulation in Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Latino adolescents in the United States face a number of mental health disparities. In particular, this group appears to experience an excessive disease burden due to social anxiety. In line with National Institute of Mental Health research initiatives, the present study seeks to examine how cultural factors relevant to Latinos are related to neural correlates thought to be associated with clinical dimensions of social anxiety, in an effort to inform the design of tailored prevention and intervention efforts aimed at mitigating mental health inequalities. Specifically, the present study plans to investigate the association of collectivism (an attitudinal cultural value in which group cohesion and interpersonal relationships are given great value and priority) and two event-related brain potential (ERP) components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and the feedback negativity (FN). The ERN and FN are negative deflections in the ERP that occur following error detection and receipt of feedback. Extensive literature links them to cognitive processes (exaggerated error-monitoring and feedback response) that contribute to social anxiety symptomatology. These electrophysiological measures have also been conceptualized as reflections of individual variance in threat sensitivity. Specifically, the meaning of a certain context to an individual can enhance the neural response to errors or feedback. In line with this understanding, for individuals who endorse adherence to collectivism, the social context is thought to have especially high importance. Thus, errors and negative feedback that take place in a social context are more salient, which is manifested in enhanced ERN and FN. We aim to test three manipulations of social context in samples of Latino (n = 37) and non-Latino Caucasian (n = 37) adolescents using electrophysiological research methods (ERPs). Each task will include an ecologically valid manipulation of social environment that reflects facets of the cultural and developmental group under study. The three experimental tasks are complementary in their ability to address the notion that culture interacts with neural mechanisms associated with cognitive processes that contribute to social anxiety symptoms. Consistent with a cultural neuroscience perspective, this research intends to explore how an individual’s view of themselves and their connections to others play a critical role in determining the implicit meaning and value of the social context and of one’s neural response to social stimuli. Findings may have translational implications and inform the science that guides the development of culturally appropriate anxiety treatment for underserved youth. The long-term goal of this project is to provide the applicant with training that will set the stage for a career in the field of pediatric cultural clinical neuroscience. Thus, the proposed fellowship is designed to promote acquisition of new knowledge and skills related to psychophysiological research methods, as well as to integrate training in cultural and developmental frameworks. Project Narrative The present study aims to examine the interaction of culture and brain-behavior associations that contribute to anxiety-related disparities in Latino adolescents, an underserved group.

"Salud Juntos: A Promotora-Led Home-Based Cancer Care Support Solution ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is in response to RFA EB-15-001, a special SBIR program to reduce health disparities by developing medical technologies that are ""effective, affordable, culturally acceptable, and easily accessible to those who need them."" It is based on the well-established partnership between BrightOutcome and Dr. Ana Maria Lopez, Associate Vice President for Health Equity and Inclusion, University of Utah Health Sciences Center, and Director of Cancer Health Equity, Huntsman Cancer Institute. We propose co-development of ¡Salud Juntos!, a bilingual ""high tech and high touch"" medical care support portal for Latinos, the most rapidly growing group in the U.S. By leveraging both e-health technologies and actual human connections. ¡Salud Juntos!'s can expand to encompass health concerns comprehensively. Our target domain for this project will be the cancer care continuum, from cancer diagnosis/treatment though survivorship/palliation, with Phase I focusing on cancer symptom management. The ""high tech"" aspect of ¡Salud Juntos! utilizes technology features such as mobile access, social media support, adaptive health status assessment, and individualized content deliveries to connect patients and families to care. The ""high touch"" aspect, a critical and unique component of ¡Salud Juntos!, facilitates patient engagement through community health workers/promotoras who can personally deliver the requisite education and support to individuals and the community. ¡Salud Juntos!'s high-tech features will be adapted for promotoras to use to manage their day-to-day tasks. The use of both high-tech and high-touch solutions ensures a broad reach across the digital divide and addresses health delivery barriers including knowledge, culture, and distance. The overarching goal of ¡Salud Juntos! is to improve cancer patients' outcomes and self-efficacy by empowering cancer patients with self-management skills and bringing cancer care support directly to them at home via both promotoras and technology. Such supportive care, regardless whether delivered by promotoras or by technology, addresses both physical and psychosocial concerns and needs of cancer patients by offering timely patient education materials, engaging local/community support resources, facilitating patient-provider communication, and involving patients caregivers, friends and families. Phase I aims are to: 1) Collect input from stakeholders on expected system features, perceived usefulness/impacts, and potential adoption barriers via four focus groups of ten subjects each. Stakeholders include promotoras, supportive care professionals, Latino cancer patients, and their caregivers; 2) Design/develop the prototype ¡Salud Juntos! by following a user-centered design process and leveraging the technical/functional foundations from our prior work; 3) Conduct two rounds of usability/usefulness tests with 32 subjects each, and a pilot study with 60 subjects randomized to receive usual care (control) and promotora support with ¡Salud Juntos! (intervention) on a 1:1 ratio to conduct preliminary effectiveness evaluation and assess technical feasibility. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latinos are now the largest and the fastest growing minority group in the U.S. However, the health disparities experienced by Latinos in the U.S. have been well documented. Based on the 2001-2005 AHRQ's Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data, the median healthcare expenditure for Latinos was 78.8% lower than that for White, non-Latinos. It is estimated that reducing the health disparities for Latinos would have saved the US economy a staggering $115 billion between 2006 and 2009.

"Risk Behaviors in Preadolescent Boys PROJECT SUMMARY Perceived discrimination is a concrete aspect of racism with well-documented health implications for people of color in the U.S. Importantly, such health disparities related to perceived discrimination are clearly evident among Latino youth, the largest racial/ethnic minority segment of the increasingly diverse American child population and a particularly vulnerable group subjected to discriminatory treatment. To date, the growing literature on the health implications of perceived discrimination has not really delved into sexual risk-taking, which is curious given that it is a key component of Healthy People 2020 and in light of the plethora of research highlighting the disproportionately higher rates of STDs, HIV/AIDS, and unintended pregnancies afflicting Latino adolescents. Studying this link in this population, therefore, has significant  PROJECT NARRATIVE This project connects two topics with clear health significance—perceived discrimination and sexual risk- taking—in a critical population of interest. Based on a successful pilot study that already addressed many of the practical barriers to studying this topic in this population – we test the pathways through with perceived discrimination affects Latino preadolescents' sexual risk behaviors and identify culturally congruent developmental processes that support sexual health. An examination of these factors during the sensitive period of early adolescence, when Latino youth are particularly vulnerable to discrimination and before sexual activity becomes common, can help in the development of gender and culturally-based prevention and intervention programs for Latino adolescents.",Risk Behaviors in Preadolescent Boys,9244620,R03HD086600,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent boy ', ' Male Adolescents ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Gender Role ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' permissiveness ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Funding ', ' Pattern ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' expectation ', ' Prevention program ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' boys ', ' girls ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Address ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' sex ', ' Permission ', ' Authorization ', ' Authorization documentation ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Unplanned pregnancy ', ' unintended pregnancy ', ' initiation of intercourse ', ' early sexual initiation ', ' early sex initiation ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adolescence ', ' HIV/STD ', ' STI/HIV ', ' STD/HIV ', ' HIV/STI ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' study population ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R03,2017,75876,0.021040883278815214
"Detection, Understanding and Reduction of Latino Health Care Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although Latinos represent one of the fastest-growing populations entering substance use disorder (SUD) treatment, they are the most likely to lack health insurance and receive disparate care in terms of treatment access, quality, and outcomes. In particular, Mexican Americans represent the largest population of uninsured and critically underserved ethnic minority individuals in the United States. As such, it is not surprisng that the Institute of Medicine (IOM) and other federal institutions have called for systematic collection of health care data on specific Latino subgroups10 to define vulnerable subpopulations, identify determinants of disparities, and prepare the health care system to develop solutions to promote health equities. The lack of representative datasets with an adequate number of Mexican Americans and information on provider quality of care to accurately explore and identify health care disparities has represented a key barrier to greater knowledge regarding strategies to improve Mexican Americans' treatment outcomes.5 Thus, using a multilevel and multiyear dataset, which includes data collected from 101 outpatient SUD treatment programs and 14,610 clients in 2011 and 2013, we will seek to detect IOM-defined disparities in terms of client achievement of 30- day sobriety at successful treatment completion. Guided by Kilbourne, Switzer, Hyman, Crowley-Matoka, and Fine's (2006) conceptual framework for advancing health disparities research, and consistent with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) conceptual framework for public health,15 we will examine these disparities at both the individual and program level. Aim 1 will focus on detection of treatment disparities between Mexican-Americans and non-Latino Whites and Aim 2 will focus on understanding the extent to which key organizational factors (e.g., acceptance of public insurance, delivery of evidence-based treatment [EBT], and delivery of culturally and linguistically appropriate services [CLAS]) may help in the reduction of these treatment disparities. Aim 3 seeks to expand upon the NICE conceptual framework by testing the extent to which increases in programs' acceptance of public insurance (i.e., Medicaid), which will expand as part of the ACA and mostly affect Latinos in Los Angeles County, may lead to improvements in quality of care (i.e., delivery of EBT and CLAS). The proposed analysis of existing data represents a timely and cost-efficient opportunity to have a large overall impact on Latino health care disparities research and policy, especially given the innovative aspect of the proposed research is to detect, understand and reduce client- and program- level disparities for Mexican Americans, who constitute the largest Latino subgroup in the United States. Finally, given the increasing focus on health care reform and its consequences (both positive and negative), the proposed study is believed to have the potential for high overall impact because it will be one of the first known studies to examine the extent to which increases in acceptance of public health insurance, which is a key component of the ACA, lead to increases in quality of care in community-based SUD treatment. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine has called for the examination of Latino subgroups in order to identify vulnerable subpopulations (e.g., Mexican Americans), as well as to better understand the causes of important disparities in health care and inform interventions to reduce such disparities. Thus, this study is of high public health relevance given it will provide federal and state insurance administrators, policy makers, and community-based substance abuse treatment providers with new and critical information to help promote health equities for the most uninsured and critically underserved ethnic minority subpopulation in the United States (i.e., Mexican Americans).","Detection, Understanding and Reduction of Latino Health Care Disparities",9316614,R01DA038608,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Affect ', ' California ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Health Services Needs ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' County ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Uninsured ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' intervention program ', ' treatment program ', ' sobriety ', ' sober ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Subgroup ', ' Sum ', ' Collection ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' substance abuse therapy ', ' substance abuse treatment ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' health definition ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' Obamacare ', ' minority communities ', ' urban setting ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,248255,0.0589783291223302
"Bilingualism and Resilience in Latino Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Latino adolescents have among the highest rates of functionally impairing depressive symptoms, including the highest rates of suicidal behavior. A significant and growing percentage of Latino youth live in poverty, which further increases their risk for depressive symptoms. Although coping skills programs have proven beneficial for preventing or reducing risk for depressive symptoms, low-socioeconomic status (low-SES) Latino youth have among the lowest rates of utilization of conventional mental health services, greatly limiting the effectiveness of these coping programs for this population. Thus, these youth could benefit from alternative approaches to prevention and intervention. A key first step in improving prevention efforts involves the identification of indigenous, accessible, and culturally acceptable processes that support coping and reduce risk for depressive symptoms. Bilingual language development is one such factor that is highly prevalent, but occurs at varying levels of exposure, usage, and proficiency, in low-SES Latino youth. Bilingualism supports the development of executive function (EF), and higher EF has been linked to more adaptive coping and lower levels of depressive symptoms. However, no research has examined associations between bilingualism and depressive symptoms in Latino youth. Therefore, the purpose of the current R03 is to examine the link between degree of bilingualism and the development of depressive symptoms, as well as the potential mediators (EF and coping) of this link, in a sample of low-SES Latino adolescents. We will assess degree of bilingualism, EF, coping and depressive symptoms at baseline and 12 months later in 80 bilingual Latino youth ages 10-13 years old. We focus on this age range because levels of depressive symptoms spike by middle adolescence, making early adolescence a crucial period for prevention and early intervention. Assessments will include youth and parent reports of all variables as well as testing of youth language proficiency and EF. The Specific Aims of the proposed project are to 1) determine the prospective association between degree of bilingualism and development of depressive symptoms over one year in low-SES Latino youth, and 2) assess executive function and coping as potential mediators of the association between bilingualism and development of depressive symptoms over one year. The successful completion of this project will lead to a multi-wave, multi-site R01 proposal to identify pathways from bilingual language development to mental health outcomes in a diverse population of youth. The long-term goal of this line of research is to reduce disparities in depressive symptoms and their health consequences affecting low-SES Latino adolescents and similar high-risk, underserved youth populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Latino adolescents experience disproportionate rates of depressive symptoms and related negative health consequences, including suicidal behavior.

"Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 proposal is to develop a culturally tailored nutrition communication intervention for primary prevention of breast cancer among bicultural Latinas. The overarching goal of the study is to advance understanding of how communication and acculturation processes influence cancer risk behaviors in order to design effective culturally tailored interventions to reduce cancer risk behaviors. This approach is particularly relevant when considering research on the health of the population of CA's San Joaquin Valley (SJV). A vast, largely rural region that produces over half of the nation's fruit, nuts, and vegetables, SJV is 50% Latino, mostly of Mexican origin6. The SJV has a very diverse Latino population: 25% are foreign-born, and their primary language may be an indigenous Mexican language rather than Spanish, while 75% are native-born U.S. citizens, who possess varied fluency in English abilities and whose families may include both legal and undocumented immigrants. The linguistic and acculturative diversity of this population poses new challenges for understanding how to design effective behavior change interventions. Most community-based interventions with Latinos have focused on those who speak Spanish exclusively, limiting our understanding of how acculturation and linguistic diversity impact communication intervention design and effectiveness. mHealth strategies offer a way of delivering interventions that are not only culturally appropriate for Latinos across the acculturation spectrum, but also appropriate for primary cancer prevention among young adults who are eager adopters of technology. This study aims to fill the knowledge gaps through a research plan designed around three sequential aims employing mixed methods for message testing and community intervention research. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with SJV Latinas (N=25) to explore factors that influence diet and food preparation behaviors as well as barriers and facilitators to the adoption of healthier diets. Results will inform the content categories for message tailoring, the structure of the messages, and the means of dissemination. In Aim 2, we will use the findings from Aim 1 to build and test a library of messages that are culturally appropriate for bicultural Latinas using focus groups and cognitive interviews. Aim 3 is the design, pilot test, and evaluation of an intervention to improve diet behaviors. The intervention consists of a series of culturally appropriate messages, developed in Aim 2, tailored to each participant's needs and preferences, to be disseminated via mobile phone over a 4-week period. We will evaluate preliminary outcomes (e.g., usage and feedback about the intervention and changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions) at four different times. We will determine preliminary estimates of effect size for behavioral outcomes (consumption of dietary fat, fruits and vegetables), based on two post-intervention data collections. We will additionally evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability in order to refine the intervention for a future larger randomized controlled trial, to be proposed in an R01 application before the end of this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The demographic and risk factor profiles for Latinos suggest a looming cancer epidemic: Latinos are younger, poorer, and less likely to have access to cancer screening than the general population. The ""Acculturation Paradox"" further suggests that acculturation is a risk factor for diet-related breast cancer risk. This project aims to improve eating behaviors as a primary cancer prevention strategy, and the emphasis on young adult, bicultural Latinas focuses on those at high preventable cancer risk. The overall goals of this career development grant are to improve understanding of (a) factors that influence Latinas' cancer-related behaviors that may be modifiable through communication-based strategies, and (b) factors that influence Latinas' communication preferences and intervention effectiveness, in order to inform a culturally appropriate mHealth intervention.",Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas,9105361,K01CA190659,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' dietary lipid ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Nuts ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' mammary tumor prevention ', ' mammary cancer prevention ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' good diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Categories ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Health Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' food preparation ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' tailored messaging ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' reduced food intake ', ' reduced eating ', ' eat less ', ' ethnic identity ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, MERCED",K01,2017,126865,0.023015295420747706
"The Effect of Pesticide Exposure on Cognitive and Brain Development in Latino Children: PACE5 Concern is mounting that commonly used pesticides are detrimental to children. Children are rapidly undergoing cognitive, sensory, and motor development, and disruption of normal maturation can have life-long consequences. The extant literature strongly indicates that prenatal exposure to pesticides leads to abnormal neurobehavioral development. A recent brain imaging study further showed that prenatal pesticide exposure is associated with disrupted anatomical brain development. However, results concerning the consequences of postnatal pesticide exposure are much less conclusive. Some studies have reported neurobehavioral deficits following postnatal pesticide exposure, but just as many studies have reported no negative consequences. Currently there are no studies that assess the effects of postnatal pesticide exposure on brain development using anatomical or functional brain imaging. More conclusive research on the effects of postnatal exposure on neurodevelopment requires a highly exposed population, a longitudinal design, and careful quantification of exposure and outcomes. We propose a two-group, prospective, longitudinal study of Latino children 7 years of age with quarterly measurement of cumulative pesticide exposure using passive dosimetry wristbands as well as documentation of prenatal and early life exposure through life history techniques. Children from Latino seasonal farmworker families will be compared with children from Latino families not participating in farm work and not living in an agricultural environment. Children in Latino farmworker families are at particularly high risk of exposure. Not only are pesticides frequently used in their low quality housing, but they are also exposed to agricultural pesticides used in nearby fields brought home by parental/sibling farmworkers on clothing. Children will be followed for 2 years with measurement of neurobehavioral function at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. Neuroimaging will be performed in a subset of participants with structural and functional brain organization assessed at baseline and two years later. Specific aims for this project are: Aim 1: Compare 2-year longitudinal and prenatal/early life pesticide exposure between children of Latino seasonal farmworkers and children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Aim 2: Compare 2-year longitudinal neurobehavioral and emotional and behavioral functioning among children of Latino seasonal farmworkers relative to children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Aim 3: Compare 2-year longitudinal anatomical and functional brain development between children of Latino seasonal farmworkers and children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Our nearly two decades of environmental justice (EJ) and community-based participatory research (CBPR) on pesticide exposure with farmworkers and their families provides an auspicious context to engage this vulnerable population in a study of both scientific and environmental justice importance. Most research indicates that prenatal pesticide exposure is detrimental to the developing brain. However, results concerning the effects of postnatal pesticide exposure on brain development are conflicting. The current project will evaluate the effects of pesticide exposure on neurobehavioral and brain development children from Latino farmworker families.",The Effect of Pesticide Exposure on Cognitive and Brain Development in Latino Children: PACE5,9379147,R01ES008739,"['Affect ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' choline esterase II ', ' Acylcholineacylhydrolase ', ' Acylcholine acylhydrolase ', ' Cholinesterases ', ' Clothing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Housing ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Parents ', ' Pest Control ', ' Pesticides ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Exposure to ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' postnatal ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Farming environment ', ' Farm ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' life history ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' dosimetry ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Documentation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' developmental disease/disorder ', ' developmental disorder ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Organophosphates ', ' Motor ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Calendar ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' pesticide exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 7 year old ', ' seven years of age ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 7 years of age ', ' neurotoxic ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' environmental justice ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' imaging study ', ' agricultural pesticide ', ' ']",NIEHS,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2017,638539,0.11835069153271467
"Enhanced Primary Care Nutrition and Screen time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Primary Care Based Feeding and Screen Time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants Latino children experience higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic white children, a disparity that emerges in infancy. Among Latino children, those with Spanish-speaking parents are at highest risk for obesity. Research has shown that optimal feeding strategies in early life and avoidance of screen time may lower the risk of childhood obesity, which in turn, reduces the risk of obesity and its comorbidities through    adulthood. However, few interventions have sought to promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino parents. In addition, most interventions in the literature that address infant obesity prevention have been conducted through home visits or special trips to the intervention site by parents, approaches that may not be sustainable in low-resource settings due to cost and the burden on participants. Given that infants are expected to have 7 well-child visits in the first year of life, primary care is an ideal setting in which to ofer parental education on infant feeding and screen time recommendations. The overall objective of this proposal is to design, pilot test, and refine a Spanish-language, culturally appropriate, primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in Latino infants born to Spanish-speaking    mothers. Our overarching hypothesis is that focused education on infant feeding and screen time avoidance will lead to use of optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers and result in less weight gain in the first year of life. In preparation for submitting an R01 application to test this hypothesis, we propose research with the following specific aims to be conducted at the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) outpatient pediatric clinic: Aim 1: Use the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to design 5 group educational modules that promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers; Aim 2: Use a pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to test a yearlong intervention in which the 5 modules (Aim 1) are provided to Spanish-speaking Latino mothers just after well-child visits at ages 2 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, and 12 months (primary outcomes will include use of responsive feeding practices, infant dietary intake, and infant active and passive television viewing time; secondary outcomes will be infant anthropometrics); Aim 3: Use qualitative methods to assess how individual components of the intervention from Aim 2 affected feeding and screen time practices. By the conclusion of    this award, we will have a scalable and potentially reproducible intervention for infant feeding and screen time practices, one that is linguistically and culturally appropriate for Spanish-speaking Latino parents and aims to reduce weight gain in the first year of life while promoting habits that protect against obesity across the lifespan. Dr. Amy Beck, PI for this mentored career development award, is a bilingual pediatrician with considerable clinical experience caring for low-income Latino children and a deep commitment to improving health outcomes    in this population. Dr. Beck is a pediatric attending at SFGH (a public hospital affiliated with UCSF that serves a majority Latino population) where she provides both general pediatric care and also is the co-director of the pediatric obesity clinic. With respect to her research background, Dr. Beck holds a MPH and completed a General Pediatrics research fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). During her fellowship, Dr. Beck used both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate risk factors for obesity among Latino children. She has 5 first-author publications, of which 4 directly inform this proposal. She is currently conducting two pilot intervention studies in obesity prevention and treatment for Latino children. Her long-term career goal is to be an independent investigator in the field of obesity prevention with a focus on improving preventive services for low-income Latino children. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Beck must strengthen her skills in biostatistics and qualitative methods and acquire new skills in dietary analysis and RCTs of behavioral interventions. Dr. Beck has formed an    interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors and consultants with expertise in general pediatrics, nutrition, psychology, anthropology, Latino health, pediatric obesity, and health policy. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Cabana, is an internationally respected health services researcher and the Division Chief of General Pediatrics at UCSF. Dr. Cabana has extensive expertise in the design and conduct of RCTs in the ambulatory setting and a strong track record of mentorship. In addition to her mentored research plan and ongoing tutorials with her    diverse mentorship team, Dr. Beck will take advantage of UCSF's numerous opportunities for research training. She will enroll in additional courses offered through the Training in Clinical Research Program that cover specific areas of her career development plan. She will also take a course at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health on dietary assessment. Finally, she will attend seminars offered by the Division of General Pediatrics and participate in the K scholars program offered by the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at UCSF. Dr. Beck has the full support of the UCSF Department of Pediatrics and the Division of General Pediatrics for this proposed award. By the conclusion of this award, Dr. Beck will be well positioned as an    independent investigator in the field of childhood obesity prevention research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the proposed research are to design and evaluate a low-cost, primary care-based intervention to prevent the onset of obesity in Latino infants. This proposal is relevant to public health because obesity often begins early in life and is associated with diabetes, heart disease, and numerous other comorbidities, and because Latino children in the United States experience disproportionately high rates of obesity. The goal of the proposed intervention is to promote infant feeding, nutrition and screen time practices that will be protective against obesity across the lifespan.",Enhanced Primary Care Nutrition

"Advancing the Science of Cancer in Latinos Advancing the Science of Cancer in Latinos Project Summary/Abstract The proposed conference, “Advancing the Science of Cancer in Latinos,” would occur February 21-23, 2018, in San Antonio, Texas. This proposed conference—hosted by the Cancer Therapy and Research Center, an NCI-designated cancer center, and the Institute for Health Promotion Research at UT Health San Antonio—represents the first-ever international conference focused specifically on the science of cancer health disparities among Latino communities. Although there has been substantial progress in cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment over the past several decades, progress has not kept pace among certain population regarding health disparities, such as differences in access to care, less frequent use of proven screening tests, higher rates of advanced cancer diagnoses and higher mortality rates. Latinos in particular are among the groups with the highest rate of new cancer cases in the US. As the issue of disparities in Latinos has gained more attention in cancer research and public health communities, it has become apparent that collaboration among trans-professionals is needed. This conference will bring together a multidisciplinary group of professionals to address cancer health disparities in Latinos on numerous fronts, from basic research on biological differences behind disparities to community-level interventions that aim to overcome barriers to cancer care and address the unique needs of Latino populations. This special conference will celebrate the advances researchers have made to date, and explore new frontiers and gaps in this emerging transdisciplinary field, bringing research on health disparities from bench to bedside to community. This conference will support the following aims:  • Promote collaboration among trans-professionals in addressing cancer health disparities  in Latinos;  • Discuss latest findings in the field, identify critical gaps in current knowledge, and  stimulate development of new research in cancer health disparities among Latinos; and  • Identify and publish the top 10 priorities of greatest significance to Latinos based on  discussions from the conference, as well as recommendations for a research agenda. Project Narrative Latinos represent the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the United States, and are also among the groups that experience profound health disparities as it relates to cancer. The proposed conference on “Advancing the Science of Cancer in Latinos” is in line with the NIH research priority of addressing health disparities experienced by racial and ethnic minorities and other medically underserved populations by disseminating and promoting research specific to Latinos. This conference will bring together a multidisciplinary group of professionals and foster discussions and collaborations to move the field forward and make progress in reducing and eliminating cancer health disparities among Latinos.",Advancing the Science of Cancer in Latinos,9471696,R13MD012457,"['Attention ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Institutes ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' United States ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Fostering ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' experience ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' medically underserved population ', ' medically underserved group ', ' medically disadvantaged population ', ' medically disadvantaged ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer care ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Health Sciences ', ' International ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' bench to bedside ', ' bench to clinic ', ' bench to bed side ', ' bench bedside ', ' bench bed side ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population based ', ' screening ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R13,2017,49935,0.10350566280036597
"Factors Associated with Reducing Diabetes-Related Disparities of Rural Latinos ABSTRACT Factors Associated with Reducing Diabetes-Related Disparities of Rural Latinos We propose a research study that would greatly expand the opportunity for students to be involved in research, contribute to their knowledge about the healthcare service needs of rural populations, and stimulate research at our university about healthcare for minority ethnic/racial rural populations, especially rural Latinos. The proposed study addresses the problem of health disparities among rural populations as a whole, and among rural Latino residents specifically. The U.S. Latino population is growing at a rapid pace. As a group, they are at a high risk for developing diabetes. Compared to other groups, they have high percentages of overweight or obesity, which are among the risk factors associated with Type 2 diabetes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). The complications of diabetes are serious and costly to the patient and the healthcare system as a whole. To date, little is known about the potential impact of Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs) on ethnic/racial disparities in healthcare (Pollack & Armstrong, 2011). Knowing how ACOs affect these disparities is particularly essential because some minority groups, such as Latinos, African Americans, and Native Americans, are more concentrated in rural areas (Institute of Medicine, 2005). We propose a longitudinal study, the purpose of which is to: 1) compare health disparities and patient outcomes of rural Latino older adult patients diagnosed with diabetes to their non-Latino White counterparts, and 2) ascertain the impact of ACO participation by rural primary care providers (along with other factors) on rural Latino older adult patients. The study has two goals: Aim 1: To measure the disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates between rural Latino older adult patients of Medicare ACOs and rural non-Latino White older adult patients, and Aim 2: To identify factors related to reduced disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates of rural Latino older adult patients, including RHC participation in a Medicare ACO. We will apply a pre-post design treating Medicare ACO participation as an intervention. The project will use data for a four-year period before the Medicare ACOs began (2008 - 2011) and a four-year period afterwards (2012 - 2015). The project will proceed in 3 major phases as follows: 1) collecting, merging, and organizing secondary data from multiple sources; 2) researching and constructing variables to include in the analyses; and 3) conducting univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses. The study will contribute to rural health research by adding to the knowledge about: 1) the factors that contribute to minimizing diabetes-related health disparities of rural Latino adults, 2) the diabetes preventive care effectiveness of ACOs, and 3) the types of ACOs most beneficial to rural Latino patients. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study addresses the problem of health disparities among rural populations as a whole, and among rural Latino residents specifically. Using a pre-post design that treats Medicare ACO participation as an intervention, we will measure the disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates between rural Latino older adult patients and rural non-Latino White older adult patients, and identify factors related to reduced disparities in diabetes-related hospitalization rates of rural Latino older adult patients, including Rural Health Clinic participation in a Medicare ACO.",Factors Associated with Reducing Diabetes-Related Disparities of Rural Latinos,9377877,R15MD011663,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Arts ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Economics ', ' Florida ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Multivariate Analysis ', ' Multivariate Analyses ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Health Centers ', ' rural health clinic ', ' Rural Population ', ' Science ', ' statistics ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Rural ', ' Research Activity ', ' Native Americans ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' health care service organization ', ' health care organization ', ' Performance ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' research study ', ' graduate student ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' rural disparities ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' rural Hispanic ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CENTRAL FLORIDA,R15,2017,424976,0.02021214894332541
"Sun Protection Barriers and Facilitators Scale (SP-BFS) for Latinos ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although skin cancer (SC) is a largely preventable disease, it is the most common cancer in the United States. More than 3 million skin cancers are diagnosed annually. The lifetime risk of developing melanoma (an aggressive form of skin cancer) is higher among whites, but this disease is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality in the Latino population. Compared with whites, Latinos have lower 5-year melanoma survival rates, especially among men (76.6% in Latinos vs. 87.0% in whites). The Latino population often presents late-stage melanoma tumors, which can cause detrimental prognoses. Many of the cases of SC that are diagnosed annually could be prevented by protecting the skin from excessive sun exposure. Latinos tend to report a lower frequency of sunscreen use, and to endorse more sun protection barriers. This group is more likely to believe that not much can be done to decrease the risk of SC and to agree that there are too many recommendation about preventing SC ""that it's hard to know which ones to follow"" when compared with whites. The long-term goal is to use a strong psychosocial measure on sun protection beliefs that can be used to better understand behavior and guide intervention development. The objective of this particular application is to apply a mixed methods approach to better assess psychosocial factors of sun protection in the Latino population, using the Health Belief Model (HBM) and the PEN-3 model of cultural influence as theoretical frameworks. The approach is innovative because it will develop a culturally sensitive, theory-based, and psychometrically strong measure of sun protection barriers and facilitators in English to assess sun protection beliefs in Latinos. In Aim 1, in-depth interviews will be conducted to collect qualitative and quantitative data using a sample of Latino adults (N=30) to create a pool of items reflecting sun protection barriers and facilitators. A cognitive interviewing session will follow u the first set of in-depth interviews (N=15), and the Sun Protection Barriers and Facilitators Scale (SP-BFS) will be developed based on information gathered in this aim. In Aim 2, the scale will be administered to a second sample of Latino adults (N=200) and it will be psychometrically examined (reliability and validity). The proposed research is significant because it will contribut to the limited literature regarding predictors of SC prevention in Latinos as a way to investigate mechanisms to improve health promotion actions. The proposed research supports NCI's goal to identify and understand factors that contribute to disparities in the incidence and mortality of cancer, and for research to help develop appropriate initiatives that are culturally relevant. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At the conclusion of the award, we will have fulfilled the essential public health need for a culturally sensitive, psychometrically strong sun protection barriers and facilitators scale (SP- BFS). This scale will allow us to measure psychosocial factors that might predict and influence the likelihood to engage in sun protective behaviors in the Latino population. The information gained by the development of this scale will improve the assessment, development, and informed dissemination of prevention and control efforts for the decrease of skin cancer morbidity and mortality disparities.",Sun Protection Barriers and Facilitators Scale (SP-BFS) for Latinos,9226011,R03CA195039,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' malignant skin tumor ', ' Malignant Skin Neoplasm ', ' Skin Cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Darkness ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' melanoma ', ' Malignant Melanoma ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Perception ', ' Protective Clothing ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Validity and Reliability ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Sunbathing ', ' Sunscreening Agents ', ' Sunscreens ', ' Sunblock ', ' Survival Rate ', ' Testing ', ' Ulceration ', ' Ulcer ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Melanoma Skin ', ' Malignant Melanoma of Skin ', ' Malignant Cutaneous Melanoma ', ' Cutaneous Melanoma ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Individual ', ' Dermatologist ', ' Prevent skin cancer ', ' skin cancer prevention ', ' Skin tanning ', ' Tanning ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' The Sun ', ' sun ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Frequencies ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Sun protection factor ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Skin ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Sun Exposure ', ' sunlight exposure ', ' solar exposure ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Cognitive ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' sun protection ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' protective behavior ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' tumor ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' ']",NCI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R03,2017,84750,0.18282726256776607
"Tailoring of Childhood Obesity Screening and Counseling for Latino Families with Preschool-Aged Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application for a K23 award for a fellowship trained pediatrician specializing in Pediatric Nutrition and childhood obesity. The candidate is committed to an academic career as a physician scientist conducting patient-oriented research in childhood obesity. This award will support the candidate's training and attainment of expertise in three areas: qualitative research methods, cultural tailoring of technology-based interventions, and implementation science. This training will support his overall goals of designing and rigorously testing childhood obesity interventions that can be readily translated and disseminated and that will provide critical insight for care in diverse settings and patient groups. To achieve these goals, Dr. Haemer has assembled a cross-disciplinary mentoring team, each with outstanding experience in research methods and strong records of successful mentoring: Dr. Glasgow, a behavioral scientist who is renown within the field of implementation science; Dr. Bull, an expert researcher in technology-based health promotion; and Dr. Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition specialist with extensive research and clinical experience in childhood obesity and with a long history of mentoring young investigators. The proposed research addresses the huge knowledge gap in cost-effective ways for the healthcare system to influence both patient-level and population-level outcomes for childhood obesity. Evidence-based approaches of surveillance, screening, prevention and treatment largely remain uncertain or untested, especially for the youngest children from groups at highest risk of obesity-related health disparity. This K23 award will study methods for prevention and treatment applied to Latino preschool-aged children from low- income families. The research will test the central hypothesis that culturally tailored screening and counseling will be more effective at decreasing BMI trajectory than usual care. Specific aims include: 1. To characterize components of primary care interactions that should be culturally tailored to enhance motivation for healthy lifestyle change among Latino parents with preschoolers 2. To design a technology-user interface that maximizes acceptance by Latino parents of young children. 3. To pilot test a technology-supported screening and counseling protocol tailored to Latino parents using findings of Aims 1 and 2. Using an implementation science perspective, we will assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation fidelity, and sustainable maintenance of the intervention in clinical practice during the pilot RCT. This research and training will form the basis for an RO1 proposal to test technology-supported childhood obesity prevention and treatment interventions targeting young children from low-income Latino families.

"Participatory Trial of a Health Promoting School Approach to Positive Youth Development and Wellness Promotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The overarching goal of this study is to address key adolescent health issues (substance use, emotional well-being, developmental assets) and critical social determinants of health (academic engagement and achievement) for all students, but 9th grade youth of Latino, Hmong, Somali and other African heritage in particular, through a focus on student-school connectedness and the school environment. The school environment, including student-teacher relationships and opportunities for meaningful student participation, establishes student connectedness, leading to multiple health-protective outcomes. However youth of color often express less connection to school. Health Promoting Schools' interventions may improve connectedness by addressing 3 components: 1) classroom wellbeing topics/approaches, 2) school environment or ethos, 3) links with families and/or communities. We will build on a NIMHD (R24MD00766-01)-funded pilot that developed and evaluated Project TRUST (Training for Resiliency in Urban Students and Teachers), an intervention to support teachers in improving relationships with, and promoting PYD for Somali, Latino, and Hmong 9th grade youth. Core partners Somali, Latino and Hmong Partnership for Health and Wellness (SoLaHmo), University of Minnesota Program in Health Disparities Research and College of Education and Human Development along with teachers, parents, and youth co-developed and piloted the intervention. Findings suggest that Project TRUST is feasible and acceptable to educators and may improve youth educational engagement, emotional well-being, and developmental assets across race/ethnic groups. Findings identified the need for broader improvements in the school environment and involvement with parents to substantively improve connectedness. In the current proposal we will expand our CBPR Coalition to co-direct refinement and implementation of a multi- component Health Promoting Schools intervention including: 1) pilot-tested teacher professional development, 2) student- defined enhanced environment, and 3) parent-defined enhanced community/family connection. The Coalition will finalize the intervention using a phased intervention map that integrates community perspectives with theoretical approaches to PYD and evidence based practices. The study aims will be accomplished through a group randomized trial in 10 urban schools with diverse populations representing approximately 1,900 students. Study aims are: Aim 1: Assess the effects of a school-based multi-component intervention on improved school connectedness, school engagement, and developmental assets through a group randomized, participatory trial. Aim 2: Assess the effects of a health promoting schools multi-component intervention on emotional well-being, tobacco and other substance use, and academic outcomes through a group randomized, participatory trial. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationships between participatory factors (CBPR collaborative processes, capacities, and contextual factors), school intervention implementation, and study outcomes. The focus on school connectedness and environment as key proximal social determinants of health and promising intervention targets is innovative while the CBPR approach assures project success and sustainability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of our study is to use a community based participatory research approach to implement and evaluate a multi-component school-based intervention to enhance emotional well-being and academic achievement, and prevent tobacco and other substance use through the promotion of student-school connectedness for all students, but Latino, Hmong, Somali and other African heritage 9th grade youth in particular. We will build on a NIMHD -funded pilot that developed and evaluated Project TRUST (Training for Resiliency in Urban Students and Teachers), an intervention to support teachers in improving relationships with, and promoting positive youth development for Somali, Latino, and Hmong 9th grade youth.

"Exito Latino Cancer Research Leadership Training ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer has overtaken heart disease as the top Latino killer; however few Latinos seek doctoral degrees and enter the field of cancer control research, particularly in the behavioral sciences. In response, Éxito! Latino Cancer Research Leadership Training, was launched in 2010 by the Institute for Health Promotion Research (IHPR) at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) with the long-term goal of increasing the number of master's-level students and master's trained health professionals entering - and completing - doctoral programs and focusing their careers on cancer control research among Latinos. For the proposed second funding cycle, the Éxito! program will continue to recruit an annual cohort of participants from across the U.S. and provide them with support along the pipeline from master's to doctoral level training. The five aims to accomplish our overarching goal are to: 1) conduct an annual five-day summer institute for 25 participants; 2) award up to 10 annual paid summer internships in Latino cancer control research; 3) promote retention throughout the graduate pipeline with web-based academic support and career-building opportunities that include peer-to-peer professional support, interactive online communication forums, and facilitated connections to pre-and post-doctoral programs; 4) achieve doctoral enrollment rate of 30% or more, at most 15% doctoral-student attrition, and at least 50% of doctoral students conducting cancer control research; and 5) develop and implement active and passive dissemination plans by sharing the program with at least two Hispanic Serving Institutions and presenting project findings at professional meetings and in peer- reviewed literature. Program evaluation will include process, impact, and outcome measurements to monitor participant's academic progress as well as the influence of the Éxito! program on intention and efficacy regarding pursuit of the doctorate and career in cancer research. The Éxito! program continues to align well with the mission of the IHPR, which is ""to research the causes and solutions to the unequal impact of cancer and chronic disease affecting residents of South Texas and the nation to improve the health of all people while serving as a national model for health promotion research and education."" Further, the Éxito! program complements other UTHSCSA-wide federally-funded training programs as the only Latino training program focused on doctoral-level preparation in the social, behavioral and public health sciences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Americans of Latino descent are affected by cancer at a higher rate than other groups, however they are underrepresented in doctoral programs and careers in cancer control research.

"Trauma-Informed Prevention to Address Violence and Related Disparities for Latino Youth Project Summary This project uses Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR), and community health workers (promotoras) and youth mentors as prevention program facilitators, to address health disparities related to violence exposure among Latino youth. An important objective of the proposal is to address a significant gap in prevention science and health disparities research, by piloting a multi-level family-focused intervention which uses a low cost, culturally attentive, parent-youth engagement strategy focused on adapting an empirically supported Latina parent training program, and incorporating a trauma-informed approach to prevent violence and related health disparities among Latino youth. The specific aims are to: (1) Combine effective prevention programs to gain potential additive/multiplicative effects of serving both parents and youth using a trauma- informed, culturally appropriate, low cost approach; (2) Evaluate program feasibility and acceptability; and (3) Evaluate program effects. To accomplish these aims, we will build upon and strengthen existing collaborations with academic, community-based organizations, and community members, that we have developed during our Phase 1 planning grant. We will continue to use a CBPR approach to build upon community strengths and existing resources, increase engagement and participation, facilitate the reciprocal exchange of knowledge and understanding, and empower community members to engage in social change that improves their lives. Project activities will be implemented under the guidance of a Community Advisory Board, and a network of promotoras who will inform adaptations to the program using a reciprocal and iterative process. A controlled pilot will be used to evaluate the program. Weekly satisfaction ratings, attrition, and attendance will help to assess feasibility and acceptability of the program. Trajectories towards externalizing and internalizing disorders, along with improvements in positive parenting skills, family functioning, youth resilience, deviant peer associations, and youth coping self-efficacy will be examined. Discerning the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and ultimately the uptake of this prevention approach will serve as the foundation to launch a larger prevention trial. This project provides a unique opportunity, with deeply invested Latino and Latino- serving community partners, to advance the field in addressing health disparities, and may well have significant scientific implications for the prevention and treatment of trauma and violence among Latino youth. Project Narrative Violence exposure poses a major problem for Latino youth in the United States. Violence exposure and its negative health and mental health sequelae represent a racial disparity, occurring at disproportionately higher rates among Latino youth when compared with their non-Hispanic White counterparts. An important objective of the proposal is to address a significant gap in prevention science and health disparities research, by utilizing community-based participatory research to develop and pilot a low cost, culturally attentive, parent-youth engagement strategy facilitated by promotoras and youth mentors.

"Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO This application proposes an interdisciplinary Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO), with the unifying theme of conducting and promoting multi-level community-based participatory research to prevent SAVA syndemic conditions (substance abuse, violence/trauma and HIV/AIDS) and reduce their adverse health and mental health consequences. The emphasis of the Center will be on tailored interventions for Latino subgroups who represent pockets of vulnerability and require precise and specialized interventions that optimize access to and impact of interventions. CLaRO will unite and advance the work undertaken during the past decade by two NIMHD Centers of Excellence: the P60 Center of Excellence for Health Disparities Research (El Centro), at the University of Miami (UM), and the P20 Center of Excellence within the Center for Research on US Latino HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse (CRUSADA), at Florida International University (FIU). Both originating centers have well-established research infrastructures and strong records of achievement in translating research findings into meaningful, culturally relevant clinical practice for vulnerable Latinos. In this application, we propose two behavioral intervention studies, each of which advances the work of the existing collaborating Centers of Excellence. Research Project 1 will develop a culturally tailored intervention directed at preventing and reducing SAVA conditions among seasonal farmworker men and will be packaged, in collaboration with the Community/Scientific Advisory Board (CSAB), for community dissemination. Research Project 2 adapts and tests an intervention, developed at El Centro, for preventing and reducing self-harm and other SAVA-related behaviors in Latina and sexual/gender minority youth. The two Research Projects will be integrated through a common set of data points to measure risk and protective factors, moderators, and SAVA indicators related to the CLaRO theme. The common data elements will be expanded as CLaRO evolves to include biological and community-level measures. This application leverages the success of the originating Centers of Excellence and considerable institutional resources to advance investigator development at the applicant institution (UM). We propose a Pilot Projects Program, which will be articulated with scientific resources, training and mentorship, and will fund up to 35 studies, serving as an engine for the advancement of early-stage investigators and for diversifying the workforce of successful health disparities investigators. The CLaRO theme, agenda, and priorities were developed in collaboration with a network of community partners who will play an ongoing role in guiding and disseminating CLaRO science and advancing neighborhood capacity building and multilevel interventions to promote health in Latino communities. Miami-Dade County— with its large and diverse Latino population, who face individual, social and structural risk factors and have high prevalence of substance abuse, HIV and violence/trauma—provides the ideal laboratory for advancing the science of Latino health and health disparities. The proposed Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities: CLaRO, will conduct and promote research to advance interventions tailored for Latino groups who experience the greatest health risks, such as seasonal farmworkers, sexual/gender minority individuals and youth. The focus will be on community-based interventions that can have the greatest impact by addressing the root causes of the intertwined health conditions of substance abuse, violence/trauma, and HIV/AIDS. CLaRO will also contribute to the reduction and eventual elimination of health disparities by training, mentoring, and supporting the next generation of health disparities scientists. ",Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO,9484588,U54MD002266,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Family Research ', ' Florida ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' member ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' TIM1 ', ' P60 ', ' GEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Common Data Element ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' systems research ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' next generation ', ' Trauma ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,U54,2017,1422631,0.09434028897458971
"ADAPTING AND ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF ‘HEALTHY DADS, HEALTHY KIDS’ FOR US LATINOS Project Summary Latinos in the United States face health disparities for obesity and related medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Targeting families to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors has been identified as an effective strategy to prevent obesity. With the importance of familism (family cohesion) among Latino population, a family based intervention is especially desirable as an engaging strategy to promote behaviors that support a healthy weight status and decrease obesity related health disparities for Latinos. Emerging evidence supports the need to include and target fathers in family based lifestyle behavior interventions. However, to date primarily mothers have been reached by such efforts in the US. Health Dads Healthy Kids (HDHK) is an evidence based program developed in Australia, shown to have significant weight and behavior treatment effects for fathers and their children, compared to controls. The HDHK program is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Family Systems Theory and aims to promote increased physical activity and improved dietary intake. An important innovation in the program is that fathers and children attend together and are both targeted as agents of behavior change for each other (reciprocal reinforcement) and to participate in fun, family activities together. HDHK has several features that may appeal to Latino families: it is delivered in group sessions by a trained facilitator from the community (collectivism), and it promotes paternal role- modeling (enforces respeto), family cohesion, and engagement together in lifestyle behaviors (familism). How- ever, HDHK should be systematically culturally adapted for Latino families to ensure appropriate enrollment, engagement and promotion of desired health outcomes for Latino families, prior to further evaluation. We propose to convene a panel of Latino fathers and mothers from the community to serve as key informants; and an expert panel of researchers with experience in culturally adapting parenting interventions for Latinos, Latino lifestyle behaviors, and the influence of Latino fathers. The two panels will work with the study team (including the developer of HDHK) to systematically modify the HDHK program to culturally adapt it for Latino families following the Ecological Validity Model. They will also inform the selection of items from established item banks of food and physical activity parenting. The resulting scales will be tested among a sample of Latino fathers to establish validated scales of parenting for Latino fathers, which is expected to be a mediator of children's behavior change in HDHK, and will be needed in the future trial. The resulting Latino-HDHK will be tested for feasibility (as measured by retention, engagement, and satisfaction), in a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=40). The pilot study will include a thorough process evaluation, including exit interviews with participating Latino fathers and their co-parent (typically mothers). Once completed, this developmental study will position us to apply for a future R01 to assess the Latino-HDHK in a fully powered randomized controlled trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latino adults and children experience health disparities for overweight and obesity-related medical conditions, and therefore family level obesity prevention programs for Latino populations are urgently needed. `Health Dads Healthy Kids' is the first program to primarily target fathers for obesity prevention for themselves and their children, with significant and clinically relevant treatment effects. We propose to systematically culturally adapt `Healthy Dads Healthy Kids' for Latino families and test the feasibility of the program among a community sample of Latino families.","ADAPTING AND

"Culturally Competent Communication Intervention to Improve Latinos' Engagement in Advance Care Planning PROJECT SUMMARY Compared to whites, Latinos are much less likely to engage in various forms of advance care planning (ACP), including completing advance directives and having end-of-life (EOL) discussions. ACP is critical to provision of quality EOL care, as it has been associated with greater likelihood of patients' EOL wishes being followed. Latino advanced cancer patients are also significantly more likely than their white counterparts to receive futile and burdensome aggressive care at the end-of-life, to die in the ICU, and to have care that runs counter to their preferences and values. Dr. Shen's pilot work, along with the current literature, suggests that targeting ACP may help improve Latinos' EOL care. As such, the proposed project will develop and pilot-test a culturally competent communication (CCC) intervention. First, the CCC intervention will be developed based on results from a questionnaire embedded into a current R01 (MPIs: Prigerson, Maciejewski) assessing Latinos' cultural, familial, and religious beliefs as well as their knowledge, motivation (readiness), and action to engage in ACP (n=200). Next, the developed CCC intervention will be vetted among Latino stakeholders and field-tested among Latino advanced cancer patients, using an iterative approach (n=40) to guide the finalization of the intervention. Finally, a pilot randomized trial will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the CCC intervention at improving engagement in ACP. Participants (n=50) will be randomly assigned to the intervention (n=25) or attention control group (n=25). Results will provide timely insight into a potentially effective, low burden intervention designed to improve Latinos' engagement in ACP. Dr. Shen is the ideal candidate to spearhead this line of research given her academic background in social psychology and communication research. Dr. Shen's long-term career goal is to lead a program of social scientific research that develops social psychological interventions designed to improve EOL communication and care, with expertise in interventions targeting racial/ethnic minorities. To achieve this goal, as part of her K07, Dr. Shen will receive intensive training in five key areas: (1) EOL care research; (2) clinical intervention development; (3) technology-based health interventions; (4) health disparities, and (5) professional development. The K07 will provide Dr. Shen with several avenues to achieve her training and research goals and enhance her expertise. Dr. Shen will have ongoing meetings with mentors and expert advisors and participate in formal coursework, didactics, workshops, conferences, interactive trainings, and guided research experience. The proposed K07 will form the foundation for a program of research that focuses on developing social psychological interventions to improve EOL communication and care. At the end of the K07 funding period, Dr. Shen will submit an R01 application, based on the results of the present study. Overall, the K07 will provide Dr. Shen with the research experience, intensive training, and mentorship needed to become a successful independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has significant public health relevance and is consistent with the broader goals of public health focuses on improving communication regarding end-of-life care. The development of a Culturally Competent Communication Intervention designed to coach Latino advanced cancer patients in how to communicate EOL goals of care in order to improve their engagement in advance care planning will help reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in advance care planning and potentially end-of-life care. If the Culturally Competent Communication Intervention proves to be potentially efficacious, there is a strong argument for testing this intervention in a larger, multi-site study to test for effectiveness.",Culturally Competent Communication Intervention to Improve Latinos' Engagement in Advance Care Planning,9314728,K07CA207580,"['advanced directive ', ' Advance Directives ', ' Belief ', ' Communication ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Proxy ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' end of life care ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Dominican ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Communication Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' social communication ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' end-of-life communication ', ' end of life communication ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' attentional control ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' ']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K07,2017,172260,0.13521113534248588
"Preventing Diabetes in Latino Youth Project Summary / Abstract:  Obesity and related health disparities represent some of the most significant public health challenges facing society. In particular, obese Latino adolescents are disproportionately impacted by insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is an intermediate stage in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and represents a critical opportunity for intervention. The Diabetes Prevention Program established that lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes. To date, no diabetes prevention studies have been conducted in obese Latino youth with prediabetes, a highly vulnerable and underserved group. Therefore, we propose a randomized-controlled trial to test the short-term (6-month) and long-term (12- month) efficacy of a culturally-grounded, lifestyle intervention, as compared to usual care, for improving glucose tolerance and reducing diabetes risk in 120 obese Latino adolescents with prediabetes. We will further test intervention effects on quality of life, explore the potential mediating effects of changes in total, regional, and organ fat on improving glucose tolerance and increasing insulin sensitivity, and estimate the initial incremental cost-effectiveness of the intervention as compared with usual care for improving glucose tolerance. The overall approach is framed within a multilevel Ecodevelopmental model that leverages community, family, peer, and individual factors during the critical transition period of adolescence when changes in health behaviors and health outcomes are linked to future health trajectories. The intervention is guided by Social Cognitive Theory and employs key behavioral modification strategies to enhance self-efficacy and foster social support for making and sustaining healthy behavior changes. The proposal builds upon extant collaborations of a transdisciplinary team of investigators working in concert with local community agencies to address critical gaps in how diabetes prevention interventions for obese Latino youth are developed, implemented and evaluated. This innovative approach is an essential step in the development of scalable, cost-effective, solution-oriented programs to prevent type 2 diabetes in this and other populations of high-risk youth. Public Health Relevance: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are critical public health issues in youth. This study will test the effects and estimate the cost-effectiveness of a culturally-grounded community-based lifestyle intervention on type 2 diabetes risk among obese Latino adolescents with prediabetes.",Preventing Diabetes in Latino Youth,9692214,R01DK107579,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"Tu Salud Si Cuenta!  Reaching Latino family dyads to increase physical activity and healthy eating Abstract(extracted from the parent grant, 1R01HL128705-01, 1R56HL128705-01) Most adults in the U.S. fail to meet national physical activity (PA) and dietary recommendations, and Latinos are less likely to meet these recommendations than non-Latino Whites. Physical inactivity, a poor diet, and obesity are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and stroke and are important contributors to preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Social environments are widely recognized to have an important impact on these behaviors, yet most behavior change programs give limited attention to the social contexts in which behaviors occur. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month, community-based family dyad intervention in promoting engagement in and maintenance of PA and healthy eating among Latino adults residing in three predominantly Latino communities in Houston, TX. Dyads will be randomly assigned to a community health worker (CHW)-led intervention, “Tu Salud, ¡Si Cuenta! – Familiar” (TSSC-Family) or to a contact control condition focused on healthy homes. TSSC-Family will consist of six home visits delivered to dyad members over a six-month period to build behavioral skills and social support for sustained healthy behavior change among Latino family dyads. The healthy homes contact control will also consist of six monthly visits delivered to dyad members by a CHW. Study participants will include 552 Latino adults not currently meeting PA or nutrition recommendations recruited and enrolled as family member dyads (n=276 dyads). This approach expands on an empirically- based motivational behavior change intervention developed by a member of the investigative team in collaboration with community partners that has shown preliminary evidence of effectiveness for positive PA and dietary behavior change in Latino individuals. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after baseline to evaluate both intermediate and long-term effects. Primary outcomes include minutes per week of moderate and vigorous PA, and servings of fruits and vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, and whole grains. Weight loss is a secondary outcome. Self-efficacy, stage of change, social support, and social control will also be examined as potential mediators of changes in PA and nutrition. The proposed research is innovative in its use of a novel intervention that emphasizes dyadic social processes in addition to standard behavior change strategies. The intervention explicitly targets family-based social networks to foster social environments supportive of healthy behavior change using CHWs to facilitate home-based outreach and communication to this understudied population. This research is expected to yield critical insight regarding effective approaches for increasing PA and healthy eating among Latinos, the largest and among the fastest growing minority groups in the U.S. Narrative (extracted from parent grant,1R01HL128705-01, 1R56HL128705-01) The proposed research seeks to address Latino health disparities in chronic disease risk by evaluating a novel intervention focused on motivation, behavior skills, and family social contexts to increase physical activity and healthy eating in Latino adults. The community-engaged research approach and the use of community health workers to deliver the intervention builds community capacity and enhances the potential to effectively address health disparities. Results will yield critical information regarding effective community-based intervention approaches and facilitate understanding of how this type of intervention can work in real-world settings.",Tu Salud Si Cuenta!

"Apoyo Con Carino: Patient Navigation to Improve Palliative Care for Seriously Ill Latinos Project Summary Latinos are more likely to experience uncontrolled pain, institutional death, and are less likely to engage in advance care planning. Efforts to increase access to palliative care must maximize primary palliative care and community based models to meet the ever growing need in a culturally-sensitive and congruent manner. Patient navigator interventions are community based, culturally tailored models of care and have been successfully implemented to improve disease prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. We have developed and implemented a patient navigation intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for seriously ill hospitalized Latinos. We have demonstrated feasibility and early findings suggest this intervention can improve palliative care outcomes for Latinos with advanced cancer. Building on this prior research, we propose a fully powered randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of the manualized patient navigator intervention in a non-cancer population. A total of 240 Latino adults with non-cancer, advanced medical illness enrolled from 8 urban and 4 rural clinical sites will be randomized to the intervention group (5 palliative care-related patient navigator visits plus educational materials) or control group (usual care plus educational materials). Participants randomized to the intervention group will demonstrate better quality of life, will be more likely to have a palliative approach to their care, have higher rates of advance care planning, better pain and symptom control, and higher rates of hospice utilization compared to the control group). We will conduct a cost analysis of the patient navigator intervention by comparing direct costs of the intervention and cost and utilization of health care system resources across the study arms. Participants randomized to the intervention will have lower costs in the 6 months following study enrollment compared to participants in the control arm. Decedent participants randomized to the intervention will have lower costs in the last 3 months of life compared to decedent participants in the control arm. For the intervention visits, bicultural, bilingual navigators (guias) integrate core Latino values, while addressing barriers to a palliative approach through education, culturally tailored messaging, and patient activation. Patients will be interviewed at baseline and 3 months using the QUAL- E quality of life scale, Brief Pain Inventory, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and the Patient Navigator Process and Outcomes Measure. Medical records will be reviewed to assess advance directive completion, hospice and health care utilization and intensity of care at the end of life. This culturally tailored, evidence-based, theory driven, highly innovative patient navigation intervention has significant potential to improve palliative care for Latinos, and facilitate true health equity in palliative and end of life care. PROJECT NARATIVE Palliative care is a priority area of focus for the National Institute of Nursing Research. Despite the evidence- based benefits of palliative care, access remains limited, especially in poor urban and rural settings. Cultural and linguistic barriers may also increase disparities in palliative care for Latinos. Due to a nationwide shortage of palliative care providers and the unique cultural preferences and values of patients, our innovative study has the potential to improve palliative care outcomes and reduce health disparities in both urban and rural underserved communities.",Apoyo Con Carino: Patient Navigation to Improve Palliative Care for Seriously Ill Latinos,9535484,R01NR016467,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost Benefit Analyses ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Medical Records ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Publishing ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' care preference ', ' clinical site ', ' clinical research site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' tailored messaging ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' health equity ', ' arm ', ' two-arm study ', ' screening ', ' improved outcome ', ' navigator intervention ', ' painful symptom ', ' pain symptom ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' rural underserved ', ' urban underserved ', ' urban setting ', ' rural setting ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' intervention cost ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2018,560506,0.03510580889744316
"Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO This application proposes an interdisciplinary Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO), with the unifying theme of conducting and promoting multi-level community-based participatory research to prevent SAVA syndemic conditions (substance abuse, violence/trauma and HIV/AIDS) and reduce their adverse health and mental health consequences. The emphasis of the Center will be on tailored interventions for Latino subgroups who represent pockets of vulnerability and require precise and specialized interventions that optimize access to and impact of interventions. CLaRO will unite and advance the work undertaken during the past decade by two NIMHD Centers of Excellence: the P60 Center of Excellence for Health Disparities Research (El Centro), at the University of Miami (UM), and the P20 Center of Excellence within the Center for Research on US Latino HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse (CRUSADA), at Florida International University (FIU). Both originating centers have well-established research infrastructures and strong records of achievement in translating research findings into meaningful, culturally relevant clinical practice for vulnerable Latinos. In this application, we propose two behavioral intervention studies, each of which advances the work of the existing collaborating Centers of Excellence. Research Project 1 will develop a culturally tailored intervention directed at preventing and reducing SAVA conditions among seasonal farmworker men and will be packaged, in collaboration with the Community/Scientific Advisory Board (CSAB), for community dissemination. Research Project 2 adapts and tests an intervention, developed at El Centro, for preventing and reducing self-harm and other SAVA-related behaviors in Latina and sexual/gender minority youth. The two Research Projects will be integrated through a common set of data points to measure risk and protective factors, moderators, and SAVA indicators related to the CLaRO theme. The common data elements will be expanded as CLaRO evolves to include biological and community-level measures. This application leverages the success of the originating Centers of Excellence and considerable institutional resources to advance investigator development at the applicant institution (UM). We propose a Pilot Projects Program, which will be articulated with scientific resources, training and mentorship, and will fund up to 35 studies, serving as an engine for the advancement of early-stage investigators and for diversifying the workforce of successful health disparities investigators. The CLaRO theme, agenda, and priorities were developed in collaboration with a network of community partners who will play an ongoing role in guiding and disseminating CLaRO science and advancing neighborhood capacity building and multilevel interventions to promote health in Latino communities. Miami-Dade County— with its large and diverse Latino population, who face individual, social and structural risk factors and have high prevalence of substance abuse, HIV and violence/trauma—provides the ideal laboratory for advancing the science of Latino health and health disparities. The proposed Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities: CLaRO, will conduct and promote research to advance interventions tailored for Latino groups who experience the greatest health risks, such as seasonal farmworkers, sexual/gender minority individuals and youth. The focus will be on community-based interventions that can have the greatest impact by addressing the root causes of the intertwined health conditions of substance abuse, violence/trauma, and HIV/AIDS. CLaRO will also contribute to the reduction and eventual elimination of health disparities by training, mentoring, and supporting the next generation of health disparities scientists. ",Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO,9571033,U54MD002266,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Family Research ', ' Florida ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' member ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' TIM1 ', ' P60 ', ' GEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Common Data Element ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' systems research ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' next generation ', ' Trauma ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' stem ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' service coordination ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,U54,2018,2326375,0.09434028897458971
"Physical Activity in Latino Men Through Tailoring: Hombres Saludables ABSTRACT Physical inactivity is a physical inactivity than risk factor for many important chronic diseases. Latino men report higher rates of non-Latinos, are less likely to meet PA guidelines and are disproportionately affected by PA-related health conditions, such as obesity and diabetes. Most Latino PA interventions have focused on women; the vast majority excluded men and none specifically targeted men. Moreover interventions that included men focused mostly on Mexican American only. Thus, there is an urgent need for effective PA interventions with diverse populations of Latino men. NIH has specifically called for research studies to focus on the development and testing of culturally appropriate health-promoting interventions to reduce health disparities among racially and ethnically diverse men. Our research team has 25 years of experience developing, implementing and evaluating individually tailored, theory-based, computer-driven PA interventions including `Seamos Saludables' (in RI) and `Pasos' (in CA), culturally and linguistically adapted, individually- tailored print (Seamos) and web-based (Pasos) interventions for a diverse population of sedentary Latina women that were successful in increasing PA in Latina women. We then conducted formative interviews with Latino men, which confirmed that an intervention would be well-received by them. However, substantial content modifications were needed, so we adapted the print intervention and tested it in a demonstration trial with 10 Mexican American men. After 12 weeks, participants reported a significant increase (p=.03) in mean minutes of PA from 1.50 min/week at baseline to 125.70 min/week at 12 weeks with 100% retention and expressed enthusiasm for the program. However, less than half of the men achieved the PA guidelines of 150 minutes/week. Thus, further enhancements appear to be needed. Follow-up interviews indicated that the intervention was well received, but the men felt that they needed greater accountability, more contact with staff and other participants, briefer and more frequent information, more updates on PA opportunities, and ideas for addressing environmental barriers. The men specifically mentioned interest in web and/or text-based interventions to meet these needs. Thus, we will conduct formative research with a diverse population of Latino men in RI to inform the adaptation of the Pasos web-based intervention that was developed for Latina women, enhance it with new cell phone/text-based intervention components, and ensure that it is culturally appropriate for Latino men of Caribbean, South and Central American origin. We will then conduct a pilot study to evaluate its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy with a diverse population of Latino men in RI. In the pilot study, we will also explore potential moderators of treatment effects including demographics, acculturation, and environmental variables such as the neighborhood built, social and economic environments. The results of this pilot study will inform a future randomized controlled trial with Latino men to increase PA. Public Health Relevance Latino men report particularly low rates of physical activity (PA) and are disproportionately burdened by health conditions related to sedentary lifestyle. The proposed research will build on a series of previous successful studies to develop an individually tailored intervention using a combination of web and texting that is culturally and linguistically appropriate for a diverse population of Latino men and addresses their PA barriers and preferences. We will conduct focus groups with a diverse population of Latino men to ensure that the intervention is culturally appropriate for Latino men of Caribbean, South and Central American origin and to adapt/develop the new intervention components. Then we will evaluate the intervention's feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in a pilot study with 50 diverse Latino men.",Physical Activity in Latino Men Through Tailoring: Hombres Saludables,9522838,R34HL128067,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Computers ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Counseling ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Expert Systems ', ' Intelligent systems ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Gender Role ', ' Sex Roles ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Modernization ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Perception ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Accountability ', ' Gender ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' sedentary ', ' Series ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Central American ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' programs ', ' South American ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' interest ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Participant ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' Update ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Population ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' treatment effect ', ' tailored messaging ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' arm ', ' Sedentary life-style ', ' Sedentary behavior ', ' sedentary lifestyle ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' recruit ', ' Text Messaging ', ' intervention arm ', ' treatment arm ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT STORRS,R34,2018,200152,0.033228369510563946
"Pre- to Post-Immigration Drinking and Driving among Recent Latino Immigrants: Examining Opportunities for Intervention Abstract  It has been posited that recent Latino immigrants may be at higher risk for involvement with driving while impaired (DWI) due to a failure of fully understanding the risks associated with DWI as a result of cultural norms from their countries of origin, including lax enforcement of DWI laws. Yet, the literature shows that, in general, Latino immigrants are less likely to drive while impaired than their U.S.-born counterparts, albeit DWI rates vary sharply by country of origin. Beyond these broad results, there is a scarcity of knowledge regarding the drinking and driving trajectories of recent Latino immigrants. A preliminary study conducted by this research team examined drinking and driving behaviors in a sample of Latino immigrants in Miami-Dade County, FL, approximately 7 years after immigration. Results indicated that compared to the most established immigrants in the sample (permanent residents), undocumented immigrants were less likely to understand DWI laws, more likely to binge drink, and less likely to perceive the associated risks. Despite such elevated risk factors, undocumented immigrants were less likely to be involved in DWI events than permanent residents, in part because of their desire to stay undetected by law officers, but largely because of their limited access to cars. Interestingly, our preliminary study found that riding with an impaired driver (RWID) was a rather prevalent risk even upon arrival. Given that it is not hindered by driving limitations, RWID constitutes a more immediate (and overlooked) risk for immigrants than DWI. Thus, our preliminary work suggests a picture in which Latino immigrants, despite some contributing risk factors, do not drive while impaired immediately after arriving to the country, but such behavior increases over time. Such a transition period offers an opportunity for early intervention to deter not only DWI but also RWID, as these behaviors are to some extent related. This application will begin examining this opportunity.  The proposed study will take advantage of the lessons learned from our cross-sectional exploratory study to provide a detailed examination of the DWI/RWID phenomena among recent Latino immigrants as they evolve from pre-immigration through their first 3 years in the United States. These initial years have been identified as a period of significant change and stress for immigrants that can determine future DWI/RWID outcomes. The ultimate goal of the study is to acquire a detailed understanding of the environmental, demographic, and sociocultural factors influencing the early adoption of DWI/RWID trajectories. This knowledge will be used to inform culturally relevant intervention strategies for preventing DWI/RWID in the target population. Project Narrative  The proposed research matches the NIAAA’s long-term commitment to addressing health disparities, as it will provide detailed epidemiologic information about patterns of driving while impaired (DWI) and riding with an impaired driver (RWID) among Latino immigrants in Miami-Dade County, FL. Relevant to the NIAAA mission and to public health, the proposed “epidemiological research will increase understanding of the nature and scope of these disparities and generate hypotheses for subsequent intervention research” (NIAAA, Health Disparities Research, http://www.niaaa.nih.gov/sites/default/files/disparitiesNIAAARes.pdf) aimed at preventing the adoption of DWI/RWID risk behaviors in the target population.",Pre- to Post-Immigration Drinking and Driving among Recent Latino Immigrants: Examining Opportunities for Intervention,9447572,R01AA025720,"['Adoption ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Immigration ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Laws ', ' Literature ', ' Mission ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Latino ', ' Law Enforcement Officers ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' base ', ' ethyl alcohol measurements ', ' ethanol measurement ', ' alcohol level ', ' ETOH level ', ' alcohol measurement ', ' Site ', ' Failure ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' cohort ', ' outreach ', ' drinking ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Sampling ', ' driving behavior ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' driving while impaired ', ' Impaired Driving ', ' impaired driving performance ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' drinking behavior ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' high risk ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIAAA,PACIFIC INSTITUTE FOR RES AND EVALUATION,R01,2018,481852,0.10086649072083802
"Culturally Competent Communication Intervention to Improve Latinos' Engagement in Advance Care Planning PROJECT SUMMARY Compared to whites, Latinos are much less likely to engage in various forms of advance care planning (ACP), including completing advance directives and having end-of-life (EOL) discussions. ACP is critical to provision of quality EOL care, as it has been associated with greater likelihood of patients' EOL wishes being followed. Latino advanced cancer patients are also significantly more likely than their white counterparts to receive futile and burdensome aggressive care at the end-of-life, to die in the ICU, and to have care that runs counter to their preferences and values. Dr. Shen's pilot work, along with the current literature, suggests that targeting ACP may help improve Latinos' EOL care. As such, the proposed project will develop and pilot-test a culturally competent communication (CCC) intervention. First, the CCC intervention will be developed based on results from a questionnaire embedded into a current R01 (MPIs: Prigerson, Maciejewski) assessing Latinos' cultural, familial, and religious beliefs as well as their knowledge, motivation (readiness), and action to engage in ACP (n=200). Next, the developed CCC intervention will be vetted among Latino stakeholders and field-tested among Latino advanced cancer patients, using an iterative approach (n=40) to guide the finalization of the intervention. Finally, a pilot randomized trial will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the CCC intervention at improving engagement in ACP. Participants (n=50) will be randomly assigned to the intervention (n=25) or attention control group (n=25). Results will provide timely insight into a potentially effective, low burden intervention designed to improve Latinos' engagement in ACP. Dr. Shen is the ideal candidate to spearhead this line of research given her academic background in social psychology and communication research. Dr. Shen's long-term career goal is to lead a program of social scientific research that develops social psychological interventions designed to improve EOL communication and care, with expertise in interventions targeting racial/ethnic minorities. To achieve this goal, as part of her K07, Dr. Shen will receive intensive training in five key areas: (1) EOL care research; (2) clinical intervention development; (3) technology-based health interventions; (4) health disparities, and (5) professional development. The K07 will provide Dr. Shen with several avenues to achieve her training and research goals and enhance her expertise. Dr. Shen will have ongoing meetings with mentors and expert advisors and participate in formal coursework, didactics, workshops, conferences, interactive trainings, and guided research experience. The proposed K07 will form the foundation for a program of research that focuses on developing social psychological interventions to improve EOL communication and care. At the end of the K07 funding period, Dr. Shen will submit an R01 application, based on the results of the present study. Overall, the K07 will provide Dr. Shen with the research experience, intensive training, and mentorship needed to become a successful independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has significant public health relevance and is consistent with the broader goals of public health focuses on improving communication regarding end-of-life care. The development of a Culturally Competent Communication Intervention designed to coach Latino advanced cancer patients in how to communicate EOL goals of care in order to improve their engagement in advance care planning will help reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in advance care planning and potentially end-of-life care.

"Self-regulation development and the transition to middle school Self-regulation and the transition to middle school  The transition from elementary to middle school often precipitates a downward spiral in academic performance characterized by declining grades, academic disengagement, and eventual high school drop-out. During this same period, risky behaviors such as substance abuse and sexual risk-taking increase. Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition. Disentangling the factors contributing to the academic success/failure of low-income African American and Latino youth requires viewing development as a complex developmental process with “intertwined developmental trajectories, social pathways, and social convoys” (Benner, 2011). For low-income African American and Latino youth in particular, it is important to consider the intersection of social class, culture, and ethnicity for children of color transitioning to middle school. Life course theory suggests that early life stress can have a cumulative effect on development. Accordingly, individual level vulnerabilities at multiple levels of the youth ecology (individual, family, school, and neighborhood) can be potentiated during times of exposure to additional normative stressors, such as developmental transition points. Minority youth from low-SES families not only experience difficulties associated with poverty but also cultural stress (e.g., assimilation, discrimination) which undermine their ability to face normative stressors such as transitioning into middle school.  We propose to follow a large cohort of low-income African American and Latino children first enrolled at age 2½ as part of the Dallas Preschool Readiness Project (DPReP) as they transition into middle school. DPReP participants have completed four waves of data collection that have included measures of emerging self- regulation skills, academic achievement, and behavior problems. By following this sample into middle school, we will characterize trajectories of self-regulation development to address the following primary aims: Aim 1. Examine how individual differences in trajectories of self-regulation development from 2½ years into  middle school are related to differences in academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school for  low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 2. Examine how the interrelated contexts of family, school and neighborhood contribute to the middle  school academic and behavioral adjustment of low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 3. Examine how the relation of family, school, and neighborhood contexts to academic and behavioral  adjustment in middle school is both mediated and moderated by self-regulation skills among low-  income African Americans and Latinos. Data collection methods will include home visits, phone interviews, teacher surveys, and classroom and neighborhood observations. Measures include child self-regulation, assessments of academic performance and social competence, family environment, classroom environment, teacher-child relationship, and neighborhood conditions. Analytic methods will include structural equations modeling, and latent differences models. Project Narrative The transition from elementary to middle school often precipitates a downward spiral in academic performance characterized by declining grades, academic disengagement, and eventual high school drop-out. Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition, and the stark race/ethnic disparities in high school graduation rates and educational attainment likely reflect its long- term consequences. Children with better self-regulation in early childhood display better academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school. In this study, we will follow a cohort of 365 low-income African American and Latino children originally enrolled at age 2½ and reassessed at age 3½, kindergarten, and first grade to conduct additional assessments in 4th through 7th grade to examine the role of self-regulation skills, family-level processes and neighborhood conditions in explaining academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school.",Self-regulation development and the transition to middle school,9534707,R01HD075311,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Buffers ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Social Class ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Assimilations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' analytical method ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Exposure to ', ' Complex ', ' first grade ', ' 1st grade ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' seventh grade ', ' 7th grade ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' kindergarten ', ' Readiness ', ' Preparedness ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' critical period ', ' early adolescence ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' Attainment Rate ', ' Graduation Rates ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnic identity ', ' early life stress ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2018,600991,0.050536777385074325
"Delaying Licensure: Latino Teens Riding with Impaired Drivers and Impaired Driving 7. PROJECT SUMMARY For U.S. Latinos, disparities exist in the areas of driving while intoxicated (DWI) arrests and fatal alcohol- related motor vehicle crashes. This is evident despite research showing that Latinos do not drink and drive more often than their Non-Latino White counterparts. Further, Latinos are more likely to ride as passengers in private vehicles and are at a higher risk of riding with an alcohol/drug impaired driver (RWI). This risk is high among Latino teens and young adults. Their high RWI rates are a major public health concern as RWI is known as an antecedent and strong predictor of future DWI. These findings prompt two critical questions, “How is it that Latino teens, despite driving less, and drinking and driving less than their Non-Latino White peers, are overrepresented in alcohol-related arrests and crashes as adults?” and “Can we develop interventions to stop such a risky development?” Understanding the pathways to RWI/DWI along the life course of adolescence into emerging adulthood would greatly inform the development of focused prevention policies and interventions. Currently, little is known about developmental pathways to RWI/DWI among Latinos teens. Adding to this void in knowledge are two recent salient secular trends that present a major challenge for youth; many teens are intentionally delaying driving licensure (DDL) until age 18 or later to avoid teen-driver safety restrictions required by state graduated driver licensing (GDL) laws (when 15-17 y/o can drive only with adult supervision and/or under restrictions for passengers/nighttime driving) and Latinos in early/mid-adolescence now have a higher prevalence of alcohol and drug use than their peers of other racial and ethnic groups. For those 18 y/o inexperienced drivers who DDL, they have greater risk of serious and fatal crash involvement, particularly if they choose to use alcohol and/or drugs. There is concern this problem is particularly severe among Latinos, a group with a relatively elevated number of 18 y/o with little or no driving experience. This fact coupled with the noted increased prevalence of alcohol and drug use in Latino teens further emphasizes the importance and need of our proposed research as it relates to disparities in DDL, RWI, DWI, and alcohol-related fatal crashes. Our ultimate long-term research goal is to develop interventions to address this disparate source of health risk. To do so, we first propose a robust analysis of very recent adolescent health data that will guide the initial steps toward advancing the understanding of the relationships between DDL/GDL/RWI/DWI and thoroughly informing a succeeding R01 application focused on design and implementation of an effective theory-driven multilevel intervention program. Using national longitudinal adolescent health and fatal crash data, we will examine individual, family, and social factors that may be contributing to DDL in Latino teens. Also, we will examine relationships between DDL and GDL and episodes of RWI/DWI as well as fatal crashes. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide pivotal epidemiological evidence to inform effective interventions that will save lives and eliminate related health disparities. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent research suggests that graduated driver licensing (GDL) laws have been disparate in their safety benefit among Latinos teens. We will rigorously examine factors that appear to be leading Latino teens to delay driving licensure (DDL), explore how these factors are influenced by GDL laws, and evaluate the contribution of these factors in Latino teens' high rates of riding with impaired drivers (RWI), as well as driving while impaired (DWI) and fatal crash involvement. Our research findings will advance the understanding of processes contributing to DDL, their influence on RWI/DWI, and provide new knowledge that will ultimately inform the development of effective interventions that will save lives and eliminate associated health disparities.",Delaying Licensure: Latino Teens Riding with Impaired Drivers and Impaired Driving,9599273,R21AA026346,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Laws ', ' Licensure ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' male ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Knowledge ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' drinking ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' risk perception ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Driving While Intoxicated ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Fatality rate ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Teenagers ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' driving while impaired ', ' Impaired Driving ', ' impaired driving performance ', ' teenage driving ', ' teen driving ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Impairment ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' health data ', ' social media ', ' adolescent health ', ' ']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2018,244685,0.17775315789752438
"Exito Latino Cancer Research Leadership Training ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer has overtaken heart disease as the top Latino killer; however few Latinos seek doctoral degrees and enter the field of cancer control research, particularly in the behavioral sciences. In response, Éxito! Latino Cancer Research Leadership Training, was launched in 2010 by the Institute for Health Promotion Research (IHPR) at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA) with the long-term goal of increasing the number of master's-level students and master's trained health professionals entering - and completing - doctoral programs and focusing their careers on cancer control research among Latinos. For the proposed second funding cycle, the Éxito! program will continue to recruit an annual cohort of participants from across the U.S. and provide them with support along the pipeline from master's to doctoral level training. The five aims to accomplish our overarching goal are to: 1) conduct an annual five-day summer institute for 25 participants; 2) award up to 10 annual paid summer internships in Latino cancer control research; 3) promote retention throughout the graduate pipeline with web-based academic support and career-building opportunities that include peer-to-peer professional support, interactive online communication forums, and facilitated connections to pre-and post-doctoral programs; 4) achieve doctoral enrollment rate of 30% or more, at most 15% doctoral-student attrition, and at least 50% of doctoral students conducting cancer control research; and 5) develop and implement active and passive dissemination plans by sharing the program with at least two Hispanic Serving Institutions and presenting project findings at professional meetings and in peer- reviewed literature. Program evaluation will include process, impact, and outcome measurements to monitor participant's academic progress as well as the influence of the Éxito! program on intention and efficacy regarding pursuit of the doctorate and career in cancer research. The Éxito! program continues to align well with the mission of the IHPR, which is ""to research the causes and solutions to the unequal impact of cancer and chronic disease affecting residents of South Texas and the nation to improve the health of all people while serving as a national model for health promotion research and education."" Further, the Éxito! program complements other UTHSCSA-wide federally-funded training programs as the only Latino training program focused on doctoral-level preparation in the social, behavioral and public health sciences.

"Tailoring of Childhood Obesity Screening and Counseling for Latino Families with Preschool-Aged Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application for a K23 award for a fellowship trained pediatrician specializing in Pediatric Nutrition and childhood obesity. The candidate is committed to an academic career as a physician scientist conducting patient-oriented research in childhood obesity. This award will support the candidate's training and attainment of expertise in three areas: qualitative research methods, cultural tailoring of technology-based interventions, and implementation science. This training will support his overall goals of designing and rigorously testing childhood obesity interventions that can be readily translated and disseminated and that will provide critical insight for care in diverse settings and patient groups. To achieve these goals, Dr. Haemer has assembled a cross-disciplinary mentoring team, each with outstanding experience in research methods and strong records of successful mentoring: Dr. Glasgow, a behavioral scientist who is renown within the field of implementation science; Dr. Bull, an expert researcher in technology-based health promotion; and Dr. Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition specialist with extensive research and clinical experience in childhood obesity and with a long history of mentoring young investigators. The proposed research addresses the huge knowledge gap in cost-effective ways for the healthcare system to influence both patient-level and population-level outcomes for childhood obesity. Evidence-based approaches of surveillance, screening, prevention and treatment largely remain uncertain or untested, especially for the youngest children from groups at highest risk of obesity-related health disparity. This K23 award will study methods for prevention and treatment applied to Latino preschool-aged children from low- income families. The research will test the central hypothesis that culturally tailored screening and counseling will be more effective at decreasing BMI trajectory than usual care. Specific aims include: 1. To characterize components of primary care interactions that should be culturally tailored to enhance motivation for healthy lifestyle change among Latino parents with preschoolers 2. To design a technology-user interface that maximizes acceptance by Latino parents of young children. 3. To pilot test a technology-supported screening and counseling protocol tailored to Latino parents using findings of Aims 1 and 2. Using an implementation science perspective, we will assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation fidelity, and sustainable maintenance of the intervention in clinical practice during the pilot RCT. This research and training will form the basis for an RO1 proposal to test technology-supported childhood obesity prevention and treatment interventions targeting young children from low-income Latino families.

"Participatory Trial of a Health Promoting School Approach to Positive Youth Development and Wellness Promotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The overarching goal of this study is to address key adolescent health issues (substance use, emotional well-being, developmental assets) and critical social determinants of health (academic engagement and achievement) for all students, but 9th grade youth of Latino, Hmong, Somali and other African heritage in particular, through a focus on student-school connectedness and the school environment. The school environment, including student-teacher relationships and opportunities for meaningful student participation, establishes student connectedness, leading to multiple health-protective outcomes. However youth of color often express less connection to school. Health Promoting Schools' interventions may improve connectedness by addressing 3 components: 1) classroom wellbeing topics/approaches, 2) school environment or ethos, 3) links with families and/or communities. We will build on a NIMHD (R24MD00766-01)-funded pilot that developed and evaluated Project TRUST (Training for Resiliency in Urban Students and Teachers), an intervention to support teachers in improving relationships with, and promoting PYD for Somali, Latino, and Hmong 9th grade youth. Core partners Somali, Latino and Hmong Partnership for Health and Wellness (SoLaHmo), University of Minnesota Program in Health Disparities Research and College of Education and Human Development along with teachers, parents, and youth co-developed and piloted the intervention. Findings suggest that Project TRUST is feasible and acceptable to educators and may improve youth educational engagement, emotional well-being, and developmental assets across race/ethnic groups. Findings identified the need for broader improvements in the school environment and involvement with parents to substantively improve connectedness. In the current proposal we will expand our CBPR Coalition to co-direct refinement and implementation of a multi- component Health Promoting Schools intervention including: 1) pilot-tested teacher professional development, 2) student- defined enhanced environment, and 3) parent-defined enhanced community/family connection. The Coalition will finalize the intervention using a phased intervention map that integrates community perspectives with theoretical approaches to PYD and evidence based practices. The study aims will be accomplished through a group randomized trial in 10 urban schools with diverse populations representing approximately 1,900 students. Study aims are: Aim 1: Assess the effects of a school-based multi-component intervention on improved school connectedness, school engagement, and developmental assets through a group randomized, participatory trial. Aim 2: Assess the effects of a health promoting schools multi-component intervention on emotional well-being, tobacco and other substance use, and academic outcomes through a group randomized, participatory trial. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationships between participatory factors (CBPR collaborative processes, capacities, and contextual factors), school intervention implementation, and study outcomes. The focus on school connectedness and environment as key proximal social determinants of health and promising intervention targets is innovative while the CBPR approach assures project success and sustainability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of our study is to use a community based participatory research approach to implement and evaluate a multi-component school-based intervention to enhance emotional well-being and academic achievement, and prevent tobacco and other substance use through the promotion of student-school connectedness for all students, but Latino, Hmong, Somali and other African heritage 9th grade youth in particular. We will build on a NIMHD -funded pilot that developed and evaluated Project TRUST (Training for Resiliency in Urban Students and Teachers), an intervention to support teachers in improving relationships with, and promoting positive youth development for Somali, Latino, and Hmong 9th grade youth.

"Online course to prepare promotores to support low-income Latino parents of children with special healthcare needs KDH Research & Communication (KDHRC) submits this Fast Track SBIR proposal to develop, implement, and rigorously evaluate a culturally competent, online professional development course to prepare promotores to support low-income Latino parents of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) as they navigate the education and health care systems. CSHCN experience poorer health, psychosocial, and academic outcomes than the general child population exhibited by frequent school absences, behavioral problems, grade repetition, and lack of school engagement. Compared to other CSHCN, Latino CSHCN are more likely to experience health and educational disparities including a lack of adequate health care insurance, specialist referrals, and consistent, affordable health care. Latino parents of CSHCN frequently experience difficulties while navigating the education and health care systems. Low-income Latino parents, especially first-generation immigrants, face linguistic and cultural barriers when seeking necessary medical services and educational accommodations for their CSHCN. Promotores, recognized as key health care workers in underserved communities, are ideally positioned to support Latino parents of CSHCN. Puentes will have a broad reach, be cost-effective, appropriate for promotores and their community-based organization (CBO) employers, as well as meet experts’ calls for programs addressing the need for culturally appropriate interventions to support this vulnerable population.  Puentes-trained promotores will empower Latino parents with health care and school system navigation skills to benefit their CSHCN. Puentes will contain a six-module online course, which will use text, video clips, and virtual client interactive training. Puentes-trained promotores will build parents’ knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and skills to request educational accommodations, interface with the child’s medical team, meaningfully participate in their child’s educational and medical care teams, coordinate health care and school services, and work with the school to resolve any challenges related to their child’s accommodations. The content and evaluation of Puentes will be driven by the theory of planned behavior, which has extensive empirical support and widespread applicability in health promotion interventions. In Phase I, we will create a program architecture plan comprised of a course outline, video storyboards, and virtual client details as well as a prototype of two full course modules. We will evaluate the modules in a two- stage feasibility evaluation study. In Phase II, we will use the architecture plan and feasibility study findings to finalize program videos, courses, resources, and dissemination website. A group-randomized controlled trial will explore the efficacy of Puentes when implemented in Latino-serving CBOs. Our market research suggests a significant need and eager market, and support from more than 39 organizations representing over 6,000 promotores substantiates Puentes’ programmatic importance and commercial potential. Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) encounter obstacles such as school absences, lack of school engagement, and grade repetition that can lead to poor lifelong academic, health, and social outcomes. Latino parents of CSHCN frequently experience linguistic and cultural barriers while navigating the education and health care systems, compounding the disparities their children experience. Puentes will be a culturally competent, online professional development course to prepare promotores to support Latino parents to navigate the health care and educational systems. Puentes-trained promotores will provide Latino parents of CSHCN with the knowledge and skills to overcome barriers and advocate for their children’s academic and social success.",Online course to prepare promotores to support low-income Latino parents of children with special healthcare needs,9463535,R44MD012412,"['Anxiety ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arthritis ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attitude ', ' Autistic Disorder ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' Infantile Autism ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Autism ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Client ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epilepsy ', ' epileptogenic ', ' epileptiform ', ' epilepsia ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' Epileptics ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Hearing ', ' sound perception ', ' hearing perception ', ' Insurance ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Market Research ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Review ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional society ', ' professional membership ', ' professional association ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Film ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Latino ', ' Specialist ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' brain-injured ', ' brain damage ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Immigrant ', ' Letters ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' Learning disability ', ' medically necessary care ', ' medically necessary ', ' Emotional ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Communication Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Navigation System ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' health training ', ' Secure ', ' certificate program ', ' community building ', ' course material development ', ' class development ', ' course development ', ' class module ', ' course module ', ' online curriculum ', ' E-course ', ' online course ', ' Workforce Development ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' ']",NIMHD,"KDH RESEARCH AND COMMUNICATION, INC.",R44,2018,210120,0.14850488294699415
"The Effect of Pesticide Exposure on Cognitive and Brain Development in Latino Children: PACE5 Concern is mounting that commonly used pesticides are detrimental to children. Children are rapidly undergoing cognitive, sensory, and motor development, and disruption of normal maturation can have life-long consequences. The extant literature strongly indicates that prenatal exposure to pesticides leads to abnormal neurobehavioral development. A recent brain imaging study further showed that prenatal pesticide exposure is associated with disrupted anatomical brain development. However, results concerning the consequences of postnatal pesticide exposure are much less conclusive. Some studies have reported neurobehavioral deficits following postnatal pesticide exposure, but just as many studies have reported no negative consequences. Currently there are no studies that assess the effects of postnatal pesticide exposure on brain development using anatomical or functional brain imaging. More conclusive research on the effects of postnatal exposure on neurodevelopment requires a highly exposed population, a longitudinal design, and careful quantification of exposure and outcomes. We propose a two-group, prospective, longitudinal study of Latino children 7 years of age with quarterly measurement of cumulative pesticide exposure using passive dosimetry wristbands as well as documentation of prenatal and early life exposure through life history techniques. Children from Latino seasonal farmworker families will be compared with children from Latino families not participating in farm work and not living in an agricultural environment. Children in Latino farmworker families are at particularly high risk of exposure. Not only are pesticides frequently used in their low quality housing, but they are also exposed to agricultural pesticides used in nearby fields brought home by parental/sibling farmworkers on clothing. Children will be followed for 2 years with measurement of neurobehavioral function at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. Neuroimaging will be performed in a subset of participants with structural and functional brain organization assessed at baseline and two years later. Specific aims for this project are: Aim 1: Compare 2-year longitudinal and prenatal/early life pesticide exposure between children of Latino seasonal farmworkers and children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Aim 2: Compare 2-year longitudinal neurobehavioral and emotional and behavioral functioning among children of Latino seasonal farmworkers relative to children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Aim 3: Compare 2-year longitudinal anatomical and functional brain development between children of Latino seasonal farmworkers and children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Our nearly two decades of environmental justice (EJ) and community-based participatory research (CBPR) on pesticide exposure with farmworkers and their families provides an auspicious context to engage this vulnerable population in a study of both scientific and environmental justice importance. Most research indicates that prenatal pesticide exposure is detrimental to the developing brain. However, results concerning the effects of postnatal pesticide exposure on brain development are conflicting. The current project will evaluate the effects of pesticide exposure on neurobehavioral and brain development children from Latino farmworker families.",The Effect of Pesticide Exposure on Cognitive and Brain Development in Latino Children: PACE5,9533544,R01ES008739,"['Affect ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomy Qualifier ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomic Structures and Systems ', ' Anatomic Structure, System, or Substance ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Cholinesterases ', ' choline esterase II ', ' Acylcholineacylhydrolase ', ' Acylcholine acylhydrolase ', ' Clothing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Housing ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Parents ', ' Pest Control ', ' Pesticides ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Exposure to ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' postnatal ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Farming environment ', ' Farm ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' life history ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' dosimetry ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' fetal exposure ', ' exposed in utero ', ' Documentation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' developmental disease ', ' developmental disorder ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Organophosphates ', ' Motor ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Calendar ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' pesticide exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' seven years of age ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 7 years of age ', ' 7 year old ', ' neurotoxic ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' environmental justice ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' imaging study ', ' agricultural pesticide ', ' ']",NIEHS,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2018,607111,0.11835069153271467
"Enhanced Primary Care Nutrition and Screen time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Primary Care Based Feeding and Screen Time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants Latino children experience higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic white children, a disparity that emerges in infancy. Among Latino children, those with Spanish-speaking parents are at highest risk for obesity. Research has shown that optimal feeding strategies in early life and avoidance of screen time may lower the risk of childhood obesity, which in turn, reduces the risk of obesity and its comorbidities through    adulthood. However, few interventions have sought to promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino parents. In addition, most interventions in the literature that address infant obesity prevention have been conducted through home visits or special trips to the intervention site by parents, approaches that may not be sustainable in low-resource settings due to cost and the burden on participants. Given that infants are expected to have 7 well-child visits in the first year of life, primary care is an ideal setting in which to ofer parental education on infant feeding and screen time recommendations. The overall objective of this proposal is to design, pilot test, and refine a Spanish-language, culturally appropriate, primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in Latino infants born to Spanish-speaking    mothers. Our overarching hypothesis is that focused education on infant feeding and screen time avoidance will lead to use of optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers and result in less weight gain in the first year of life. In preparation for submitting an R01 application to test this hypothesis, we propose research with the following specific aims to be conducted at the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) outpatient pediatric clinic: Aim 1: Use the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to design 5 group educational modules that promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers; Aim 2: Use a pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to test a yearlong intervention in which the 5 modules (Aim 1) are provided to Spanish-speaking Latino mothers just after well-child visits at ages 2 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, and 12 months (primary outcomes will include use of responsive feeding practices, infant dietary intake, and infant active and passive television viewing time; secondary outcomes will be infant anthropometrics); Aim 3: Use qualitative methods to assess how individual components of the intervention from Aim 2 affected feeding and screen time practices. By the conclusion of    this award, we will have a scalable and potentially reproducible intervention for infant feeding and screen time practices, one that is linguistically and culturally appropriate for Spanish-speaking Latino parents and aims to reduce weight gain in the first year of life while promoting habits that protect against obesity across the lifespan. Dr. Amy Beck, PI for this mentored career development award, is a bilingual pediatrician with considerable clinical experience caring for low-income Latino children and a deep commitment to improving health outcomes    in this population. Dr. Beck is a pediatric attending at SFGH (a public hospital affiliated with UCSF that serves a majority Latino population) where she provides both general pediatric care and also is the co-director of the pediatric obesity clinic. With respect to her research background, Dr. Beck holds a MPH and completed a General Pediatrics research fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). During her fellowship, Dr. Beck used both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate risk factors for obesity among Latino children. She has 5 first-author publications, of which 4 directly inform this proposal. She is currently conducting two pilot intervention studies in obesity prevention and treatment for Latino children. Her long-term career goal is to be an independent investigator in the field of obesity prevention with a focus on improving preventive services for low-income Latino children. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Beck must strengthen her skills in biostatistics and qualitative methods and acquire new skills in dietary analysis and RCTs of behavioral interventions. Dr. Beck has formed an    interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors and consultants with expertise in general pediatrics, nutrition, psychology, anthropology, Latino health, pediatric obesity, and health policy. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Cabana, is an internationally respected health services researcher and the Division Chief of General Pediatrics at UCSF. Dr. Cabana has extensive expertise in the design and conduct of RCTs in the ambulatory setting and a strong track record of mentorship. In addition to her mentored research plan and ongoing tutorials with her    diverse mentorship team, Dr. Beck will take advantage of UCSF's numerous opportunities for research training. She will enroll in additional courses offered through the Training in Clinical Research Program that cover specific areas of her career development plan. She will also take a course at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health on dietary assessment. Finally, she will attend seminars offered by the Division of General Pediatrics and participate in the K scholars program offered by the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at UCSF. Dr. Beck has the full support of the UCSF Department of Pediatrics and the Division of General Pediatrics for this proposed award. By the conclusion of this award, Dr. Beck will be well positioned as an    independent investigator in the field of childhood obesity prevention research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the proposed research are to design and evaluate a low-cost, primary care-based intervention to prevent the onset of obesity in Latino infants. This proposal is relevant to public health because obesity often begins early in life and is associated with diabetes, heart disease, and numerous other comorbidities, and because Latino children in the United States experience disproportionately high rates of obesity. The goal of the proposed intervention is to promote infant feeding, nutrition and screen time practices that will be protective against obesity across the lifespan.",Enhanced Primary Care Nutrition

"3/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center Overall- Project Summary The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically, the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican- Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics, Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos. Project Narrative The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at an ISUPS (FAMU), and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The proposed two full projects and pilot project include investigators from the three institutions and will leverage on specimens collected across the partnership from Blacks and Latinos, representing a wide range of subpopulations within these minority groups. Thus, our studies will reveal unprecedented findings about these two understudied minority populations. Importantly, these projects will be instrumental in transferring cutting edge and innovative technologies to FAMU, will provide research training opportunities across the partnership to 100 students, post-doctoral fellows, and early stage investigators, and will expand in a significant way the research focus at UF and USC-NCCC to address cancer health disparities in prostate and pancreas cancer.","3/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center",9635128,U54CA233465,"['Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Central American ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Scientist ', ' South American ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' success ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Tissue Model ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' minority trainee ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' demographics ', ' health equity ', ' screening ', ' genetic make-up ', ' genetic makeup ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Student recruitment ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' minority scientist ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' translational cancer research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U54,2018,1141251,0.10242261202746027
"Linking state policies to Latino and Asian American immigrant health care access Project Summary/Abstract While many immigrants arrive in the US with good health status, there are persistent disparities in access to health care for immigrant groups that may contribute to their more than expected health declines over time, particularly among the nation's two largest immigrant populations, Latinos and Asians. Since the late 1990s there has also been a proliferation of public policies at the state level that have an impact on immigrant populations. There is growing evidence that immigrant policies are a structural factor associated with disparities in Latino and Asian immigrant health care access. Yet, there is limited understanding of the processes by which policy, a contextual factor, has an impact on individual-level health care access outcomes. This study aims to examine the pathways between state policy and access to care by (1) identifying and assessing the variation among Latino and Asian immigrants' experiences of exclusion related to immigrant policies, (2) understanding the extent to which experiences of policy-related exclusion are associated with barriers to health care, and (3) assessing the extent to which those associations are modified by citizenship status, race/ethnicity, and knowledge of policies. We will conduct a mixed-methods study of the experiences of exclusion among Latino and Asian immigrants in California, a demographically diverse state with a range of state-level immigrant policies. We will assess the association between access to health care and experiences of exclusion across five sectors: health care, social services, education, employment, and law enforcement. We will analyze data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a representative population survey of state residents, combined with a follow-up survey of 2,000 CHIS immigrant respondents that collects additional information on experiences related to immigrant policies. We will also conduct semi-structured interviews of immigrants in two regions to identify the nuances of their experiences of and responses to those policies. The findings from this research can both identify policies outside the health sector that have impacts on immigrant access to health care, and suggest educational interventions which could improve immigrant knowledge in ways that improves their access to needed health care. Project narrative This study will contribute to knowledge regarding the impact of public policies on access to health care by examining the experiences of Latino and Asian immigrants. It will build from research on the social determinants of health to understand the pathways between contextual social factors and individual-level health access outcomes.",Linking state policies to Latino and Asian American immigrant health care access,9568400,R01MD012292,"['Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Employment ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Exclusion ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' Latin American ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2018,620414,0.06449381085326938
"Mentoring in the Context of Improving Care for Latinos with Diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The exponential growth of the US born and immigrant Latino population over the last two decades in the United States, coupled with the national increase in obesity, has led to an enormous increase in the number of Latino patients with diabetes. Effective care of these patients is often complicated by language barriers, low health literacy, and low patient engagement which all contribute to well-documented disparities in diabetes outcomes. This proposal outlines a 5 year career development plan for the candidate to expand her mentoring work with early career researchers focused on clinical and health services research dedicated to improving diabetes outcomes among low-income Latino patients. In addition to mentoring plans, the proposal outlines three specific aims to a) Identify patient perceptions of barriers and facilitators to accessing language assistance services in diabetes care; b) Explore barriers and facilitators to the establishment of healthy infant feeding habits among low income Latina women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in the context of an automated telephone self-management intervention; and c) Develop and formatively evaluate a social marketing campaign aimed at encouraging Latino parents with diabetes to decrease sugar sweetened beverage consumption in their children aged 3-11. Through the efficient leveraging of existing resources, collaborations, data, and affiliations with NIH-funded networks, the overarching goal of this application is to promote the effective mentorship of early career investigators at all levels of the research training pipeline in Latino diabetes clinical an translational research. The enormous growth of the Latino population with diabetes poses challenges for patients, physicians, and health care systems, particularly when language barriers exist. The proposed funding will support the expanded mentoring of early career investigators--from every level of the training pipeline--in clinical and health services research dedicated to improving outcomes for low-income Latinos with diabetes. It will also support a research project on determining Latino diabetes patients’ role in overcoming language barriers in health care, and two innovative projects aimed at empowering Latino parents with diabetes to decrease diabetes risk in their children.",Mentoring in the Context of Improving Care for Latinos with Diabetes,9461528,K24DK102057,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' outpatient treatment ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Educational Status ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Infant ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Marketing ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' ranpirnase ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' sugar ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' empowered ', ' cohort ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' TIM1 ', ' P60 ', ' GEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' NIDDK ', ' Research Training ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Clinical Services ', ' health literacy ', ' sweetened beverage ', ' feeding ', ' Minority ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Consumption ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' improved outcome ', ' minority investigator ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K24,2018,183864,0.17852528386542948
"Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Diabetes incurs the most expensive annual chronic disease-related health care costs and certain ethnic groups, such as Latinos, are disproportionately affected by the burden of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). Patients with T2DM also have comorbid chronic conditions that create complexities for proper management, and have implications for future research on integrating primary and behavioral care, particularly in dis- advantaged groups. Cost-effective, sustainable, and patient-centered adaptations of evidence-based approaches to chronic disease management are needed to meet the needs of the most vulnerable, low- resource communities. Integrated Health Care is the care that results from a practice team of primary care and behavioral health clinicians working together with patients and using a systematic and cost-effective approach to provide patient-centered care for a defined population. This care may address mental health conditions, health behaviors, life stressors and crises, and clinical outcomes. Care integration is a cornerstone of effective integrated health care that leads to improved clinical and quality of life outcomes and reduces health-care costs and hospitalizations, especially in vulnerable populations. The goal of this project is to improve integrated care services at a federally-qualified Community Health Center (CHC). Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D), is a randomized controlled trial that will test the effectiveness of an integrated behavioral health and primary cae chronic care disease management intervention for low income T2DM Latino patients with 2 or more chronic conditions accessing care within San Ysidro Health Center (SYHC). The study aims are to: 1) improve glycemic control, 2) improve cardiovascular risk profiles, 3) decrease psychological distress, and 4) evaluate the patient and provider acceptability and sustainability of the program. LUNA-D will recruit 414 non-insulin using adult T2DM patients with 2 or more chronic diseases. Half will be randomized to the Special Intervention (SI) and half to Usual Care (UC). The SI is a 3-month intensive intervention including fully integrated clinical visits with a mid-level provider (MLP) co-located with a behavioral health counselor (BHC) and peer-led evidence-based group health education sessions and proactive care coordination. Following the intense intervention period, the SI will receive booster sessions and fully integrated MLP/BHC clinical visits across 9 additional months. Usual Care is represented by passive appointments with the primary care physician and passive referrals to behavioral health and traditional health education. HbA1C measurements will be taken at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-months to detect changes in glycemic control. Clinical lab measures, medication adherence, weight, health behaviors and psychosocial measures will also be obtained across the study. Demonstration of clinical improvement will support adoption by the SYHC. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed Latinos Understanding the Need for Adherence in Diabetes (LUNA-D) study, will conduct research that aims to reduce chronic disease disparities for disadvantaged Latino populations along the California-Mexico border region of the United States. LUNA-D proposes to test the ability of a fully integrated behavioral health and primary care multiple chronic disease management intervention in a federally-qualified community health care setting to

"Cultural Neuroscience of Latino Mental Health: Collectivism and the Psychophysiology of Self-Regulation in Adolescents Project Summary/Abstract  Latino adolescents in the United States face a number of mental health disparities. In particular, this group appears to experience an excessive disease burden due to social anxiety. In line with National Institute of Mental Health research initiatives, the present study seeks to examine how cultural factors relevant to Latinos are related to neural correlates thought to be associated with clinical dimensions of social anxiety, in an effort to inform the design of tailored prevention and intervention efforts aimed at mitigating mental health inequalities. Specifically, the present study plans to investigate the association of collectivism (an attitudinal cultural value in which group cohesion and interpersonal relationships are given great value and priority) and two event-related brain potential (ERP) components, the error-related negativity (ERN) and the feedback negativity (FN). The ERN and FN are negative deflections in the ERP that occur following error detection and receipt of feedback. Extensive literature links them to cognitive processes (exaggerated error-monitoring and feedback response) that contribute to social anxiety symptomatology. These electrophysiological measures have also been conceptualized as reflections of individual variance in threat sensitivity. Specifically, the meaning of a certain context to an individual can enhance the neural response to errors or feedback. In line with this understanding, for individuals who endorse adherence to collectivism, the social context is thought to have especially high importance. Thus, errors and negative feedback that take place in a social context are more salient, which is manifested in enhanced ERN and FN. We aim to test three manipulations of social context in samples of Latino (n = 37) and non-Latino Caucasian (n = 37) adolescents using electrophysiological research methods (ERPs). Each task will include an ecologically valid manipulation of social environment that reflects facets of the cultural and developmental group under study. The three experimental tasks are complementary in their ability to address the notion that culture interacts with neural mechanisms associated with cognitive processes that contribute to social anxiety symptoms. Consistent with a cultural neuroscience perspective, this research intends to explore how an individual’s view of themselves and their connections to others play a critical role in determining the implicit meaning and value of the social context and of one’s neural response to social stimuli. Findings may have translational implications and inform the science that guides the development of culturally appropriate anxiety treatment for underserved youth. The long-term goal of this project is to provide the applicant with training that will set the stage for a career in the field of pediatric cultural clinical neuroscience. Thus, the proposed fellowship is designed to promote acquisition of new knowledge and skills related to psychophysiological research methods, as well as to integrate training in cultural and developmental frameworks. Project Narrative The present study aims to examine the interaction of culture and brain-behavior associations that contribute to anxiety-related disparities in Latino adolescents, an underserved group. Findings will expand the empirical evidence available to advance cultural neuroscience and guide the development of culturally-appropriate prevention and treatment innovations.",Cultural Neuroscience of Latino Mental Health: Collectivism and the Psychophysiology of Self-Regulation in Adolescents,9458587,F31MH111187,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Anxiety ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cues ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Elements ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Feedback ', ' Fellowship ', ' Goals ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Play ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Values ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' career ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' neural network ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Detection ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' brain behavior ', ' high risk ', ' health inequalities ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Same-sex ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' severe anxiety ', ' Pathological anxiety ', ' social anxiety ', ' anxiety treatment ', ' cognitive process ', ' neural correlate ', ' symptomatology ', ' social participation ', ' social involvement ', ' social engagement ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,F31,2018,10541,0.016074134007181575
"A Longitudinal Analysis of Acculturation Differences between Immigrant Latino Parents and Youth: Implications on Family Functioning and Youth Development ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Children of Latino-origin immigrants are the fastest growing sector of the US child population (Passel, 2011). Thus, it is important to examine how experiences in a country that is not the family's country of origin impinges on youth development. The proposed study seeks to examine how parent-youth acculturation differences (AD) among Latino immigrant families are directly and indirectly linked to youth emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning. Research examining the AD-youth outcomes relationship has rendered mixed findings (Telzer, 2010). Some work indicates a problematic association between AD on youth socio-emotional (Schofield, Parke, Kim, Coltrane, 2008), substance use (Marsiglia, Nagoshi, Parsai, Booth, & Castro, 2014), and behavioral (Szapocznik, Santisteban, Kurtines, Ferez-Vidal & Hervis, 1984) outcomes, while other work does not. Several methodological, conceptual, and measurement limitations have been noted in the current body of work. To reconcile these inconsistencies this study seeks to examine longitudinally: (1) how AD affects family processes that are central to youth development and are salient for immigrant families; (2) how AD affects youth emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning; and (3) how AD indirectly affects youth development through its effects on family processes. A sample of 450 Latino immigrant families will be recruited from high schools in the Central California area. Data will be collected every year for three years from these families on: parent and youth dimensions of acculturation (i.e., cultural values, identity, and language use); family processes that are important for youth development in general (i.e., parental monitoring, communication, and cohesion) and those that are salient among immigrant families (i.e., language brokering and parentification); and youth socio-emotional well-being, risk behaviors, academic achievement, and self-regulation. This study is positioned to make several important contributions to this area of research by: using a multidimensional approach in the measurement of acculturation; examining the longitudinal ramifications of AD on youth development; utilizing a statistically novel approach (latent- difference score analyses) to calculate the AD; identifying specific family processes that serve as mechanisms of influence in the AD-youth outcomes relationship; and informing future prevention efforts geared towards improving the well-being and reducing health disparities among Latino immigrant youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Parent-youth acculturation differences (AD) have been linked, albeit inconsistently, to problematic youth health behaviors such as: tobacco use (Elder et al., 2005), risky sexual practices (Schwartz, 2012), and substance use (Martinez, 2006). What remains unclear and necessitates further examination is the role family processes play in AD-youth outcomes relationship. The proposed study is poised to contribute greatly in the understanding of how the family unit can be used as a mechanism of influence in the AD-youth outcomes relationship to promote positive health and development among 2nd generation immigrant Latino youth.",A Longitudinal Analysis of Acculturation Differences between Immigrant Latino Parents and Youth: Implications on Family Functioning and Youth Development,9527179,SC2HD090724,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Behavior ', ' Berry ', ' California ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communication ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' indexing ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk-Taking ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Benign ', ' Link ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Immigrant ', ' Nature ', ' cognitive function ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Dimensions ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' cohesion ', ' high school ', ' peer ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' parental monitoring ', ' parent monitoring ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NICHD,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FRESNO,SC2,2018,140000,0.015986104967029385

Consistent with this disparity in ACP, Latino advanced cancer patients receive aggressive, burdensome EOL care more often than do their non-Latino counterparts. They are also less likely than others to use hospice services and to receive EOL care in line with their preferences. Consequently, the EOL care that Latino advanced cancer patients receive appears to be suboptimal, inferior to the care that non-Latino patients receive, infrequently guided by ACP, and often counter to their values. In this project, we will address these disparities in ACP & EOL care through two closely related sub-projects. In the first of these sub-projects, we aim to identify beliefs that contribute to Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care (Specific Aim 1). We will conduct an observational study of beliefs, ACP and EOL outcomes in 400 advanced cancer patients (N=200 Latino; N=200 non-Latino) and their informal caregivers (e.g., spouses; N=400) whom we will recruit from clinics in New York City, Dallas, and Chicago. In this observational study, we will examine the extent to which religious, familial and cultural medical beliefs mediate or moderate Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care, and identify significantly influential beliefs as potential targets of an intervention to reduce those disparitis. In the second sub-project, using results from this observational study as a guide, we aim to develop and pilot a belief-contextualization intervention to reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care (Specific Aim 2). Specific Aim 2 will proceed in three phases. In Phase I, we will briefly review results of Specific Aim 1 and ask Latino stakeholders to provide input on possible belief-contextualization interventions to determine those likely to be most effective in, and acceptable to, Latino communities. In Phase II, we will design a belief-contextualization intervention to reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care that incorporates elements identified in Phase I and then vet that intervention with a separate group of Latino stakeholders. In Phase III, we will evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of the belief-contextualization intervention developed in Phase II. Overall, results of this study will identify influential beliefs that explain Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP & EOL care, and offer the promise of an effective approach to the reduction of Latino/non-Latino disparities in ACP, and, ultimately, EOL care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer is the second leading cause of death among Latino and non-Latino (White and Black) Americans. Latinos are the fastest growing ethnic group in the United States, and are less likely than their non-Latino counterparts to engage in advance care planning (ACP). They are also more likely to receive aggressive, burdensome end-of-life (EOL) care at odds with their cultural beliefs. Consequently, there is a pressing need to address Latino/non-Latino disparities in cancer ACP and EOL care. Identification and targeting of influential beliefs about medical care is expected to reduce disparities in ACP and EOL care. It will, thus, reduce disparities in the quality of the medical decision-making and care Latino cancer patients receive near death.",Latino vs. Non-Latino Disparities in Advance Care Planning & End-of-Life Care,9480605,R01MD007652,"['Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Belief ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Influentials ', ' Living Wills ', ' living will ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Resuscitation ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Terminally Ill ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Do-Not-Resuscitate Orders ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Hospice Care ', ' Intensive Care ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Caring ', ' Married Persons ', ' Spouses ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Trust ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' Healthcare Power of Attorney ', ' Health Care Power of Attorney ', ' Inferior ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' cancer pain ', ' authority ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' end of life care ', ' Secrecy ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' palliative ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' Informal care giver ', ' informal caregiver ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' phase II designs ', ' phase 2 designs ', ' ']",NIMHD,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,R01,2018,318800,0.13972987082743124
"SALUD: Syndemic Alcohol Use Disorders, Violence, and HIV/STI in Young Latino Men Project Summary: Given the pervasive disparities in alcohol use disorders (AUD) and HIV among young Latino men, the proposed training plan will build upon my work on HIV transmission risk and co-morbidities by training me in: 1) alcohol and HIV epidemiology, 2) the integration of biological measures with behavioral science, and 3) longitudinal data analysis, while expanding the scope of my health disparities research to include Latino men. With the guidance of my exceptional Mentor Team, the proposed training aims will be achieved with a combination of in-/formal coursework and workshops in alcohol epidemiology, stress response biomarkers, and longitudinal statistical methods as well as practical experience in primary data collection, assay, and analysis, of salivary, urinary, and blood stress biomarkers with behavioral data in ethnic minority populations. In addition, this K01 will provide me with guidance to develop skills for a successful academic career and support for my transition into an independent investigator. Men make up 87% of new HIV infections among Latinos. Latino men play a central role in bridging HIV/STI across sexual networks due to their sexual risk behaviors (e.g., concurrent sex partners, unprotected anal sex, same-sex [MSM] activity). Furthermore, harmful alcohol use increases risk behavior and IPV perpetration, all factors associated with a substantially increased risk for HIV/STI. The syndemic co-occurrence of AUD, intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV/STI is theorized to take root in systemic socio-structural disadvantage, but the mechanisms causing this syndemic are not well understood, especially in Latino men. The Social Stress Theory suggests that social inequity elevates exposure and vulnerability to stress, limits access to coping resources, and increases AUD and HIV disparities. The proposed longitudinal, epidemiological study aims to elucidate the temporal sequence of AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI, as well as identify risk/protective social stress factors in Latino men (versus white men) during their critical transition from adolescence (12-18 years) to mid-adulthood (32-42 years). To achieve this, we propose secondary analysis of four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n=5,140), which contains rich social, behavioral, and biological data (e.g., stress response, HIV/STI biomarkers). Findings from this research will inform the development of more effective AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI prevention and treatment interventions for Latino men, and will highlight sub-group nuances among Latino men (e.g., by non-/white race, national sub-group, and sexual orientation). Classified as High Priority by the NIH Office of AIDS Research, this K01 will provide cross- cutting research training for a highly productive ethnic minority junior investigator to conduct HIV/AIDS Research to Reduce Latino Health Disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections and to understand the role of chronic inflammation and AUD in exacerbating these disparities. Project narrative: SALUD (Cheers/Health) aims to elucidate the temporal sequence of alcohol use disorders (AUD), intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV/STI, and to identify risk/protective socio- structural factors, and stress and coping factors among Latino men (versus white men; n=5,140) in their critical transition from adolescence (12-18 years) to mid-adulthood (32-42 years). Identifying socio-structural and stress and coping targets for intervention will inform the development of more effective AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI prevention and treatment interventions for Latino men. Furthermore, the proposed training in alcohol and HIV epidemiology, integration of biological measures with behavioral science, and longitudinal data analysis will provide cross- cutting research training for a productive ethnic minority junior investigator in areas classified as High Priority (by the NIH Office of AIDS Research), and position her as an independent investigator and leader in Latino disparities in alcohol and HIV.","SALUD: Syndemic Alcohol Use Disorders, Violence, and HIV/STI in Young Latino Men",9465416,K01AA025009,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EBV ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Fit 5 Kids Screen Time Reduction Curriculum for Latino Preschoolers: A RCT ABSTRACT  Screen time is a major risk factor for childhood obesity and inadequate physical activity, both of which are determinants of type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, and multiple cancers. Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority in the US. Because US Latino children have more screen time and higher rates of obesity than their non-Latino White peers, interventions to reduce screen time adapted for Latino preschoolers are necessary to reduce health inequities related to obesity and T2D in the US. However, a systematic review reported no successful screen time reduction interventions among Latino preschoolers.  Our team's pilot study tested the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids screen time reduction curriculum among Latino preschoolers in Head Start. This short term cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the only successful screen time reduction program for Latino preschoolers, having significantly reduced screen time by over 25 minutes/day. Our culturally adapted, multi-level intervention consists of lessons taught by study staff directly to preschoolers during Head Start, a weekly parent newsletter, child-tailored goal setting with parents, a lending library (books, games, arts/crafts, etc.) and parenting tips via text messages several times/week. We will use a social ecological model and consider multiple levels of influences for analyses: (1) individual-level influences, e.g., acculturation and social cognitive theory, (2) families, e.g., screen time parenting practices, (3) schools, and (4) macro-environmental influences, e.g., neighborhood disorder. Building on this pilot work, we propose a long term, efficacy, cluster RCT of the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids among Latino preschoolers in Head Start from three US settings: Seattle, Houston, and the rural Central Valley of Washington State. Among 280 Latino 3-5 year olds at 20 Head Start centers, our Specific Aims (SA) and Hypotheses (H) include: SA1) To conduct a cluster RCT of the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids curriculum to evaluate its efficacy in reducing screen time and excessive weight gain over a school year (8-months)  H1) Fit 5 Kids will decrease children's screen time (primary outcome), BMI z-scores and dietary energy intake, and increase MVPA compared to controls SA2) To examine mediators and moderators associated with reducing Latino preschoolers' screen time  H2) Parents' outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and screen time parenting practices will mediate the relationship between Fit 5 Kids and changes to preschoolers' screen time  H3) Parents' depressive symptoms, stress, and social support will moderate changes to child screen time  The proposed Fit 5 Kids cluster RCT will confirm the pilot's promising results, and the larger sample will allow for mediation analyses to better understand mechanisms. This research will provide justification for a future community effectiveness trial with implementation by Head Start teachers, and the eventual widespread dissemination of Fit 5 Kids in Head Start centers nationally. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood obesity and metabolic risk are at record high levels in the US, and Latino children are at very high risk. This project will test an intervention called Fit 5 Kids, designed for Latino preschoolers to decrease their screen time in order to promote physical activity and healthy eating, and to prevent obesity. Ultimately, this line of research has the potential to provide an effective program to reduce risk of obesity for Latinos in the Head Start program and other preschool-based settings.",Fit 5 Kids Screen Time Reduction Curriculum for Latino Preschoolers: A RCT,9444166,R01DK113005,"['Academy ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Books ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Libraries ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Newsletter ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' teacher ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Sample Size ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Metabolic ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Lifetime Risk ', ' systematic review ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' obesity in children ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity prevention ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' tv watching ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' obesity risk ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' Text Messaging ', ' adults with obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adult obesity ', ' ']",NIDDK,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,696581,0.16754694788435862
"Mechanisms of Behavior Change in a Cultural Adaptation of Motivational Interviewing Proposal Summary/Abstract Project Title: Mechanisms of Behavior Change in Culturally Adapted Motivational Interviewing The NIAAA Five Year Strategic Plan prioritizes health disparities research for socially disadvantaged Latinos to reduce the disproportionate burden of negative consequences related to alcohol use compared to other racial/ethnic groups (NIAAA, 2013/2016). Cultural adaptation of evidence-based treatments, such as motivational interviewing (MI), can improve access and overall response to alcohol treatment. However, research progress has been hindered by the few theoretically-guided tests of adaptation and limited knowledge about the active ingredients and mechanisms of behavior change that might discriminate an adapted, compared to non-adapted, intervention. The proposed study will fill this important gap by testing a series of theory-driven hypotheses regarding the within-session predictors of MI outcome and a novel mechanism of culturally adapted MI (CAMI) (self-exploration → decreases in perceived acculturation stress, reduced depression and anxiety → reduced heavy drinking and consequences). The proposed study codes and examines within-session, process data from a parent RCT (AAR01021136, Lee: PI) guided by adaptation theory initially tested in a small RCT (AAK23021136, Lee: PI) that showed promising effects in favor of CAMI (Lee et al., 2013). The ongoing parent CAMI trial compared single session MI to single session CAMI delivered to Latino heavy drinkers (N=301, 18-65 yrs old). The parent study design (e.g., assessment of multiple self-report mediators) permits examination of a causal model, while attending to key recommendations on examining mechanisms of change (Kazdin & Nock, 2003). Up-to-date statistical approaches will be used to examine the MI causal hypothesis, such as investigating change and sustain talk together as a proportion estimate (Magill et al., 2014). The parent study design, which used an active comparator (MI), permits between-condition tests of within-session ingredients and mechanisms, which is a level of contrast rare in MI theory and one of the first a- priori investigations of processes of change in an adaptation study. The first task in adaptation is to confirm that key active treatment ingredients and mechanisms are preserved, so study aims are first, to assess MI ingredients and mechanisms among Latino adults, second, to examine novel MI ingredients and mechanisms potentially relevant to both conditions, and third, to test the theory, ingredients, and mechanisms specific to the adaptation. Long term objectives. Findings will improve dissemination of MI to Latinos by providing empirically-based guidelines on therapist training and on critical MI intervention ingredients. It will also improve understanding of the stress-health behavior link observed among health disparities populations and how MI can be used to disrupt this association. The proposed study will be one of the first to contribute to the emerging science on mechanisms of behavior change with health disparities populations and will yield important recommendations on the science of adaptation and ways to improve MI dissemination to community settings. Project Narrative Process research investigates how behavioral treatments work, thus findings can be used to optimize intervention efficacy and efficiency. In this process study we examine the within- session (motivational interviewing, MI) treatment predictors of behavior change in a health disparities population, socially-disadvantaged Latino heavy drinkers. The findings of this study, one of the first to examine mechanisms of MI cultural adaptation, will yield important recommendations on ways to improve MI dissemination to community settings serving Latino alcohol users as well as the science of adaptation more broadly.",Mechanisms of Behavior Change in a Cultural Adaptation of Motivational Interviewing,9445820,R01AA025485,"['social group process ', ' ethnicity group ', ' ethanol response ', ' response to alcohol ', ' response to ethanol ', ' behavior outcome ', ' causal diagram ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' motivational interview ', ' drink heavily ', ' excess alcohol consumption ', ' excess alcohol ingestion ', ' excess ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' extreme drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' active method ', ' depression ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' active comparator ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity in health ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' causal model ', ' Improve Access ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' pilot trial ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Coding System ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' skills ', ' Intervention ', ' novel ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' alcohol response ', ' Mediation ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' trial comparing ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' social ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' Guidelines ', ' behavior change ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' Series ', ' base ', ' 21+ years old ', ' improved ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' health disparity ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Knowledge ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Link ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Code ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' Outcome ', ' Training ', ' Investigation ', ' Modeling ', ' Complex ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Source ', ' Population ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' innovation ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' Methodology ', ' Acculturation ', ' Adult ', ' Empathy ', ' Science ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohols ', ' Client ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Work ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Awareness ', ' Anxiety ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Stress ', ' Literature ', ' Parents ', ' Recommendation ', ' Latino ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Group Processes ', ' Health behavior ', ' Research Design ', ' ']",NIAAA,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,488002,0.05715228624284024
"Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 proposal is to develop a culturally tailored nutrition communication intervention for primary prevention of breast cancer among bicultural Latinas. The overarching goal of the study is to advance understanding of how communication and acculturation processes influence cancer risk behaviors in order to design effective culturally tailored interventions to reduce cancer risk behaviors. This approach is particularly relevant when considering research on the health of the population of CA's San Joaquin Valley (SJV). A vast, largely rural region that produces over half of the nation's fruit, nuts, and vegetables, SJV is 50% Latino, mostly of Mexican origin6. The SJV has a very diverse Latino population: 25% are foreign-born, and their primary language may be an indigenous Mexican language rather than Spanish, while 75% are native-born U.S. citizens, who possess varied fluency in English abilities and whose families may include both legal and undocumented immigrants. The linguistic and acculturative diversity of this population poses new challenges for understanding how to design effective behavior change interventions. Most community-based interventions with Latinos have focused on those who speak Spanish exclusively, limiting our understanding of how acculturation and linguistic diversity impact communication intervention design and effectiveness. mHealth strategies offer a way of delivering interventions that are not only culturally appropriate for Latinos across the acculturation spectrum, but also appropriate for primary cancer prevention among young adults who are eager adopters of technology. This study aims to fill the knowledge gaps through a research plan designed around three sequential aims employing mixed methods for message testing and community intervention research. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with SJV Latinas (N=25) to explore factors that influence diet and food preparation behaviors as well as barriers and facilitators to the adoption of healthier diets. Results will inform the content categories for message tailoring, the structure of the messages, and the means of dissemination. In Aim 2, we will use the findings from Aim 1 to build and test a library of messages that are culturally appropriate for bicultural Latinas using focus groups and cognitive interviews. Aim 3 is the design, pilot test, and evaluation of an intervention to improve diet behaviors. The intervention consists of a series of culturally appropriate messages, developed in Aim 2, tailored to each participant's needs and preferences, to be disseminated via mobile phone over a 4-week period. We will evaluate preliminary outcomes (e.g., usage and feedback about the intervention and changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions) at four different times. We will determine preliminary estimates of effect size for behavioral outcomes (consumption of dietary fat, fruits and vegetables), based on two post-intervention data collections. We will additionally evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability in order to refine the intervention for a future larger randomized controlled trial, to be proposed in an R01 application before the end of this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The demographic and risk factor profiles for Latinos suggest a looming cancer epidemic: Latinos are younger, poorer, and less likely to have access to cancer screening than the general population.

"Preventing Diabetes in Latino Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and related health disparities represent some of the most significant public health challenges facing society. In particular, obese Latino adolescents are disproportionately impacted by insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is an intermediate stage in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and represents a critical opportunity for intervention. The Diabetes Prevention Program established that lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes. To date, no diabetes prevention studies have been conducted in obese Latino youth with prediabetes, a highly vulnerable and underserved group. Therefore, we propose a randomized-controlled trial to test the short-term (6-month) and long-term (12-month) efficacy of a culturally-grounded, lifestyle intervention, as compared to usual care, for improving glucose tolerance and reducing diabetes risk in 120 obese Latino adolescents with prediabetes. We will further test intervention effects on quality of life, explore the potential mediating effects of changes in total, regional, nd organ fat on improving glucose tolerance and increasing insulin sensitivity, and estimate the initial incremental cost- effectiveness of the intervention as compared with usual care for improving glucose tolerance. The overall approach is framed within a multilevel Ecodevelopmental model that leverages community, family, peer, and individual factors during the critical transition period of adolescence when changes in health behaviors and health outcomes are linked to future health trajectories. The intervention is guided by Social Cognitive Theory and employs key behavioral modification strategies to enhance self-efficacy and foster social support for making and sustaining healthy behavior changes. The application builds upon extant collaborations of a transdisciplinary team of investigators working in concert with local community agencies to address critical gaps in how diabetes prevention interventions for obese Latino youth are developed, implemented and evaluated. This innovative approach is an essential step in the development of scalable, cost-effective, solution- oriented programs to prevent type 2 diabetes in this and other populations of high-risk youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are critical public health issues in youth. This study will test the effects and estimate the cost-effectiveness of a culturally-grounded community-based lifestyle intervention on type 2 diabetes risk among obese Latino adolescents with prediabetes.",Preventing Diabetes in Latino Youth,9388342,R01DK107579,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', '

"ADAPTING AND ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF ‘HEALTHY DADS, HEALTHY KIDS’ FOR US LATINOS Project Summary Latinos in the United States face health disparities for obesity and related medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Targeting families to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors has been identified as an effective strategy to prevent obesity. With the importance of familism (family cohesion) among Latino population, a family based intervention is especially desirable as an engaging strategy to promote behaviors that support a healthy weight status and decrease obesity related health disparities for Latinos. Emerging evidence supports the need to include and target fathers in family based lifestyle behavior interventions. However, to date primarily mothers have been reached by such efforts in the US. Health Dads Healthy Kids (HDHK) is an evidence based program developed in Australia, shown to have significant weight and behavior treatment effects for fathers and their children, compared to controls. The HDHK program is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Family Systems Theory and aims to promote increased physical activity and improved dietary intake. An important innovation in the program is that fathers and children attend together and are both targeted as agents of behavior change for each other (reciprocal reinforcement) and to participate in fun, family activities together. HDHK has several features that may appeal to Latino families: it is delivered in group sessions by a trained facilitator from the community (collectivism), and it promotes paternal role- modeling (enforces respeto), family cohesion, and engagement together in lifestyle behaviors (familism). How- ever, HDHK should be systematically culturally adapted for Latino families to ensure appropriate enrollment, engagement and promotion of desired health outcomes for Latino families, prior to further evaluation. We propose to convene a panel of Latino fathers and mothers from the community to serve as key informants; and an expert panel of researchers with experience in culturally adapting parenting interventions for Latinos, Latino lifestyle behaviors, and the influence of Latino fathers. The two panels will work with the study team (including the developer of HDHK) to systematically modify the HDHK program to culturally adapt it for Latino families following the Ecological Validity Model. They will also inform the selection of items from established item banks of food and physical activity parenting. The resulting scales will be tested among a sample of Latino fathers to establish validated scales of parenting for Latino fathers, which is expected to be a mediator of children's behavior change in HDHK, and will be needed in the future trial. The resulting Latino-HDHK will be tested for feasibility (as measured by retention, engagement, and satisfaction), in a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=40). The pilot study will include a thorough process evaluation, including exit interviews with participating Latino fathers and their co-parent (typically mothers). Once completed, this developmental study will position us to apply for a future R01 to assess the Latino-HDHK in a fully powered randomized controlled trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latino adults and children experience health disparities for overweight and obesity-related medical conditions, and therefore family level obesity prevention programs for Latino populations are urgently needed. `Health Dads Healthy Kids' is the first program to primarily target fathers for obesity prevention for themselves and their children, with significant and clinically relevant treatment effects. We propose to systematically culturally adapt `Healthy Dads Healthy Kids' for Latino families and test the feasibility of the program among a community sample of Latino families.","ADAPTING AND

"Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE) ABSTRACT The goal of STRIDE (Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment) is to develop, test, and disseminate an integrated multi-level, culturally sensitive intervention to engage African Americans and Latinos in translational research. STRIDE is a partnership of the CTSAs at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Vanderbilt University, three geographically diverse areas with large numbers of African American and Latino constituents. Despite disparities in leading causes of death, morbidity and disability, African Americans and Latinos are under-represented in important translational research studies that have potential to reduce these disparities. Our team's prior work suggests that limited research literacy, defined as “the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information needed to make informed decisions about research participation,” often precludes research participation. Participant barriers also include lack of trust stemming from historical abuses. Research team members often lack skills in cultural competency and may not be sensitive to important issues faced by populations of color. Likewise, informed consent procedures contained within the research system may create confusion and disengagement of diverse participants. The multilevel STRIDE intervention will address these barriers at three levels: patient, research team, and system. The STRIDE intervention builds from synergistic work conducted at the three participating CTSA hubs that includes patient, research staff and systems (e-Consent) targeted interventions. Collectively, our approach will enable research personnel to recruit and deliver informed consent in a culturally competent, literacy appropriate manner, while also improving the “research literacy” of potential research participants. The participant component of the STRIDE intervention will draw upon the power of narrative intervention, or “storytelling,” by harnessing powerful stories from actual research participants describing their experiences, which will be incorporated in community-based outreach forums, the e-consent platform and in clinical settings. The research team component of the STRIDE intervention centers on an innovative application of medical simulation to improve the cultural competency of those recruiting and enrolling diverse participants in translational research. The systems component of the STRIDE intervention will be based on an innovative REDCap e-Consent platform adapted for cultural sensitivity to African American and Latinos and incorporates access to ancillary tools to enhance patient understanding. The project has three Specific Aims that correspond to three study phases. In Aim 1, the comprehensive intervention will be developed and pilot tested. In Aim 2, a multi-site interrupted time series design trial will be conducted to determine the impact of the STRIDE intervention on recruitment of African American and Latino participants in ongoing clinical trials. In Aim 3, dissemination activities will be conducted throughout the CTSA network and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos are not adequately represented in translational research, particularly given the widespread health disparities experienced by these groups. This study aims to develop, test and make widely available a multi-level intervention that is culturally and literacy appropriate to address this critical issue.",Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE),9525708,U01TR001812,"['Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Confusion ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Critiques ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Standardization ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Trust ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' Emotional ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' systems research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' stem ', ' translational clinical trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' trial design ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2018,1455713,0.04213946715503119
"Diet quality and cardiometabolic disparities among Latino ethnic subgroups DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal for this application for a NHLBI-K01 Faculty Diversity Mentored Career Development Award is to provide the candidate, Josiemer Mattei, PhD, MPH, with indispensable training to become an independent researcher in nutrition and cardio-metabolic disparities in Latinos, through epidemiological and intervention projects. These have been constructed along a comprehensive training program facilitated by a team of expert mentors in nutritional epidemiology, cardiovascular health, and community interventions.  Responding to the staggering prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other chronic disease in Latinos living in the United States (US), and to the limited studies on the dietary habits and cultural beliefs that may contribute to those disparities, the research aims are to (1) to identify diet quality indices within Latino ethnic subgroups in the US and to evaluate associations of such indices with traditional and emerging CVD risk factors within ethnicity, (2) to contrast diet quality of Puerto Ricans in the mainland US versus the island, and assess how it is associated with long-term cardio-metabolic factors; and (3) to assess deep-cultural factors (core beliefs and influences) related to diet and disease and determine efficacy of a pilot intervention based on such components for Latino subgroups on improving diet quality. Analyses for the first two aims will be conducted using data from the national Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos, the Boston Puerto Rican Health Study, and the San Juan Obese Adult Longitudinal Study in Puerto Rico. Latino multiethnic adults will be recruited for the mixed-methods formative and pilot studies to be conducted at the South End Community Health Center in Boston, MA. To match the scope of the proposed scientific work, this proposal includes five career-development and training areas: (1) research expertise through the proposed aims, (2) coursework in advanced epidemiological methods, and behavioral and community intervention methods, (3) multiple career-building activities to acquire essential tools for leadership and professional growth, as well as dissemination and translation of findings, (4) continued mentoring and monitoring by an outstanding team of senior mentors and an advisory committee; and (5) a detailed plan to expand grant support and collaborations with various national institutions. This K01 project will compellingly impact public health by bridging the gap in knowledge of traditional diet quality of specific Latino groups and how these may shape racial and ethnic disparities in CVD risk factors. The work will provide preliminary data to support longitudinal studies on diet and disease, and full-scale community trials on improving diet quality to reduce disease burden among Latinos. The project builds upon exceptional resources and mentoring at the candidate's institution (Harvard School of Public Health) and partnering organizations, to train her in key new areas, bolster applications for competitive funding, disseminate findings among researchers and the wider community, augment faculty diversity, and attain research independence.  (End of Abstract) NARRATIVE Latinos, the largest minority group in the United States, have an extremely high prevalence of cardio-metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. Nutritional strategies could help lower that burden, yet few data exist on the quality of the traditional diets of specific Latino subgroups in the US and their effect on risk of cardio-metabolic diseases, or on which cultural aspects of diet and disease may enhance community- based dietary interventions for Latinos. This proposal aims to bridge that gap by utilizing existing US Latino cohorts with robust data on diet and CVD risk factors to examine ethnic-specific association of diet quality with cardio-metabolic risk factors, and then apply those observational results into a pilot intervention culturally tailored for Latino ethnic subgroups to improve their diet quality.",Diet quality and cardiometabolic

"Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community members Recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, including skin and respiratory irritation and asthma, as well as potential reproductive effects and breast cancer. Nonetheless, the production and distribution of these products continues to expand. In response public health actions have aimed to reduce exposures through substituting use of environmentally safer products in public buildings and schools and encouraging development of certified environmentally safer product labels. While these initiatives have been successful at reaching certain groups of workers and consumers, low wage domestic and other cleaning workers, who are disproportionately immigrant and Latino, have been largely left out due to factors including knowledge, awareness, cost and accessibility. The Safe and Just Cleaners Project aims to address this environmental health disparity by documenting and reducing exposures to cleaning agents among domestic cleaning workers in the Latino immigrant worker community in NYC, as part of a University- Community partnership. The rationale for this project is that once domestic cleaners, as part of a large and influential community-based organization, gain capacity and knowledge to recognize their exposures and potential risks as workers, this will lay the basis for building a joint worker-community effort that will simultaneously a) improve conditions for themselves as cleaning workers, and b) reduce exposure to hazardous cleaning agents in the larger community of which the workers are a part. Working collaboratively with the largest Latino immigrant community-based organization in NYC, with 30,000 members, the project will survey Latino domestic workers about their use, work practices, values, knowledge and attitudes about potential hazards and self-reported health problems associated with consumer cleaning product use. The project will then identify and quantitatively evaluate the exposure levels and conditions that result in inhalation and dermal exposures to volatile organic and quaternary ammonium compounds, two major and potentially toxic components of commercial cleaning agents, among Latino immigrant domestic cleaning workers. The project will measure exposures both at the time of cleaning as well as residual exposures that might continue to contaminate home environments even after cleaning tasks are complete. These findings will be used to develop and implement a multilevel strategic campaign to reduce exposures among immigrant communities through local and national partnerships. Embedding this campaign within a workers’ rights and social justice perspective provides an approach that educates people about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures. Although recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, important populations of users of the agents - low wage domestic cleaning workers who are mainly immigrant and Latino - have inadequate knowledge and limited access to safer alternatives, whether using these products at work or at home. The Safe and Just Cleaners/Limpieza Sana y Justa Project will document exposures to cleaning agents among the Latino immigrant domestic cleaners in NYC. Using a workers’ rights and social justice perspective, the project’s public health campaign will inform Latino domestic cleaners and their communities about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures.",Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community members,9447558,R01ES027890,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Ammonia ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' Community Workers ', ' Disinfectants ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industrialization ', ' Influentials ', ' Irritants ', ' Joints ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Language ', ' New York ', ' Privatization ', ' Product Labeling ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Social Justice ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' skin irritation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Dermal ', ' Policies ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' irritation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' respiratory ', ' Inhalation Exposure ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' quaternary ammonium compound ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Allergic ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' reproductive ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Population ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' dermal exposure ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' citizen science ', ' community partnership ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIEHS,QUEENS COLLEGE,R01,2018,599342,0.03774989348207236
"Risk Factors For Worse Lung Function In Latinos With Cystic Fibrosis 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the second most common inherited childhood disease in the United States. CF is commonly thought of as a disease occurring only in whites; however, a third of patients in California are Latino. Latinos with CF have more severe lung disease and are 85% more likely to die annually than non-Latino white CF patients. Risk factors for severe lung function has been well-described in whites with CF, yet little is known about risk factors for severe lung function in Latinos. Our overall hypothesis is that Latinos have worse lung function than non-Latino Whites due to differences in the exposure and impact of risk factors that determine lung function in CF. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate if Latinos acquire different respiratory infections or if infections affect lung function differentially than among non-Latino whites (Aim 1). Maintenance medications improve lung function, but have not been studied specifically in Latinos. We will investigate the impact of these medications in Latinos (Aim 2). However, some important environmental and healthcare- related risk factors for lung function have not been collected by the CF Patient Registry. In our pilot cohort, we will recruit Latino and non-Latino white children with CF to collect data on these potential risk factors: air pollution, secondhand smoke, language spoken, and acculturation (Aim 3). To investigate medication response in Latinos, we will collect data about medical literacy and compliance (Aim 3). I have assembled a team of experienced scientists to address this critically important hypothesis, led by primary mentors Drs. Burchard and Nielson. I am well equipped to successfully accomplish these training and research goals with a foundation of formal training in pediatric pulmonary, pediatric clinical pharmacology, and clinical research and the support of my mentors. In order to become a successful independent investigator in health disparities in cystic fibrosis, I need further training and hands-on experience in the following areas: methods to study health disparities in minority populations; developing and managing a pediatric cohort study; training in advanced biostatistics and study design in CF research; and overall research career development. This proposed research may identify potentially modifiable risk factors that differentially affect lung function in Latinos with CF. Interventions targeting these identified risk factors could improve the health of Latinos with CF, allowing them to have longer and more fulfilling lives. Importantly, this proposed K23 research and training plan will provide me with the essential tools for a successful R01 application and to advance my career in CF research. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Compared to whites, Latinos with cystic fibrosis have more severe pulmonary disease and are more likely to die annually. This health disparity is a growing public health problem as Latinos represent an increasing proportion of cystic fibrosis patients. We propose to investigate potentially modifiable risk factors that may differentially contribute to Latinos with cystic fibrosis having worse pulmonary disease, in an effort to identify potential targets for intervention to improve morbidity and mortality in Latinos.",Risk Factors For Worse Lung Function In Latinos With Cystic Fibrosis,9452755,K23HL133437,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' California ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cystic Fibrosis ', ' Mucoviscidosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Language ', ' literacy ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung diseases ', ' lung disorder ', ' disorder of the lung ', ' disease of the lung ', ' Respiratory System Disorder ', ' Respiratory System Disease ', ' Respiratory Disease ', ' Pulmonary Disorder ', ' Pulmonary Diseases ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mucous body substance ', ' mucous ', ' Mucus ', ' Patients ', ' Clinical Pharmacology ', ' Public Health ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Respiratory Tract Infections ', ' Respiratory Infections ', ' Respiratory physiology ', ' respiratory function ', ' lung function ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Tobacco ', ' Training Support ', ' United States ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Lung damage ', ' lung injury ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Inherited ', ' Hereditary ', ' Severities ', ' experience ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Obstructive Lung Diseases ', ' respiratory airway obstruction ', ' obstructive airway disease ', ' recessive genetic trait ', ' recessive trait ', ' genetic recessive ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Environmental Tobacco Smoke ', ' secondhand smoke ', ' second hand smoke ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' patient registry ', ' Respiratory Failure ', ' respiratory insufficiency/failure ', ' pulmonary failure ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' anti-inflammatory effect ', ' Antiinflammatory Effect ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' health literacy ', ' exposure to tobacco ', ' tobacco exposure ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' pediatric cystic fibrosis ', ' cystic fibrosis preschoolers ', ' Children with CF ', ' CF Preschoolers ', ' children with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with cystic fibrosis ', ' patients with CF ', ' CF patients ', ' cystic fibrosis patients ', ' Population ', ' modifiable risk ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' genetic disorder ', ' genetic condition ', ' Genetic Diseases ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K23,2018,204182,0.15820950185581836
"Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Preschoolers: An Evidence Based Procedure Abstract Bilingual children are often misdiagnosed as having a speech disorder when they truly exhibit normal development. In addition, speech-language pathologists (SLP) are avoiding the assessment of bilingual children due to the lack of knowledge and resources necessary for best practice with this population. Misdiagnosis of speech sound disorders in this population has long-term emotional, financial, and educational costs. Misdiagnosis of speech disorders in bilingual children can be prevented if we acquire more information on what constitutes normal and disordered speech development in the bilingual population. The current research is designed to validate a model of speech sound production in bilinguals to frame a screening tool for Latino preschoolers. Due to differences in speech production found in bilingual preschoolers (Fabiano-Smith & Goldstein, 2010a; 2010b; Fabiano-Smith & Barlow, 2010), an assessment procedure that evaluates the speech of bilingual preschoolers that takes into account both English and Spanish is necessary to prevent misdiagnosis of speech sound disorders. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to (1) to validate our model of speech sound production in bilinguals, the PRIMIR 2 model and (2) to improve the existing version of the assessment procedure utilized in Phase 1 of our research using Item Response and Classical Test Theory approaches to reliability. Bilingual children with typical and disordered development will be compared to their English-speaking peers on measures of speech sound ability. Children will produce sounds in single words and their productions will be phonetically transcribed. Child productions will be examined, in both English and Spanish and across both languages, on common diagnostic measures used for monolingual children. Mixed effects regression models will be used to identify between-language interaction in bilingual speech and the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) will be used to determine sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic measures examined. Item Response Theory (IRT) will be used to identify a set of test items that are sensitive and specific to bilingual children with suspected speech sound disorders. Findings will lead to a characterization of typical and disordered speech sound development in bilingual children and diagnostic guidelines for speech-language pathologists to use in the differential diagnosis of speech difference from speech disorder. These findings will reduce diagnostic error in the identification of speech sound disorders in this population, reducing health disparities for Latino children. Latinos are the most populous minority group in the United States and children are the largest segment of the Latino population, comprising the majority of all children in some states (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010b, 2010c). This research will address a large and growing need: Reducing health disparities between Latinos and other racial and ethnic groups. The outcomes of this study will serve to impact (1) the lives of Latino children and their families by limiting the number of children misdiagnosed with speech sound disorders in the United States and (2) speech-language pathologists who are struggling to assess and diagnose the growing number of bilingual children on their caseloads.",Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Preschoolers: An Evidence Based Procedure,9593162,R01DC016624,"['Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Infant ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Production ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' wasting ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' phonology ', ' phonological ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Speech Development ', ' theories ', ' kindergarten ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' Diagnostic Specificity ', ' clinical test ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' research clinical testing ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' evidence base ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2018,593100,0.0568552401145703
"Linking Community and Family Characteristics to Adolescent Adjustment Latino youth in immigrant families are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. school population and face elevated risks of externalizing and internalizing problems and barriers to social and academic competence. Compromised adolescent adjustment harms youth and adult health and promotes inter-generational transmissions of inequality. Parenting processes are strong, malleable correlates of Latino youth adjustment. A glaring weakness in Latino parenting research is inadequate attention to extra-familial cultural demands and opportunities. These demands and opportunities include language use and co-ethnic concentration in neighborhoods; discrimination and support in school and peer contexts; Latino student concentration in schools; peer bullying victimization; and immigrant experiences tied to documentation status, discrimination, migration, and transnationalism. Gaps in research are pronounced for new immigrant destinations, where a lack of established co-ethnic enclaves and language barriers pose unique challenges for Latino families adjusting to life in the U.S. The main goal of this application is to specify the cascade of effects from extra-familial cultural demands and opportunities to Latino adolescent adjustment in an emerging immigrant area. Using culturally informed theory, multi-level data, and multiple mediator models, this research will test the hypothesis that Latino cultural inclusion and support in neighborhood, school, peer and immigrant contexts will lead to declines in youth's externalizing and internalizing problems and increases in youth's social and academic competence during adolescence. The study's mediating hypothesis is that Latino cultural inclusion and support external to the family will influence youth outcomes indirectly by reducing acculturation-related stress (immigrant stressors such as deportation fears, social isolation, and language barriers; parent-child acculturation gaps; demands on youth language brokering) and, in turn, increasing effective parenting (supportive parenting, parental monitoring, family cohesion, low conflict). Effective parenting is hypothesized to be associated reciprocally with adolescents' positive adjustment. Tests of moderated mediation will examine variations in pathways to youth outcomes by adolescents' gender, age, length of U.S. residence, and transition to high school. Using an intentionally missing data design, this study will have 8 time points of data spanning 6th to 11th grade for 600 Latino parent-youth dyads representative of Latinos in a suburban Atlanta school district. The PI's research and partnerships with the school district strengthen feasibility for the proposed study. Data will be analyzed using multilevel, structural equation modeling. In a key departure from individual- and family-level studies, this study will use an integrated theoretical model of culturally relevant extra-familial factors salient to acculturation stressors, parenting, and Latino adolescent adjustment. Results will identify the timing and targets of culture-specific policies and programs enhancing family interventions in new immigrant areas. As one-third of K-12 U.S. students will be Latino in less than a decade, results will inform efforts to reduce the public health burden of poor adjustment among the U.S. school population. Increases in the U.S. Latino population, rapid growth in new immigrant areas, and current policy debates around immigration underscore the timely need for this research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will assess how cultural demands and opportunities in neighborhood, school, peer and immigrant contexts influence acculturation-related stressors and, in turn, parenting processes and adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problems and social and academic competence. Study activities include the collection and analysis of eight time points of survey data over a period of four years for a school-based sample of adolescents (n = 600) and, for a random 50% of participating youth, their mothers (n = 300) in an emerging immigrant destination in suburban Atlanta. Findings will identify the timing and targets of culture-specific policies, programs, and community cultural supports that can enhance existing family-based interventions for Latino youth, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. school population.",Linking Community and Family Characteristics to Adolescent Adjustment,9553382,R01HD090232,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Attention ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Immigration ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Destinations ', ' Gender ', ' Competence ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' suburb ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Glare ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' intergenerational ', ' high school ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' eleventh grade ', ' high school junior ', ' 11th grade ', ' social ', ' parental monitoring ', ' parent monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' school district ', ' K-12 student ', ' ']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,524431,0.0634971726675798
"Adaptation and Pilot Feasibility of a Psychotherapy Intervention for Latinos with Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Latinos are at higher risk of poorer psychological and quality of life outcomes when compared to non-Hispanic white patients and other minority patients and commonly report using spiritual strategies to cope with cancer. Maintaining hope, spiritual well-being and finding meaning in the cancer experience is critical for the adjustment and well-being of advanced cancer patients. However, there are no targeted psychosocial or psychotherapeutic interventions available for Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer. Meaning-Centered psychotherapy (MCP) is a novel psychotherapeutic intervention designed to help patients with advanced cancer sustain or enhance a sense of meaning, peace and purpose as they approach the end-of-life. The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and pilot Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy with Spanish-speaking Latinos (MCP-L) diagnosed with advanced cancer. The first aim of this study is to translate and culturally adapt the Meaning Centered Psychotherapy intervention manual guided by the Ecological Validity Framework, based on our previous formative research and with information gathered by interviewing 15 key informants and a pre- pilot of key sections of MCP-L with 10 Spanish-speaking Latinos patients. The second aim is to determine its feasibility and acceptability, and to generate preliminary data on impact (improvement of spiritual well-being, quality of life and reduction of depression, anxiety, and hopelessness) of the culturally adapted version of MCP- L by conducting a randomized controlled pilot trial. My long-term goal is to become an independent clinical researcher and an expert in the cultural adaptation field of psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions with minority cancer patients. This application will allow me to acquire the training and mentored research experience and obtain additional training in: (1) Transcreation and cultural adaptation of interventions; (2) Psychotherapy theory research and process research, (3) Mixed methods approaches, (4) Design, implementation and evaluation of randomized controlled trials with Latino patients, and (5) Dissemination and implementation science. I am proposing a mix of guided mentoring, didactic training, coursework, webinars, seminars and tutorials, directed readings, conferences, and hands-on research activities that will facilitate the development of research skills and enable me to gain experience in these areas. This proposal is responsive to the priorities of the NCI Strategic Plan, to study and identify factors contributing to disparities, develop culturally appropriate approaches, and disseminate interventions to overcome health disparities across the cancer control continuum from disease prevention to end-of-life care. The research agenda will allow me to acquire the research skills to become a successful independent investigator in the important field of cultural adaptation of psychosocial interventions for ethnic minority cancer patients. The study findings will be used to submit a competitive NIH R01 application to conduct a large randomized controlled trial of Meaning Centered Psychotherapy with Spanish-speaking patients diagnosed with advanced cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because it addresses the critical lack of palliative cancer care interventions for the Spanish-speaking population. NCI recognizes that minorities and other underserved populations bear a far greater cancer burden than the general population. NCI aims to overcome cancer disparities by promoting research to understand the underlying causes and contributing factors of cancer treatment and survival disparities, and by accelerating the dissemination and implementation of interventions to address cancer health disparities. Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer are at risk for poor mental health outcomes.

"2/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center Overall- Project Summary The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically, the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican- Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics, Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos. Project Narrative The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at an ISUPS (FAMU), and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC.

"1/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center Overall- Project Summary The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically, the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican- Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics, Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos. Project Narrative The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at an ISUPS (FAMU), and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC.

"Adoption of mHealth among Latinos with Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Project Summary  Cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) —a cluster of risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes is a significant public health concern in the US, positioning cardiovascular disease as the leading cause of death in the country. Latinos have higher incidence for CMRF compared to non- Hispanic whites. Due to a number of sociodemographic and cultural barriers such as lack of insurance, lack of transportation, or language discordance, Latinos with CMRF often have difficulty managing their health condition which often results in increased CHD, stroke, and heart failure. Evidence consistently shows that mobile health (mHealth), which includes SMS facilitated patient-provider communication, telephone counseling, smartphone applications, and medical peripheral devices to monitor and access health related information, is effective in improving CMRF. While there has been an increased penetration of mobile phones in Latinos, with a reported 87% cell phone ownership, there are limited mHealth interventions explored in Latinos who suffer the most from CMRF. In order to facilitate the implementation of mHealth in CMRF self-management and improve the health outcomes of the Latinos with CMRF, this study aims to examine the factors that influence the adoption of mHealth among Latinos with CMRF using a mixed methods design. A modified Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) reveals how health beliefs, attitudes and mHealth literacy—one's ability to understand and use mHealth—influence Latino's motivation to manage their CMRF by adopting mHealth. The proposed aims are as follows: 1) To examine the relationship among health beliefs (Perceived Health Risks and Health Consciousness), Perceived Usefulness, and levels of mHealth Adoption among Latinos with CMRF. 2) To examine the role of mHealth literacy in mHealth Adoption. 3) To explore the individual experiences of Latinos with CMRF in the United States to elicit barriers and facilitators of mHealth adoption. 4) To generate a comprehensive understanding of how cultural and social norms of Latinos with CMRF influence mHealth adoption, using an explanatory sequential design. An understanding of the Latino patients with CMRF in terms of their characteristics, perceptions and sociocultural norms and how they influence the Latino patients' adoption of mHealth can help inform the design of a patient- centered mHealth intervention and facilitate its implementation. The proposed study fits the strategic plan of the NINR as it supports research targeted at using innovative technologies to facilitate self- management of chronic diseases. The training plan will provide the requisite individualized and mentored experiences to develop knowledge and professional skills in nursing science, cardiovascular research, digital health technologies and health disparities research.   Project Narrative Cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRF) —a cluster of risk factors, including obesity, high fasting blood sugar, high blood pressure, high triglyceride, and low HDL cholesterol, that raises one's risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) and diabetes, contributes to mortality and rising health care costs and in the US. Latinos experience higher morbidity for CMRF than non-Hispanic whites (41% vs. 32%) and despite consistent evidence that shows improvement in self management of CMRF using mobile health (mHealth) technologies, there have been limited mHealth interventions explored in Latinos.

"Bridging Neglect: improved access to high-quality heart health information and care for communities at risk of Chagas disease Summary Chagas disease is a neglected disease that affects around 3,400 individuals in Massachusetts and around 300,000 in the United States. Infection with the Chagas parasite Trypanosoma cruzi can be transmitted vertically to the child in around 5% of pregnant mothers. Efforts to address Chagas disease are nearly non- existent in the U.S. Medical professionals and at-risk communities lack awareness of the disease, which leads to cardiac death in 20-30% of the infected. Latino communities at risk for Chagas disease also have low health literacy and have experienced less educational outreach regarding other heart health factors like obesity, diabetes and smoking prevention. We are building on the Strong Hearts project in East Boston, Massachusetts, that combines community outreach and education with facilitation of screening and referral for treatment of Chagas disease. Expertise in medical library science, clinical Infectious Disease and experience in Latino community outreach and education will synergize to optimize outreach using Latino communities’ favored social media. In-person, print, visual media and web-based knowledge provision will complement smartphone messaging, leveraging well-established community partnerships. Library sciences students will gain experience in providing medical information in optimally attractive forms, with an option of nationwide dissemination. Narrative Latino communities at risk for Chagas disease suffer from health disparities. We will leverage medical library science and clinical infectious disease expertise as well as experience in Latino community outreach to inform at-risk communities on this neglected disease.

"The Physiological and Relational Bases of Persistent Posttraumatic Stress in Latino Immigrant Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The number of immigrant families in the U.S. has rapidly increased across the last five years, with particular growth among Latinos from Central America (USCBP, 2016). Among Latino immigrant youth, posttraumatic stress symptoms (PSS) are a major public health concern—with our own pilot data showing that 60% of immigrant children and adolescents experience clinically significant PSS (Venta & Mercado, 2018), in contrast to less than 15% in non-immigrant groups (Foa et al., 2011). Our data indicate that the mean level of PSS is 161% - 204% higher in immigrant youth than prior estimates in non-immigrants (Venta & Mercado, 2018). Empirical and meta-analytic findings support an inflammatory hypothesis of PSS: elevations in systemic inflammatory biomarkers following trauma increase risk for persistent, impairing PSS (Gill et al., 2009). Conversely, close relationships—like those between parents and their children—have been repeatedly associated with reduced systemic inflammation (Fagundes et al., 2011). While the level of trauma exposure that immigrant children experience prior to migration represents a static risk factor for PSS, inflammatory response, in contrast, represents a dynamic risk factor that may be mitigated through close relationships, reducing likelihood of persistent PSS after migration. The broad aim of this proposal is to examine the physiological (i.e., increased inflammatory response) and relational (i.e., parent-child relationship as a buffer) bases of persistent PSS, a condition that is dramatically overrepresented in Latino immigrants. The study proposes to recruit N = 100 Latino recent immigrant families for new longitudinal research spanning twelve months. Methods assess multiple levels of analysis: an experimental task of caregiver mentalizing, a semi- structured interview of caregiver-child attachment security, self- and caregiver-reports of PSS, and a two-time point salivary test of inflammatory response. Specific Aim 1 is to test an inflammation-based hypothesis of PSS. Trauma exposure, inflammatory response (measured via saliva collected before and after a stress induction), and PSS will be assessed at baseline; PSS will be assessed again at six- and twelve-month follow- up. It is expected that trauma exposure will be associated with greater inflammation response at baseline, which, in turn, will be associated with persistent PSS. Specific Aim 2 is to examine the potential protective effects of the parent-child relationship in the inflammation-based hypothesis of PSS. Parent-child relationship factors (i.e., caregiver mentalizing and caregiver-child attachment) will be assessed at baseline and examined as moderators of the risk hypothesis posited in Aim 1. In sum, novel data collected in this study will test a physiological mechanism underlying a significant health disparity—that Latino immigrant youth are disproportionately affected by PSS— as well as test the protective role of putative intervention targets (i.e., parent-child relationships) in ameliorating risk for persistent PSS. The proposed study will enhance research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students via paid, hands-on roles in high-impact research. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latino immigrant children are disproportionately affected by posttraumatic stress symptoms, therefore there is a critical public health need to understand risk and protective factors related to the persistence of these symptoms in the post-migration U.S. context. The proposed study will test both a physiological mechanism underlying this disparity—increased inflammatory response—and the protective effects of parent-child relationship factors in mitigating risk for persistent posttraumatic stress symptoms post-migration; the sample is drawn from a population that is disproportionately affected by posttraumatic stress and rapidly growing in the U.S. and Texas (data collection site), recently immigrated Latino families. This study will provide novel data on a critical need in minority mental health, posttraumatic stress symptoms, by linking this outcome to a disease mechanism at the physiological level and to protective factors representing putative intervention targets for future research.",The Physiological and Relational Bases of Persistent Posttraumatic Stress in Latino Immigrant Youth,9812524,R15MD014302,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biology ', ' Buffers ', ' Central America ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Gills ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parents ', ' Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Site ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Inflammatory ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Salivary ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Intercept ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' graduate student ', ' Reporting ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Sum ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Security ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' informant ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' migration ', ' protective effect ', ' Trauma ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' experimental analysis ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Secure ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' Non-traditional Students ', ' Nontraditional Students ', ' hands on research ', ' stress symptom ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Longitudinal prospective study ', ' Longterm prospective studies ', ' Long-term prospective studies ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' ']",NIMHD,SAM HOUSTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R15,2019,406491,0.019694204371967
"Delaying Licensure: Latino Teens Riding with Impaired Drivers and Impaired Driving 7. PROJECT SUMMARY For U.S. Latinos, disparities exist in the areas of driving while intoxicated (DWI) arrests and fatal alcohol- related motor vehicle crashes. This is evident despite research showing that Latinos do not drink and drive more often than their Non-Latino White counterparts. Further, Latinos are more likely to ride as passengers in private vehicles and are at a higher risk of riding with an alcohol/drug impaired driver (RWI). This risk is high among Latino teens and young adults. Their high RWI rates are a major public health concern as RWI is known as an antecedent and strong predictor of future DWI. These findings prompt two critical questions, “How is it that Latino teens, despite driving less, and drinking and driving less than their Non-Latino White peers, are overrepresented in alcohol-related arrests and crashes as adults?” and “Can we develop interventions to stop such a risky development?” Understanding the pathways to RWI/DWI along the life course of adolescence into emerging adulthood would greatly inform the development of focused prevention policies and interventions. Currently, little is known about developmental pathways to RWI/DWI among Latinos teens. Adding to this void in knowledge are two recent salient secular trends that present a major challenge for youth; many teens are intentionally delaying driving licensure (DDL) until age 18 or later to avoid teen-driver safety restrictions required by state graduated driver licensing (GDL) laws (when 15-17 y/o can drive only with adult supervision and/or under restrictions for passengers/nighttime driving) and Latinos in early/mid-adolescence now have a higher prevalence of alcohol and drug use than their peers of other racial and ethnic groups. For those 18 y/o inexperienced drivers who DDL, they have greater risk of serious and fatal crash involvement, particularly if they choose to use alcohol and/or drugs. There is concern this problem is particularly severe among Latinos, a group with a relatively elevated number of 18 y/o with little or no driving experience. This fact coupled with the noted increased prevalence of alcohol and drug use in Latino teens further emphasizes the importance and need of our proposed research as it relates to disparities in DDL, RWI, DWI, and alcohol-related fatal crashes. Our ultimate long-term research goal is to develop interventions to address this disparate source of health risk. To do so, we first propose a robust analysis of very recent adolescent health data that will guide the initial steps toward advancing the understanding of the relationships between DDL/GDL/RWI/DWI and thoroughly informing a succeeding R01 application focused on design and implementation of an effective theory-driven multilevel intervention program. Using national longitudinal adolescent health and fatal crash data, we will examine individual, family, and social factors that may be contributing to DDL in Latino teens. Also, we will examine relationships between DDL and GDL and episodes of RWI/DWI as well as fatal crashes. Successful completion of the proposed aims will provide pivotal epidemiological evidence to inform effective interventions that will save lives and eliminate related health disparities. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Recent research suggests that graduated driver licensing (GDL) laws have been disparate in their safety benefit among Latinos teens. We will rigorously examine factors that appear to be leading Latino teens to delay driving licensure (DDL), explore how these factors are influenced by GDL laws, and evaluate the contribution of these factors in Latino teens' high rates of riding with impaired drivers (RWI), as well as driving while impaired (DWI) and fatal crash involvement. Our research findings will advance the understanding of processes contributing to DDL, their influence on RWI/DWI, and provide new knowledge that will ultimately inform the development of effective interventions that will save lives and eliminate associated health disparities.",Delaying Licensure: Latino Teens Riding with Impaired Drivers and Impaired Driving,9769602,R21AA026346,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Behavior ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Laws ', ' Licensure ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' male ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Supervision ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Motor Vehicles ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Licensing ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Knowledge ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' peer ', ' drinking ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' risk perception ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Driving While Intoxicated ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Fatality rate ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' Teenagers ', ' teenage ', ' teen years ', ' Teen ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' impaired driving performance ', ' driving while impaired ', ' Impaired Driving ', ' teen driving ', ' teenage driving ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Coupled ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Impairment ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' emerging adulthood ', ' health data ', ' social media ', ' adolescent health ', ' driving skills ', ' ']",NIAAA,YALE UNIVERSITY,R21,2019,234410,0.17775315789752438
"Understanding disparities in alcohol treatment services utilization PROJECT SUMMARY: Understanding disparities in alcohol treatment services utilization Introduction: Despite their high need for treatment, Latinos greatly underutilize specialty alcohol treatment. Evidence suggests that Latinos are less likely to use specialty alcohol treatment than other racial/ethnic groups, with the greatest disparity being between Latinos and Whites. Underutilization of specialty treatment is particularly pronounced among Latina women and Latinos low in acculturation. Researchers have suggested that Latinos may experience more barriers to accessing specialty treatment than other racial/ethnic groups. However, studies examining treatment barriers by race/ethnicity are scant, are inconclusive, and face multiple methodological limitations. Aims: In Aim 1, we seek to validate a newly developed, theoretically informed, measure that will sensitively capture key barriers to explain Latino-White disparities in the use of specialty alcohol treatment. In Aim 2, we seek to determine which treatment barriers are most significant to Latinos (vs. Whites). Aim 3 will compare treatment barriers among Latinos only to better understand gender and acculturation disparities. Design and Methods: The proposed study will consist of two phases. In Phase I, we will recruit 40 White and Latino participants with recent (i.e., past-5-year) alcohol use disorders (AUD) for cognitive interviews to further refine our novel, theory-driven scale: The Barriers to Specialty Alcohol Treatment Scale (BSAT). The BSAT was informed by findings from a recently completed pilot study and the Theory of Planned Behavior. Barriers are measured using a 5-point Likert scale response. Data from these interviews will inform the refinement, deletion, and creation of items, resulting in a finalized BSAT scale. In Phase II, we will recruit a national sample of 1,200 White and Latino participants with recent AUD to complete a structured questionnaire that will include the BSAT, resulting from Phase I. Measures of alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, problem severity, mental health status, acculturation, and socio-demographics will also be collected. These data will be used to conduct psychometric testing for scale validation (Aim 1). We will also conduct separate linear regression models analyzing each barrier as an outcome, while controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and potential confounders, to (a) test for Latino-White differences (Aim 2) and (b) gender and acculturation differences (among Latinos-only; Aim 3). Participants in both phases will be recruited via web panels, a cost- effective approach to effectively sample our target population. Impact: The proposed study is significant because it will uncover new knowledge that is critical to the development of effective and culturally tailored intervention strategies that meet the specific needs of Latinos with AUD and can reduce existing racial/ethnic health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This alcohol treatment services utilization study is focused on understanding barriers that contribute to Latino- White disparities in the use of specialty alcohol treatment. Underutilization of specialty alcohol treatment by Latinos, the largest and fastest growing minority racial/ethnic group, is troublesome given that these services have been shown to be effective regardless of race/ethnicity. Findings will address gaps in our understanding of barriers that prevent people from seeking and receiving appropriate care for alcohol use disorders and will aid in the development of strategies to enhance treatment use.",Understanding disparities in alcohol treatment services utilization,9801182,R01AA027767,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Attitude ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Goals ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' parity ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' service utilization ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' family support ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' cognitive interview ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,369837,0.041396395699217325
"Culturally Competent Communication Intervention to Improve Latinos' Engagement in Advance Care Planning PROJECT SUMMARY Compared to whites, Latinos are much less likely to engage in various forms of advance care planning (ACP), including completing advance directives and having end-of-life (EOL) discussions. ACP is critical to provision of quality EOL care, as it has been associated with greater likelihood of patients' EOL wishes being followed. Latino advanced cancer patients are also significantly more likely than their white counterparts to receive futile and burdensome aggressive care at the end-of-life, to die in the ICU, and to have care that runs counter to their preferences and values. Dr. Shen's pilot work, along with the current literature, suggests that targeting ACP may help improve Latinos' EOL care. As such, the proposed project will develop and pilot-test a culturally competent communication (CCC) intervention. First, the CCC intervention will be developed based on results from a questionnaire embedded into a current R01 (MPIs: Prigerson, Maciejewski) assessing Latinos' cultural, familial, and religious beliefs as well as their knowledge, motivation (readiness), and action to engage in ACP (n=200). Next, the developed CCC intervention will be vetted among Latino stakeholders and field-tested among Latino advanced cancer patients, using an iterative approach (n=40) to guide the finalization of the intervention. Finally, a pilot randomized trial will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the CCC intervention at improving engagement in ACP. Participants (n=50) will be randomly assigned to the intervention (n=25) or attention control group (n=25). Results will provide timely insight into a potentially effective, low burden intervention designed to improve Latinos' engagement in ACP. Dr. Shen is the ideal candidate to spearhead this line of research given her academic background in social psychology and communication research. Dr. Shen's long-term career goal is to lead a program of social scientific research that develops social psychological interventions designed to improve EOL communication and care, with expertise in interventions targeting racial/ethnic minorities. To achieve this goal, as part of her K07, Dr. Shen will receive intensive training in five key areas: (1) EOL care research; (2) clinical intervention development; (3) technology-based health interventions; (4) health disparities, and (5) professional development. The K07 will provide Dr. Shen with several avenues to achieve her training and research goals and enhance her expertise. Dr. Shen will have ongoing meetings with mentors and expert advisors and participate in formal coursework, didactics, workshops, conferences, interactive trainings, and guided research experience. The proposed K07 will form the foundation for a program of research that focuses on developing social psychological interventions to improve EOL communication and care. At the end of the K07 funding period, Dr. Shen will submit an R01 application, based on the results of the present study. Overall, the K07 will provide Dr. Shen with the research experience, intensive training, and mentorship needed to become a successful independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has significant public health relevance and is consistent with the broader goals of public health focuses on improving communication regarding end-of-life care. The development of a Culturally Competent Communication Intervention designed to coach Latino advanced cancer patients in how to communicate EOL goals of care in order to improve their engagement in advance care planning will help reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in advance care planning and potentially end-of-life care. If the Culturally Competent Communication Intervention proves to be potentially efficacious, there is a strong argument for testing this intervention in a larger, multi-site study to test for effectiveness.",Culturally Competent Communication Intervention to Improve Latinos' Engagement in Advance Care Planning,9736266,K07CA207580,"['Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Belief ', ' Communication ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Control Groups ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Motivation ', ' Names ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Do Not Resuscitate ', ' Do Not Resuscitate Order ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Proxy ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' social ', ' end of life care ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Dominican ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Communication Research ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' social communication ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' end-of-life communication ', ' end of life communication ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' attentional control ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K07,2019,172260,0.13521113534248588
"Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE) ABSTRACT The goal of STRIDE (Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment) is to develop, test, and disseminate an integrated multi-level, culturally sensitive intervention to engage African Americans and Latinos in translational research. STRIDE is a partnership of the CTSAs at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Vanderbilt University, three geographically diverse areas with large numbers of African American and Latino constituents. Despite disparities in leading causes of death, morbidity and disability, African Americans and Latinos are under-represented in important translational research studies that have potential to reduce these disparities. Our team's prior work suggests that limited research literacy, defined as “the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information needed to make informed decisions about research participation,” often precludes research participation. Participant barriers also include lack of trust stemming from historical abuses. Research team members often lack skills in cultural competency and may not be sensitive to important issues faced by populations of color. Likewise, informed consent procedures contained within the research system may create confusion and disengagement of diverse participants. The multilevel STRIDE intervention will address these barriers at three levels: patient, research team, and system. The STRIDE intervention builds from synergistic work conducted at the three participating CTSA hubs that includes patient, research staff and systems (e-Consent) targeted interventions. Collectively, our approach will enable research personnel to recruit and deliver informed consent in a culturally competent, literacy appropriate manner, while also improving the “research literacy” of potential research participants. The participant component of the STRIDE intervention will draw upon the power of narrative intervention, or “storytelling,” by harnessing powerful stories from actual research participants describing their experiences, which will be incorporated in community-based outreach forums, the e-consent platform and in clinical settings. The research team component of the STRIDE intervention centers on an innovative application of medical simulation to improve the cultural competency of those recruiting and enrolling diverse participants in translational research. The systems component of the STRIDE intervention will be based on an innovative REDCap e-Consent platform adapted for cultural sensitivity to African American and Latinos and incorporates access to ancillary tools to enhance patient understanding. The project has three Specific Aims that correspond to three study phases. In Aim 1, the comprehensive intervention will be developed and pilot tested. In Aim 2, a multi-site interrupted time series design trial will be conducted to determine the impact of the STRIDE intervention on recruitment of African American and Latino participants in ongoing clinical trials. In Aim 3, dissemination activities will be conducted throughout the CTSA network and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos are not adequately represented in translational research, particularly given the widespread health disparities experienced by these groups. This study aims to develop, test and make widely available a multi-level intervention that is culturally and literacy appropriate to address this critical issue.",Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE),9734190,U01TR001812,"['Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Confusion ', ' Critiques ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Standardization ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Trust ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Active Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' tool ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Complex ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Emotional ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' systems research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community organizations ', ' stem ', ' translational clinical trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' trial design ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2019,1116854,0.04213946715503119
"Self-regulation development and the transition to middle school Self-regulation and the transition to middle school  The transition from elementary to middle school often precipitates a downward spiral in academic performance characterized by declining grades, academic disengagement, and eventual high school drop-out. During this same period, risky behaviors such as substance abuse and sexual risk-taking increase. Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition. Disentangling the factors contributing to the academic success/failure of low-income African American and Latino youth requires viewing development as a complex developmental process with “intertwined developmental trajectories, social pathways, and social convoys” (Benner, 2011). For low-income African American and Latino youth in particular, it is important to consider the intersection of social class, culture, and ethnicity for children of color transitioning to middle school. Life course theory suggests that early life stress can have a cumulative effect on development. Accordingly, individual level vulnerabilities at multiple levels of the youth ecology (individual, family, school, and neighborhood) can be potentiated during times of exposure to additional normative stressors, such as developmental transition points. Minority youth from low-SES families not only experience difficulties associated with poverty but also cultural stress (e.g., assimilation, discrimination) which undermine their ability to face normative stressors such as transitioning into middle school.  We propose to follow a large cohort of low-income African American and Latino children first enrolled at age 2½ as part of the Dallas Preschool Readiness Project (DPReP) as they transition into middle school. DPReP participants have completed four waves of data collection that have included measures of emerging self- regulation skills, academic achievement, and behavior problems. By following this sample into middle school, we will characterize trajectories of self-regulation development to address the following primary aims: Aim 1. Examine how individual differences in trajectories of self-regulation development from 2½ years into  middle school are related to differences in academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school for  low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 2. Examine how the interrelated contexts of family, school and neighborhood contribute to the middle  school academic and behavioral adjustment of low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 3. Examine how the relation of family, school, and neighborhood contexts to academic and behavioral  adjustment in middle school is both mediated and moderated by self-regulation skills among low-  income African Americans and Latinos. Data collection methods will include home visits, phone interviews, teacher surveys, and classroom and neighborhood observations. Measures include child self-regulation, assessments of academic performance and social competence, family environment, classroom environment, teacher-child relationship, and neighborhood conditions. Analytic methods will include structural equations modeling, and latent differences models. Project Narrative The transition from elementary to middle school often precipitates a downward spiral in academic performance characterized by declining grades, academic disengagement, and eventual high school drop-out. Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition, and the stark race/ethnic disparities in high school graduation rates and educational attainment likely reflect its long- term consequences. Children with better self-regulation in early childhood display better academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school. In this study, we will follow a cohort of 365 low-income African American and Latino children originally enrolled at age 2½ and reassessed at age 3½, kindergarten, and first grade to conduct additional assessments in 4th through 7th grade to examine the role of self-regulation skills, family-level processes and neighborhood conditions in explaining academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school.",Self-regulation development and the transition to middle school,9733312,R01HD075311,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Buffers ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Interview ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Social Class ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Assimilations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' analytical method ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Exposure to ', ' Complex ', ' first grade ', ' 1st grade ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' seventh grade ', ' 7th grade ', ' social skills ', ' social competency ', ' social competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' kindergarten ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Home visitation ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' critical period ', ' early adolescence ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' Middle School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' school atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' education atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' college atmosphere ', ' classroom environment ', ' Graduation Rates ', ' Attainment Rate ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic identity ', ' early life stress ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2019,595182,0.050536777385074325
"Social Stress Epigenetics and Cardio-Metabolic Health Among Latinos Latinos, the largest ethnic minority group in the United States, have a high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity and also experience higher rates of poverty and social stressors in both childhood and adulthood compared to other racial/ethnic groups. There is extensive evidence that economic and social stressors shape the development of cardiometabolic health. However, it is largely unknown how these stressors affect biological processes, particularly at the cellular level. One novel method to evaluate possible mechanisms underlying the associations between social stressors and cardiometabolic health across the life course is DNA methylation (DNAm). Recently a handful of small cross-sectional studies have found that stressful experiences may alter DNAm, thus providing a potential mechanism by which social stress may get under the skin. Most of the existing health research among Latinos has been specific to Latinos of Mexican origin. Latinos are not a homogenous group and while some Latinos are at greater risk of certain chronic conditions, other Latino groups may be at lower risk for certain conditions. Examining what factors may confer risk to some Latino ethnic groups or protect other Latino ethnic groups is crucial for developing interventions and informing decisions about resource allocation. We propose to examine the association between social and economic stressors, across the life course in relation to DNAm, as well as the rate of change of methylation and changes in cardiometabolic health, using existing data from the Hispanic Community Health Study /Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The HCHS/SOL study is a longitudinal study of US Latinos, representing varied countries of origin, conducted in the US. We propose to use existing data from a stratified random sample of 500 men and 500 women, who completed an extensive set of socio-economic and stress measures in the HCHS/SOL Sociocultural Ancillary study and who provided blood samples at two different time points six years apart in adulthood. Existing blood samples will be assayed for genome-wide DNAm and DNAm age. Cardiometabolic health markers (obesity, diabetes, hypertension and lipids) have also been assessed at two time points. Existing data also includes repeated assessments of social and economic stressors and socio-cultural factors (i.e., nativity, familism, acculturation, social support). Specifically, we will examine 1) whether social and economic stressors in childhood and adulthood are associated with changes in DNAm age and genome-wide methylation over a 6-year period; 2) whether sociocultural factors modify the association between stressors and changes in DNAm and 3) whether DNAm is associated with changes in cardiometabolic health over a 6-year period. Upon completion of this project, our findings will advance understanding of how social and economic stressors shape epigenetic pathways, what factors may exacerbate or ameliorate these pathways and whether epigenetic changes over time influence cardiometabolic health changes. Project Narrative Economic and social stressors are increasingly recognized as important factors that shape the development of cardiometabolic health particularly among Latinos, who experience a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease. However, particularly at the cellular level, biological pathways through which stress affects health disparities are not fully understood. We propose to address these gaps by examining the independent and cumulative impact of both economic and social stressors across the life course in relation to DNA methylation (e.g. DNA methylation age and genome-wide methylation) among a diverse sample of Latinos living in the US, whether modifying factors relevant to Latino populations may ameliorate or exacerbate this relation as well as how these epigenetic factors may impact cardiometabolic health.",Social Stress Epigenetics and Cardio-Metabolic Health Among Latinos,9764843,R01MD013320,"['Acceleration ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Child Abuse ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronology ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Inflammation ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lipids ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Poverty ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Glucocorticoid Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Biological Aging ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Mexican ', ' Policies ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dominican ', ' NR3C1 gene ', ' NR3C1 ', ' Receptor Gene ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' rate of change ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ', ' HCHS/SOL cohort ', ' HCHS/SOL Study ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Cuban ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,722807,0.0838366964612906
"Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Preschoolers: An Evidence Based Procedure Abstract Bilingual children are often misdiagnosed as having a speech disorder when they truly exhibit normal development. In addition, speech-language pathologists (SLP) are avoiding the assessment of bilingual children due to the lack of knowledge and resources necessary for best practice with this population. Misdiagnosis of speech sound disorders in this population has long-term emotional, financial, and educational costs. Misdiagnosis of speech disorders in bilingual children can be prevented if we acquire more information on what constitutes normal and disordered speech development in the bilingual population. The current research is designed to validate a model of speech sound production in bilinguals to frame a screening tool for Latino preschoolers. Due to differences in speech production found in bilingual preschoolers (Fabiano-Smith & Goldstein, 2010a; 2010b; Fabiano-Smith & Barlow, 2010), an assessment procedure that evaluates the speech of bilingual preschoolers that takes into account both English and Spanish is necessary to prevent misdiagnosis of speech sound disorders. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to (1) to validate our model of speech sound production in bilinguals, the PRIMIR 2 model and (2) to improve the existing version of the assessment procedure utilized in Phase 1 of our research using Item Response and Classical Test Theory approaches to reliability. Bilingual children with typical and disordered development will be compared to their English-speaking peers on measures of speech sound ability. Children will produce sounds in single words and their productions will be phonetically transcribed. Child productions will be examined, in both English and Spanish and across both languages, on common diagnostic measures used for monolingual children. Mixed effects regression models will be used to identify between-language interaction in bilingual speech and the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) will be used to determine sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic measures examined. Item Response Theory (IRT) will be used to identify a set of test items that are sensitive and specific to bilingual children with suspected speech sound disorders. Findings will lead to a characterization of typical and disordered speech sound development in bilingual children and diagnostic guidelines for speech-language pathologists to use in the differential diagnosis of speech difference from speech disorder. These findings will reduce diagnostic error in the identification of speech sound disorders in this population, reducing health disparities for Latino children. Latinos are the most populous minority group in the United States and children are the largest segment of the Latino population, comprising the majority of all children in some states (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010b, 2010c). This research will address a large and growing need: Reducing health disparities between Latinos and other racial and ethnic groups. The outcomes of this study will serve to impact (1) the lives of Latino children and their families by limiting the number of children misdiagnosed with speech sound disorders in the United States and (2) speech-language pathologists who are struggling to assess and diagnose the growing number of bilingual children on their caseloads.",Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Preschoolers: An Evidence Based Procedure,9744675,R01DC016624,"['Clinical Testing ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' evidence base ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Preventive service ', ' Preventative service ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Infant ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Production ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screening tools ', ' wasting ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' phonology ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Speech Development ', ' theories ', ' kindergarten ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' Diagnostic Specificity ', ' research clinical testing ', ' clinical test ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2019,585010,0.0568552401145703
"Mechanisms of Behavior Change in a Cultural Adaptation of Motivational Interviewing Proposal Summary/Abstract Project Title: Mechanisms of Behavior Change in Culturally Adapted Motivational Interviewing The NIAAA Five Year Strategic Plan prioritizes health disparities research for socially disadvantaged Latinos to reduce the disproportionate burden of negative consequences related to alcohol use compared to other racial/ethnic groups (NIAAA, 2013/2016). Cultural adaptation of evidence-based treatments, such as motivational interviewing (MI), can improve access and overall response to alcohol treatment. However, research progress has been hindered by the few theoretically-guided tests of adaptation and limited knowledge about the active ingredients and mechanisms of behavior change that might discriminate an adapted, compared to non-adapted, intervention. The proposed study will fill this important gap by testing a series of theory-driven hypotheses regarding the within-session predictors of MI outcome and a novel mechanism of culturally adapted MI (CAMI) (self-exploration → decreases in perceived acculturation stress, reduced depression and anxiety → reduced heavy drinking and consequences). The proposed study codes and examines within-session, process data from a parent RCT (AAR01021136, Lee: PI) guided by adaptation theory initially tested in a small RCT (AAK23021136, Lee: PI) that showed promising effects in favor of CAMI (Lee et al., 2013). The ongoing parent CAMI trial compared single session MI to single session CAMI delivered to Latino heavy drinkers (N=301, 18-65 yrs old). The parent study design (e.g., assessment of multiple self-report mediators) permits examination of a causal model, while attending to key recommendations on examining mechanisms of change (Kazdin & Nock, 2003). Up-to-date statistical approaches will be used to examine the MI causal hypothesis, such as investigating change and sustain talk together as a proportion estimate (Magill et al., 2014). The parent study design, which used an active comparator (MI), permits between-condition tests of within-session ingredients and mechanisms, which is a level of contrast rare in MI theory and one of the first a- priori investigations of processes of change in an adaptation study. The first task in adaptation is to confirm that key active treatment ingredients and mechanisms are preserved, so study aims are first, to assess MI ingredients and mechanisms among Latino adults, second, to examine novel MI ingredients and mechanisms potentially relevant to both conditions, and third, to test the theory, ingredients, and mechanisms specific to the adaptation. Long term objectives. Findings will improve dissemination of MI to Latinos by providing empirically-based guidelines on therapist training and on critical MI intervention ingredients. It will also improve understanding of the stress-health behavior link observed among health disparities populations and how MI can be used to disrupt this association. The proposed study will be one of the first to contribute to the emerging science on mechanisms of behavior change with health disparities populations and will yield important recommendations on the science of adaptation and ways to improve MI dissemination to community settings. Project Narrative Process research investigates how behavioral treatments work, thus findings can be used to optimize intervention efficacy and efficiency. In this process study we examine the within- session (motivational interviewing, MI) treatment predictors of behavior change in a health disparities population, socially-disadvantaged Latino heavy drinkers. The findings of this study, one of the first to examine mechanisms of MI cultural adaptation, will yield important recommendations on ways to improve MI dissemination to community settings serving Latino alcohol users as well as the science of adaptation more broadly.",Mechanisms of Behavior Change in a Cultural Adaptation of Motivational Interviewing,9694137,R01AA025485,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Client ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Empathy ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' social group process ', ' Group Processes ', ' Health behavior ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' extreme drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' drink heavily ', ' social ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active method ', ' active treatment ', ' active technique ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' active comparator ', ' pilot trial ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' trial comparing ', ' alcohol response ', ' response to ethanol ', ' response to alcohol ', ' ethanol response ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' causal model ', ' causal diagram ', ' improved outcome ', ' preservation ', ' ']",NIAAA,NORTHEASTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,459960,0.05715228624284024
"Biological determinants of colorectal cancer outcomes in Latinos of diverse ancestral origins ABSTRACT Hispanics/Latinos (Latinos) are the 2nd largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the United States. Although typically grouped as a single ethnic minority, Latinos are a heterogeneous population with diverse national origins, unique genetic admixture patterns (African, European, and Indigenous American ancestry), and a wide spectrum of socio-demographic characteristics. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common and fatal cancer among all Latinos combined; however, mortality rates differ substantially within Latino subpopulations defined, thus far, by place of birth. Rates are substantially higher in Puerto Ricans and Cubans, the subgroups with the highest African ancestry, than in Mexicans and non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). After accounting for socioeconomic status and access to care inequalities, differences in mortality persist, highlighting the need to accurately characterize and critically assess biological contributors to intra- and inter-ethnic group disparities. To overcome Latino underrepresentation in publicly available datasets, we propose to join resources from well- annotated epidemiologic studies including the Hispanic Colorectal Cancer Study (HCCS, R01CA155101), the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB, U54CA163068), and the Moffitt Cancer Center Total Cancer Care (TCC) cohort into a new consortium, the Latino Colorectal Cancer Consortium (LC3). This strategy allows us to maximize sample size and adequately represent the most common Latino subgroups in the US (i.e. Mexican, with high Indigenous American ancestry; Puerto Rican; and Cuban). We will characterize the somatic mutational profiles of Latino CRCs by whole exome sequencing using previously-collected tissues from the HCCS, PRBB, and TCC (n=600). For comparisons across racial/ethnic groups, we will leverage existing tumor sequencing data from NHW and African American (AA) CRCs in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO; 7,000 NHW), The Cancer Genome Atlas (283 NHW and 61 AA), and TCC (589 NHW and 40 AA). Here, we will examine driver mutation frequencies associated with estimated local and global genetic ancestry in Latino CRC cases (Aim 1), conduct a trans-ethnic analysis comparing frequencies of ancestry-associated and known clinically-actionable driver mutations in Latinos to NHW and AA (Aim 2), and assess the implications of genetic ancestry for survival as well as differential efficacy of conventional and potential targeted therapies for metastatic CRC using patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-based ex vivo live tissue sensitivity assays (LTSA) (Aim 3). Ancestry-specific PDX models will be established using fresh tissue from 40 prospectively recruited Latino, AA, and NHW TCC participants. Our innovative LTSA approach permits timely screening of multiple therapeutic agents while maintaining the tumor microenvironment and reliably predicting clinical responses. Results from this study will help us better understand the biological underpinnings of outcome disparities in Latino subgroups to inform translational efforts towards precision clinical applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project is focused on characterizing genetic features of colorectal cancer among major Latino subgroups in the United States (i.e. Mexican/Central American and Caribbean), who differ in ancestral backgrounds and colorectal cancer mortality rates. Our aims are to identify new cancer driver mutations present in Latinos with high indigenous American or African ancestry and to test their implications for treatment response and prognosis.

"2/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center Overall- Project Summary The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically, the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican- Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics, Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos. Project Narrative The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at an ISUPS (FAMU), and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The proposed two full projects and pilot project include investigators from the three institutions and will leverage on specimens collected across the partnership from Blacks and Latinos, representing a wide range of subpopulations within these minority groups. Thus, our studies will reveal unprecedented findings about these two understudied minority populations. Importantly, these projects will be instrumental in transferring cutting edge and innovative technologies to FAMU, will provide research training opportunities across the partnership to 100 students, post-doctoral fellows, and early stage investigators, and will expand in a significant way the research focus at UF and USC-NCCC to address cancer health disparities in prostate and pancreas cancer.","2/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center",9786714,U54CA233444,"['Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Methodology ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Central American ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Scientist ', ' South American ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' success ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Process ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' minority trainee ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' demographics ', ' health equity ', ' screening ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Student recruitment ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' minority scientist ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' translational cancer research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,U54,2019,1023148,0.10242261202746027
"The Effect of Pesticide Exposure on Cognitive and Brain Development in Latino Children: PACE5 Concern is mounting that commonly used pesticides are detrimental to children. Children are rapidly undergoing cognitive, sensory, and motor development, and disruption of normal maturation can have life-long consequences. The extant literature strongly indicates that prenatal exposure to pesticides leads to abnormal neurobehavioral development. A recent brain imaging study further showed that prenatal pesticide exposure is associated with disrupted anatomical brain development. However, results concerning the consequences of postnatal pesticide exposure are much less conclusive. Some studies have reported neurobehavioral deficits following postnatal pesticide exposure, but just as many studies have reported no negative consequences. Currently there are no studies that assess the effects of postnatal pesticide exposure on brain development using anatomical or functional brain imaging. More conclusive research on the effects of postnatal exposure on neurodevelopment requires a highly exposed population, a longitudinal design, and careful quantification of exposure and outcomes. We propose a two-group, prospective, longitudinal study of Latino children 7 years of age with quarterly measurement of cumulative pesticide exposure using passive dosimetry wristbands as well as documentation of prenatal and early life exposure through life history techniques. Children from Latino seasonal farmworker families will be compared with children from Latino families not participating in farm work and not living in an agricultural environment. Children in Latino farmworker families are at particularly high risk of exposure. Not only are pesticides frequently used in their low quality housing, but they are also exposed to agricultural pesticides used in nearby fields brought home by parental/sibling farmworkers on clothing. Children will be followed for 2 years with measurement of neurobehavioral function at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. Neuroimaging will be performed in a subset of participants with structural and functional brain organization assessed at baseline and two years later. Specific aims for this project are: Aim 1: Compare 2-year longitudinal and prenatal/early life pesticide exposure between children of Latino seasonal farmworkers and children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Aim 2: Compare 2-year longitudinal neurobehavioral and emotional and behavioral functioning among children of Latino seasonal farmworkers relative to children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Aim 3: Compare 2-year longitudinal anatomical and functional brain development between children of Latino seasonal farmworkers and children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Our nearly two decades of environmental justice (EJ) and community-based participatory research (CBPR) on pesticide exposure with farmworkers and their families provides an auspicious context to engage this vulnerable population in a study of both scientific and environmental justice importance.

"Linking Community and Family Characteristics to Adolescent Adjustment Latino youth in immigrant families are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. school population and face elevated risks of externalizing and internalizing problems and barriers to social and academic competence. Compromised adolescent adjustment harms youth and adult health and promotes inter-generational transmissions of inequality. Parenting processes are strong, malleable correlates of Latino youth adjustment. A glaring weakness in Latino parenting research is inadequate attention to extra-familial cultural demands and opportunities. These demands and opportunities include language use and co-ethnic concentration in neighborhoods; discrimination and support in school and peer contexts; Latino student concentration in schools; peer bullying victimization; and immigrant experiences tied to documentation status, discrimination, migration, and transnationalism. Gaps in research are pronounced for new immigrant destinations, where a lack of established co-ethnic enclaves and language barriers pose unique challenges for Latino families adjusting to life in the U.S. The main goal of this application is to specify the cascade of effects from extra-familial cultural demands and opportunities to Latino adolescent adjustment in an emerging immigrant area. Using culturally informed theory, multi-level data, and multiple mediator models, this research will test the hypothesis that Latino cultural inclusion and support in neighborhood, school, peer and immigrant contexts will lead to declines in youth's externalizing and internalizing problems and increases in youth's social and academic competence during adolescence. The study's mediating hypothesis is that Latino cultural inclusion and support external to the family will influence youth outcomes indirectly by reducing acculturation-related stress (immigrant stressors such as deportation fears, social isolation, and language barriers; parent-child acculturation gaps; demands on youth language brokering) and, in turn, increasing effective parenting (supportive parenting, parental monitoring, family cohesion, low conflict). Effective parenting is hypothesized to be associated reciprocally with adolescents' positive adjustment. Tests of moderated mediation will examine variations in pathways to youth outcomes by adolescents' gender, age, length of U.S. residence, and transition to high school. Using an intentionally missing data design, this study will have 8 time points of data spanning 6th to 11th grade for 600 Latino parent-youth dyads representative of Latinos in a suburban Atlanta school district. The PI's research and partnerships with the school district strengthen feasibility for the proposed study. Data will be analyzed using multilevel, structural equation modeling. In a key departure from individual- and family-level studies, this study will use an integrated theoretical model of culturally relevant extra-familial factors salient to acculturation stressors, parenting, and Latino adolescent adjustment. Results will identify the timing and targets of culture-specific policies and programs enhancing family interventions in new immigrant areas. As one-third of K-12 U.S. students will be Latino in less than a decade, results will inform efforts to reduce the public health burden of poor adjustment among the U.S. school population. Increases in the U.S. Latino population, rapid growth in new immigrant areas, and current policy debates around immigration underscore the timely need for this research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will assess how cultural demands and opportunities in neighborhood, school, peer and immigrant contexts influence acculturation-related stressors and, in turn, parenting processes and adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problems and social and academic competence. Study activities include the collection and analysis of eight time points of survey data over a period of four years for a school-based sample of adolescents (n = 600) and, for a random 50% of participating youth, their mothers (n = 300) in an emerging immigrant destination in suburban Atlanta. Findings will identify the timing and targets of culture-specific policies, programs, and community cultural supports that can enhance existing family-based interventions for Latino youth, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. school population.",Linking Community and Family Characteristics to Adolescent Adjustment,9709305,R01HD090232,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Attention ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Immigration ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Destinations ', ' Gender ', ' Competence ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' residence ', ' residential site ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Glare ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' bullying ', ' bully ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' intergenerational ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' eleventh grade ', ' high school junior ', ' 11th grade ', ' social ', ' parental monitoring ', ' parent monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' rapid growth ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' social exclusion ', ' marginalization ', ' school district ', ' K-12 student ', ' ']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,546268,0.0634971726675798
"Bridging the evidence-to-practice gap: Evaluating practice facilitation as a strategy to accelerate translation of a systems-level adherence intervention into safety net practices Project Summary: Despite increasing awareness and treatment of hypertension (HTN) across all racial/ethnic groups, Latinos have the lowest blood pressure (BP) control rates in the US (Latino adults: 34% vs. 43% and 53% in non-Hispanic black and white adults). These statistics may be explained by the disproportionately poorer adherence to antihypertensive medications among Latinos compared to blacks and whites. Systems- level interventions conducted in primary care settings have improved medication adherence in minority populations. Our Ayudando a Latinos Hipertensos Para Mejorar Adherencia a sus Medicamentos (ALMA) trial, which informs this proposal significantly improved both BP control (51 vs. 29%, p=.04) and medication adherence (78 vs. 72%, p=.02) compared to enhanced usual care in a sample of 119 Latino patients followed in a safety-net practice. Despite their efficacy, evidence-based interventions like ALMA often take up to 17 years to be translated into clinical practice. Implementation strategies are sorely needed to accelerate the translation of evidence-based interventions into routine “real world” safety-net practices, in order to reduce disparities in BP control in vulnerable populations. Practice facilitation (PF) is one method to accelerate the implementation of evidence-based interventions into healthcare settings. Through PF, a facilitator works with healthcare teams to develop the skills to adapt and implement evidence-based system changes and promotes a tailored approach to integrating those changes into the clinic workflow. Although evidence supports the effect of PF for preventive screenings (e.g., breast examination), its impact on implementing evidence-based systems approaches to support HTN management in safety-net practices remains largely untested. This proposal provides an opportunity to fill this evidence-to-practice gap by evaluating the effectiveness of PF as a practical and replicable strategy for implementing ALMA in a network of 12 safety-net Family Health Centers (FHCs) in New York City. Using a mixed-methods design, we will conduct this study in two phases: (1) A pre- implementation phase where we will refine the PF strategy, informed by our prior work, based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to facilitate the implementation of ALMA at the FHCs. (2) An implementation phase, during which we will evaluate, in a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial, the effect of the PF strategy compared to a self-directed condition (i.e., receipt of information for implementing ALMA but no facilitation) on implementation fidelity (primary outcome) of ALMA and on clinical outcomes (secondary outcome) at 12 months among a sample of 650 Latinos with uncontrolled HTN cared for at the FHCs. Implementation fidelity will be assessed using a mixed methods approach based on the five core dimensions of implementation fidelity, as defined by Proctor’s Implementation Outcomes Framework. Clinical outcome measures include BP control (defined as <140/90 mmHg) and medication adherence (assessed using the proportion of days covered via pharmacy records). Project Narrative: Latinos with hypertension (HTN) are twice as likely to have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) compared to whites, despite similar prevalence of HTN in both groups; poor adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications among Latinos may explain this racial gap. Despite a wealth of research dedicated to developing interventions to improve medication adherence in patients with uncontrolled HTN, the translation of these interventions into routine practice within “real world” safety-net primary care settings has been inadequate and slow. Identifying practical and replicable strategies that are effective for facilitating the translation of efficacious interventions into routine practice in safety-net settings are sorely needed to improve the poor rates of medication adherence and BP control among Latinos—thereby supporting the goals of the health care reform law to ensure the delivery of efficient and high quality health care services through coordinated, comprehensive and patient-centered care.",Bridging the evidence-to-practice gap: Evaluating practice facilitation as a strategy to accelerate translation of a systems-level adherence intervention into safety net practices,9688793,R01MD013769,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' skills ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Translation Process ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' systematic review ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Preventative screening ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' implementation research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' routine care ', ' routine practice ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' hypertension control ', ' hypertension management ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' formative assessment ', ' formative evaluation ', ' Self-Direction ', ' personalized approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient barriers ', ' implementation strategy ', ' breast exam ', ' breast examination ', ' health goals ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,738623,0.051315580919368435
"SALUD: Syndemic Alcohol Use Disorders, Violence, and HIV/STI in Young Latino Men Project Summary: Given the pervasive disparities in alcohol use disorders (AUD) and HIV among young Latino men, the proposed training plan will build upon my work on HIV transmission risk and co-morbidities by training me in: 1) alcohol and HIV epidemiology, 2) the integration of biological measures with behavioral science, and 3) longitudinal data analysis, while expanding the scope of my health disparities research to include Latino men. With the guidance of my exceptional Mentor Team, the proposed training aims will be achieved with a combination of in-/formal coursework and workshops in alcohol epidemiology, stress response biomarkers, and longitudinal statistical methods as well as practical experience in primary data collection, assay, and analysis, of salivary, urinary, and blood stress biomarkers with behavioral data in ethnic minority populations. In addition, this K01 will provide me with guidance to develop skills for a successful academic career and support for my transition into an independent investigator. Men make up 87% of new HIV infections among Latinos. Latino men play a central role in bridging HIV/STI across sexual networks due to their sexual risk behaviors (e.g., concurrent sex partners, unprotected anal sex, same-sex [MSM] activity). Furthermore, harmful alcohol use increases risk behavior and IPV perpetration, all factors associated with a substantially increased risk for HIV/STI. The syndemic co-occurrence of AUD, intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV/STI is theorized to take root in systemic socio-structural disadvantage, but the mechanisms causing this syndemic are not well understood, especially in Latino men. The Social Stress Theory suggests that social inequity elevates exposure and vulnerability to stress, limits access to coping resources, and increases AUD and HIV disparities. The proposed longitudinal, epidemiological study aims to elucidate the temporal sequence of AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI, as well as identify risk/protective social stress factors in Latino men (versus white men) during their critical transition from adolescence (12-18 years) to mid-adulthood (32-42 years). To achieve this, we propose secondary analysis of four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n=5,140), which contains rich social, behavioral, and biological data (e.g., stress response, HIV/STI biomarkers). Findings from this research will inform the development of more effective AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI prevention and treatment interventions for Latino men, and will highlight sub-group nuances among Latino men (e.g., by non-/white race, national sub-group, and sexual orientation). Classified as High Priority by the NIH Office of AIDS Research, this K01 will provide cross- cutting research training for a highly productive ethnic minority junior investigator to conduct HIV/AIDS Research to Reduce Latino Health Disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections and to understand the role of chronic inflammation and AUD in exacerbating these disparities. Project narrative: SALUD (Cheers/Health) aims to elucidate the temporal sequence of alcohol use disorders (AUD), intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV/STI, and to identify risk/protective socio- structural factors, and stress and coping factors among Latino men (versus white men; n=5,140) in their critical transition from adolescence (12-18 years) to mid-adulthood (32-42 years). Identifying socio-structural and stress and coping targets for intervention will inform the development of more effective AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI prevention and treatment interventions for Latino men. Furthermore, the proposed training in alcohol and HIV epidemiology, integration of biological measures with behavioral science, and longitudinal data analysis will provide cross- cutting research training for a productive ethnic minority junior investigator in areas classified as High Priority (by the NIH Office of AIDS Research), and position her as an independent investigator and leader in Latino disparities in alcohol and HIV.","SALUD: Syndemic Alcohol Use Disorders, Violence, and HIV/STI in Young Latino Men",9676188,K01AA025009,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Infectious Mononucleosis Virus ', ' HHV-4 ', ' Epstein-Barr Virus ', ' Epstein Barr Virus ', ' EBV ', ' EB virus ', ' E-B Virus ', ' Burkitt Lymphoma Virus ', ' Burkitt Herpesvirus ', ' Human Herpesvirus 4 ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Diabetes disparities in Latino subpopulations: linking biology to social epidemiology Abstract The overall goal for this application for an NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the candidate, Sandra Albrecht, PhD, MPH, with indispensable training and protected time to build an independent, transdisciplinary research program at the interface of the biomedical and socio-ecological domains to provide a more complete understanding of the factors underlying progression to and from type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Latino subpopulations. Responding to the staggering burden of T2D and poor glucose control in U.S. Latinos, to unanswered questions regarding variation in disease risk and burden within this broad population, and to the dearth of longitudinal studies in this area, the research aims are to 1) Characterize patterns of glucose dysregulation over time in non-diabetic Latino ethnic subgroups, and evaluate the role of social, environmental, and clinical factors in driving that variation; (2) Characterize patterns of T2D progression over time in diabetic Latino ethnic subgroups, and evaluate the role of social, environmental, and clinical factors in driving that variation; and (3) Characterize the effectiveness of a key social determinant – healthcare utilization - for successful T2D management within a specific Latino subpopulation, and evaluate how other social, environmental, and clinical factors modify that effectiveness. Data for Aims 1 and 2 will come from a large national longitudinal population-based study with oversamples of Latino subgroups: the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Data for Aim 3 will come from electronic health record data from a large healthcare system in North Carolina, a region with a fast growing Latino population. As part of this aim, Latino diabetic subjects will be recruited for a pilot study evaluating self-reported barriers to achieving control of glucose as part of a long-term effort to integrate social factors into the clinical management of T2D. To match the scope of the proposed scientific work, the candidate will seek to integrate her expertise in the social epidemiology of obesity and diabetes with the following career development and training areas: 1) training in the physiology of glucose dysregulation; 2) understanding of clinical issues relevant to T2D prevention and treatment; and 3) use of electronic health records data and health informatics. This training will be augmented with career-building activities to acquire essential tools for leadership and professional growth, as well as dissemination and translation of findings. Experts have emphasized the need for a more complete understanding of subgroup-specific T2D physiology and of subgroup-specific risk factors underlying progression to and from T2D. This K01 project will impact public health by improving characterization of T2D outcomes in Latino subpopulations to inform tailored prevention and treatment strategies. The project builds upon exceptional resources and mentoring at the candidate's institution (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), to train her in key new areas, bolster applications for competitive funding, disseminate findings among researchers and the wider community, augment faculty diversity, and attain research independence. Project Narrative This proposal addresses a central challenge in type 2 diabetes (T2D) research: prioritizing efforts to reduce disparities in U.S. Latinos. With this award, I will build an independent, transdisciplinary research program at the interface of the biomedical and socio-ecological domains to provide a more complete understanding of the factors underlying progression to and from T2D specific to Latinos. This research will inform translational approaches to reduce T2D burden taking into the account the enormous variability of the U.S. Latino population.",Diabetes disparities in Latino subpopulations:

"Tailoring of Childhood Obesity Screening and Counseling for Latino Families with Preschool-Aged Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application for a K23 award for a fellowship trained pediatrician specializing in Pediatric Nutrition and childhood obesity. The candidate is committed to an academic career as a physician scientist conducting patient-oriented research in childhood obesity. This award will support the candidate's training and attainment of expertise in three areas: qualitative research methods, cultural tailoring of technology-based interventions, and implementation science. This training will support his overall goals of designing and rigorously testing childhood obesity interventions that can be readily translated and disseminated and that will provide critical insight for care in diverse settings and patient groups. To achieve these goals, Dr. Haemer has assembled a cross-disciplinary mentoring team, each with outstanding experience in research methods and strong records of successful mentoring: Dr. Glasgow, a behavioral scientist who is renown within the field of implementation science; Dr. Bull, an expert researcher in technology-based health promotion; and Dr. Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition specialist with extensive research and clinical experience in childhood obesity and with a long history of mentoring young investigators. The proposed research addresses the huge knowledge gap in cost-effective ways for the healthcare system to influence both patient-level and population-level outcomes for childhood obesity. Evidence-based approaches of surveillance, screening, prevention and treatment largely remain uncertain or untested, especially for the youngest children from groups at highest risk of obesity-related health disparity. This K23 award will study methods for prevention and treatment applied to Latino preschool-aged children from low- income families. The research will test the central hypothesis that culturally tailored screening and counseling will be more effective at decreasing BMI trajectory than usual care. Specific aims include: 1. To characterize components of primary care interactions that should be culturally tailored to enhance motivation for healthy lifestyle change among Latino parents with preschoolers 2. To design a technology-user interface that maximizes acceptance by Latino parents of young children. 3. To pilot test a technology-supported screening and counseling protocol tailored to Latino parents using findings of Aims 1 and 2. Using an implementation science perspective, we will assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation fidelity, and sustainable maintenance of the intervention in clinical practice during the pilot RCT. This research and training will form the basis for an RO1 proposal to test technology-supported childhood obesity prevention and treatment interventions targeting young children from low-income Latino families. OMB No. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12 Approved Through 8/31/2015) Page Continuation Format Page PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    By studying how technology can support behavioral interventions for childhood obesity within primary care settings serving high-risk minority populations, we have the potential to deliver cost-effectiveness of obesity interventions with broad reach.

"Sleep Apnea Phenotypes in Latinos (SLEPT) Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a vascular risk factor that can lead to development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Importantly, OSA is highly prevalent in Latinos, who have more than a 2-fold risk of diabetes and CVD compared to non-Hispanic whites; disparities that motivated this R21 application. Treatment of OSA has not consistently reduced cardiovascular risk in clinical trials, results partly explained by suboptimal adherence to positive airway pressure therapy. Alternatively, identifying the subset of individuals who respond more favorably to OSA therapy can lead to personalized care and greater reduction in CVD. Of interest, OSA phenotypes have been described using data-driven analytical methods, such as cluster analysis, allowing evaluation of distinct groups of OSA patients at higher risk for CVD. Importantly, OSA phenotypes have not been described in Latinos, who have a large burden of diabetes and CVD. In addition, most studies are comprised of middle-aged males from clinical centers, which could introduce selection bias. Hence, there is a gap of prospective population based studies that can advance our understanding of OSA phenotypes and CVD risk, especially in a large and diverse sample of Latinos. Sleep apnea phenotypes in Latinos (SLEPT) evaluate OSA phenotypes in a large population-based cohort of U.S. Latinos. We efficiently leveraged the baseline and second- wave data of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL; N=16,415). SOL provides extensive and detailed data on sociocultural, genetic, and cardiovascular risk factors. At baseline (2008-2011), SOL obtained home-sleep test in over 16,000 participants and sleep habits through questionnaires and actigraphy, in a subsample of 2,252 SOL participants. In this exploratory study, we propose to analyze the sleep and cardiovascular measures obtained at SOL Visit 1 and new emerging data, obtained during follow-up in visit 2 (years 2014-2017). SLEPT will define the sleep phenotypes associated to early cardiovascular risk; provide preliminary data for polysomnography in future studies and identify at-risk individuals for sleep interventions and CVD outcomes in SOL. Therefore we aim to 1) identify OSA phenotypes across age, sex and Latino groups and 2) determine which phenotypes associates with prevalent and incident diabetes mellitus and CVD. By year 2060, 29% of the U.S. population will be Latino. However, there is no information about the OSA phenotypes that prospectively associate with CVD risk in Latinos. SLEPT will address the factors that explain within Latino differences in sleep, diabetes and CVD; in addition to Latino health disparities when compared to other U.S. demographic groups. This study is responsive to Healthy People 2020 goals and the NIH/NHLBI workshop on Personalized Medicine and Hispanic Health. Project Narrative We analyzed sleep apnea clinical phenotypes across age, gender and Latino groups that predict incident diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.

"Social disparities in physical functioning by race, ethnicity, and immigration status Project Summary / Abstract Although foreign-born Latinos have significantly higher life expectancy than non-Latino whites in the U.S., they are more likely to spend those additional years of life with a disability. Socioeconomic variations among race and ethnic groups cannot alone account for race/ethnic differences in disability. Previous research on the causes of these inequalities has primarily focused on explanations such as differential access to health care, early life conditions, environmental exposures, personal health behaviors, and stress. We investigate another potential mechanism: race and ethnic differences in work – i.e., the cumulative effects of physical and psychosocial conditions experienced as work throughout life. The US occupational structure is highly stratified by race/ethnicity and gender and extensive research on occupational health has demonstrated a strong relationship between physical and psychosocial work conditions and health outcomes. Our goal is to determine whether racial and ethnic differences in work conditions over the life course can account, in part, for significantly higher limitations in physical functioning among middle aged and older Latinos compared to whites. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and match employment histories from this survey with data on work conditions by occupational code for respondents' jobs from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The analysis is based on growth curve and hazard models of limitations in physical functioning and mortality as a function of histories of work conditions and other variables. Reduced physical functioning can significantly diminish quality of life at older ages and greatly increase health care expenditures. Functional limitations are more common among social groups, including Latinos and particularly Latino immigrants, who have the fewest resources to cope with these limitations. The results of this study will significantly advance our knowledge of the role occupational segregation and work conditions in leading to higher rates of functional limitations among the Latino population. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to determine whether working in more demanding and stressful environments during adulthood decreases functional health at older ages and can explain the differences observed in older adult functional limitations by race, ethnicity, and immigration status. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Employment histories from this survey will be matched with data on work conditions by occupational code for each job that respondents have held from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET).","Social disparities in physical functioning by race, ethnicity, and immigration status",9641910,R01AG061094,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Puericulture ', ' Child Care ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' health care expenditure ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Hazard Models ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Housework ', ' Housekeeping ', ' Immigration ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Information Networks ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Marmots ', ' Marmota ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' mortality ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' disability ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Physical Function ', ' Occupational ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' social group ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Documentation ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' health data ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Social stratification ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,376798,0.017483463526376742
"Apoyo Con Carino: Patient Navigation to Improve Palliative Care for Seriously Ill Latinos Project Summary Latinos are more likely to experience uncontrolled pain, institutional death, and are less likely to engage in advance care planning. Efforts to increase access to palliative care must maximize primary palliative care and community based models to meet the ever growing need in a culturally-sensitive and congruent manner. Patient navigator interventions are community based, culturally tailored models of care and have been successfully implemented to improve disease prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. We have developed and implemented a patient navigation intervention to improve palliative care outcomes for seriously ill hospitalized Latinos. We have demonstrated feasibility and early findings suggest this intervention can improve palliative care outcomes for Latinos with advanced cancer. Building on this prior research, we propose a fully powered randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of the manualized patient navigator intervention in a non-cancer population. A total of 240 Latino adults with non-cancer, advanced medical illness enrolled from 8 urban and 4 rural clinical sites will be randomized to the intervention group (5 palliative care-related patient navigator visits plus educational materials) or control group (usual care plus educational materials). Participants randomized to the intervention group will demonstrate better quality of life, will be more likely to have a palliative approach to their care, have higher rates of advance care planning, better pain and symptom control, and higher rates of hospice utilization compared to the control group). We will conduct a cost analysis of the patient navigator intervention by comparing direct costs of the intervention and cost and utilization of health care system resources across the study arms. Participants randomized to the intervention will have lower costs in the 6 months following study enrollment compared to participants in the control arm. Decedent participants randomized to the intervention will have lower costs in the last 3 months of life compared to decedent participants in the control arm. For the intervention visits, bicultural, bilingual navigators (guias) integrate core Latino values, while addressing barriers to a palliative approach through education, culturally tailored messaging, and patient activation. Patients will be interviewed at baseline and 3 months using the QUAL- E quality of life scale, Brief Pain Inventory, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, and the Patient Navigator Process and Outcomes Measure. Medical records will be reviewed to assess advance directive completion, hospice and health care utilization and intensity of care at the end of life. This culturally tailored, evidence-based, theory driven, highly innovative patient navigation intervention has significant potential to improve palliative care for Latinos, and facilitate true health equity in palliative and end of life care. PROJECT NARATIVE Palliative care is a priority area of focus for the National Institute of Nursing Research. Despite the evidence- based benefits of palliative care, access remains limited, especially in poor urban and rural settings. Cultural and linguistic barriers may also increase disparities in palliative care for Latinos. Due to a nationwide shortage of palliative care providers and the unique cultural preferences and values of patients, our innovative study has the potential to improve palliative care outcomes and reduce health disparities in both urban and rural underserved communities.",Apoyo Con Carino: Patient Navigation to Improve Palliative Care for Seriously Ill Latinos,9747358,R01NR016467,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost benefit effectiveness ', ' cost benefit economics ', ' Cost-Benefit Analysis ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Hospices ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' Medical Records ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Hospice Care ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Process Measure ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' care delivery ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' member ', ' cultural values ', ' Prevention ', ' end of life care ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' palliative ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' Symptoms ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Direct Costs ', ' Educational Materials ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Process ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' care systems ', ' care services ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' care preference ', ' clinical research site ', ' clinical site ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' tailored messaging ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' health equity ', ' arm ', ' two-arm study ', ' screening ', ' improved outcome ', ' navigator intervention ', ' pain symptom ', ' painful symptom ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' rural underserved ', ' urban underserved ', ' urban setting ', ' rural setting ', ' rural place ', ' rural locality ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' intervention cost ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' treatment arm ', ' intervention arm ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R01,2019,547233,0.03510580889744316
"Online course to prepare promotores to support low-income Latino parents of children with special healthcare needs KDH Research & Communication (KDHRC) submits this Fast Track SBIR proposal to develop, implement, and rigorously evaluate a culturally competent, online professional development course to prepare promotores to support low-income Latino parents of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) as they navigate the education and health care systems. CSHCN experience poorer health, psychosocial, and academic outcomes than the general child population exhibited by frequent school absences, behavioral problems, grade repetition, and lack of school engagement. Compared to other CSHCN, Latino CSHCN are more likely to experience health and educational disparities including a lack of adequate health care insurance, specialist referrals, and consistent, affordable health care. Latino parents of CSHCN frequently experience difficulties while navigating the education and health care systems. Low-income Latino parents, especially first-generation immigrants, face linguistic and cultural barriers when seeking necessary medical services and educational accommodations for their CSHCN. Promotores, recognized as key health care workers in underserved communities, are ideally positioned to support Latino parents of CSHCN. Puentes will have a broad reach, be cost-effective, appropriate for promotores and their community-based organization (CBO) employers, as well as meet experts’ calls for programs addressing the need for culturally appropriate interventions to support this vulnerable population.  Puentes-trained promotores will empower Latino parents with health care and school system navigation skills to benefit their CSHCN. Puentes will contain a six-module online course, which will use text, video clips, and virtual client interactive training. Puentes-trained promotores will build parents’ knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and skills to request educational accommodations, interface with the child’s medical team, meaningfully participate in their child’s educational and medical care teams, coordinate health care and school services, and work with the school to resolve any challenges related to their child’s accommodations. The content and evaluation of Puentes will be driven by the theory of planned behavior, which has extensive empirical support and widespread applicability in health promotion interventions. In Phase I, we will create a program architecture plan comprised of a course outline, video storyboards, and virtual client details as well as a prototype of two full course modules. We will evaluate the modules in a two- stage feasibility evaluation study. In Phase II, we will use the architecture plan and feasibility study findings to finalize program videos, courses, resources, and dissemination website. A group-randomized controlled trial will explore the efficacy of Puentes when implemented in Latino-serving CBOs. Our market research suggests a significant need and eager market, and support from more than 39 organizations representing over 6,000 promotores substantiates Puentes’ programmatic importance and commercial potential. Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) encounter obstacles such as school absences, lack of school engagement, and grade repetition that can lead to poor lifelong academic, health, and social outcomes. Latino parents of CSHCN frequently experience linguistic and cultural barriers while navigating the education and health care systems, compounding the disparities their children experience. Puentes will be a culturally competent, online professional development course to prepare promotores to support Latino parents to navigate the health care and educational systems.

"3/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center Overall- Project Summary The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically, the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican- Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics, Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos. Project Narrative The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at an ISUPS (FAMU), and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The proposed two full projects and pilot project include investigators from the three institutions and will leverage on specimens collected across the partnership from Blacks and Latinos, representing a wide range of subpopulations within these minority groups. Thus, our studies will reveal unprecedented findings about these two understudied minority populations. Importantly, these projects will be instrumental in transferring cutting edge and innovative technologies to FAMU, will provide research training opportunities across the partnership to 100 students, post-doctoral fellows, and early stage investigators, and will expand in a significant way the research focus at UF and USC-NCCC to address cancer health disparities in prostate and pancreas cancer.","3/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center",9788326,U54CA233465,"['Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Methodology ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Central American ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Scientist ', ' South American ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' success ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Process ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' minority trainee ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' demographics ', ' health equity ', ' screening ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Student recruitment ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' minority scientist ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' translational cancer research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U54,2019,1224950,0.10242261202746027

"Reducing Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use Among Latino Immigrant Youth: A Preliminary Test of the ¡Unidos Se Puede! Program Reducing Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use Among Latino Immigrant Youth: A Preliminary Test of the  ¡Unidos Se Puede! Program ABSTRACT Adolescent alcohol, tobacco, and other drug (ATOD) use is a major public health concern, with rates for Latino middle school youth higher than other ethnic groups. One well-established precursor of adolescent ATOD use is psychosocial stress. Among Latino immigrant youth, stress related to migration is associated with ATOD use, depressive symptoms, and anti-social behavior, even after accounting for indicators of socio-economic status. Although several programs have been developed to address Latino ATOD use, they rely on bilingual professionals with a master's degree or higher to field the program. Latino families are increasingly locating themselves in new settlement areas that lack bilingual ATOD counselors equipped to provide appropriate prevention or treatment. This suggests that health disparities will widen without novel and effective ATOD use interventions targeting young Latino adolescents. Unidos is a positive youth development program that works with Latino parents and their adolescent children to delay or reduce ATOD use by increasing parental involvement in their child's schooling and youth academic achievement. Because Unidos can be delivered by community-based ""promotoras"" rather than masters level clinicians, it addresses the implementation, scalability and sustainability problems associated with existing ATOD prevention programs. Initial evaluations of Unidos' impact on strengthening Latino adolescents' ability to succeed are positive, but its impact on reducing ATOD use has not been evaluated. The proposed project examines the preliminary efficacy of Unidos to decrease ATOD use among Latino youth in new settlement areas. The goals of this efficacy trial will be achieved by accomplishing two specific aims: (1) Evaluate the potential of the intervention to delay the initiation into or reduce ATOD use among Latino youth who are 1st to 2nd generation immigrants; and (2) Evaluate the intervention’s ability to strengthen known protective factors against ATOD use among adolescents–specifically child personal agency and parent-child, peer, and school relationships. To accomplish these aims, we propose an attention placebo randomized control trial. For this trial, we will recruit a sample of youth and their parents (N=120 dyads) from a random sample of Latino 7th graders in Tulsa Public Schools. Those meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and agreeing to participate will provide baseline data before being randomly assigned to either the treatment or control condition (n=60 dyads each). Participants will be followed for 32 months post-baseline, during which time we will collect psychosocial measures annually near the end of each of three school years (7th, 8th, and 9th grades). The two primary hypotheses that will be tested are: (1) Youth in the Unidos program will delay initiation of ATOD use compared to youth in a control group; and (2) Youth in the Unidos program will have less ATOD use compared to youth in a control group. Public Health Implications: This project has important public health implications. If effective, the study will provide preliminary evidence of a psychosocial intervention that reduces ATOD use among an understudied immigrant population and holds potential to address the implementation, scalability and sustainability problems associated with existing ATOD prevention programs targeting Latino immigrant youth in new settlement areas.","Reducing Alcohol, Tobacco, and Drug Use Among Latino Immigrant Youth: A Preliminary Test of the ¡Unidos Se Puede!

"Adaptation and Pilot Feasibility of a Psychotherapy Intervention for Latinos with Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Latinos are at higher risk of poorer psychological and quality of life outcomes when compared to non-Hispanic white patients and other minority patients and commonly report using spiritual strategies to cope with cancer. Maintaining hope, spiritual well-being and finding meaning in the cancer experience is critical for the adjustment and well-being of advanced cancer patients. However, there are no targeted psychosocial or psychotherapeutic interventions available for Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer. Meaning-Centered psychotherapy (MCP) is a novel psychotherapeutic intervention designed to help patients with advanced cancer sustain or enhance a sense of meaning, peace and purpose as they approach the end-of-life. The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and pilot Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy with Spanish-speaking Latinos (MCP-L) diagnosed with advanced cancer. The first aim of this study is to translate and culturally adapt the Meaning Centered Psychotherapy intervention manual guided by the Ecological Validity Framework, based on our previous formative research and with information gathered by interviewing 15 key informants and a pre- pilot of key sections of MCP-L with 10 Spanish-speaking Latinos patients. The second aim is to determine its feasibility and acceptability, and to generate preliminary data on impact (improvement of spiritual well-being, quality of life and reduction of depression, anxiety, and hopelessness) of the culturally adapted version of MCP- L by conducting a randomized controlled pilot trial. My long-term goal is to become an independent clinical researcher and an expert in the cultural adaptation field of psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions with minority cancer patients. This application will allow me to acquire the training and mentored research experience and obtain additional training in: (1) Transcreation and cultural adaptation of interventions; (2) Psychotherapy theory research and process research, (3) Mixed methods approaches, (4) Design, implementation and evaluation of randomized controlled trials with Latino patients, and (5) Dissemination and implementation science. I am proposing a mix of guided mentoring, didactic training, coursework, webinars, seminars and tutorials, directed readings, conferences, and hands-on research activities that will facilitate the development of research skills and enable me to gain experience in these areas. This proposal is responsive to the priorities of the NCI Strategic Plan, to study and identify factors contributing to disparities, develop culturally appropriate approaches, and disseminate interventions to overcome health disparities across the cancer control continuum from disease prevention to end-of-life care. The research agenda will allow me to acquire the research skills to become a successful independent investigator in the important field of cultural adaptation of psychosocial interventions for ethnic minority cancer patients. The study findings will be used to submit a competitive NIH R01 application to conduct a large randomized controlled trial of Meaning Centered Psychotherapy with Spanish-speaking patients diagnosed with advanced cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because it addresses the critical lack of palliative cancer care interventions for the Spanish-speaking population. NCI recognizes that minorities and other underserved populations bear a far greater cancer burden than the general population. NCI aims to overcome cancer disparities by promoting research to understand the underlying causes and contributing factors of cancer treatment and survival disparities, and by accelerating the dissemination and implementation of interventions to address cancer health disparities. Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer are at risk for poor mental health outcomes.

"Exploring cancer prevention and screening message engagement on Facebook among U.S. Latinos PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer is the leading cause of death among Latinos in the U.S. The cancers with the highest estimated incidence rates among Latinos in 2015 were breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers – all screenable cancers linked to preventable behaviors. Latinos are also more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stages of disease compared to non-Hispanic Whites; this has been associated with lower screening rates. Given this unequal burden of disease, it is important to identify ways to effectively reach and educate Latinos on how cancer prevention and screening can reduce these cancer health disparities. Social media presents an innovative platform to engage with Latinos dialogically by allowing user interaction through posts, pictures, videos and other information sharing. Due to its popularity, Facebook may be a useful platform for Latinos without a history of cancer to engage with cancer prevention and screening messages. This is particularly important among Latinos age 40-75, as they are eligible for breast, prostate and/or colorectal cancer screenings. The proposed mixed methods study will explore engagement with cancer messaging on Facebook among U.S. Latinos. Specific aims include: (1) examining engagement with cancer posts on the top national health Facebook Pages tailored to Latinos; (2) exploring how and why Latino adults age 40-75 without a history of cancer engage with cancer prevention and screening messages on Facebook; and (3) understanding how Latino adults age 40-75 without a history of cancer assess the credibility and accuracy of cancer messages they engage with on Facebook. Aim 1 will assess how Facebook users engaged with relevant cancer prevention and screening posts on NCI and CDC's Spanish-language Facebook Pages. Post likes, comments and/or shares between 2015 and 2017 will be analyzed via content analysis and logistic regressions. Aims 2 and 3 will be conducted concurrently during one-on-one, in-person encounters where the participant will access his/her Facebook profile, and scroll-through and discuss engagement with cancer-related posts with the researcher. Participants (n=30) will be recruited through stratified purposeful sampling, equally stratified by language preference and gender. Participants must self-identify as Latino/Hispanic; be 40-75 years old; have a Facebook account they use at least 3x a week; have no previous cancer diagnosis; and have a family member or close friend that is a cancer survivor. After completing a short demographics survey, participants will access their Facebook account alongside the researcher and walk-through the past six months of cancer messages posted on their Facebook NewsFeed. Participant engagement with content will prompt semi-structured, in-depth interviews discussing engagement with cancer messages. Data will be analyzed via content analysis and thematic analysis. Analyses for all three aims will be integrated to develop a final conceptual model. Findings will provide insight to specific attributes in cancer messages that attract user engagement and subsequent action, as well as how Latinos assess the credibility and accuracy of this information. PROJECT NARRATIVE A thorough understanding of how Latinos engage with cancer messages on Facebook can inform better educational efforts on social media platforms in general, providing insight to user engagement with posted information; triggers to sharing information with other Latino users; and differences in utilization by gender and language preferences. These findings may assist in developing better ways to expose Latinos to online messages that promote cancer prevention behaviors, as well as tailoring cancer education interventions using social media to improve cancer screening rates. They also contribute to the limited body of literature on the utilization of social networking sites (like Facebook) as a vehicle to reducing cancer health disparities among Latino populations in the U.S.",Exploring cancer prevention and screening message engagement on Facebook among U.S. Latinos,9834676,F31CA224615,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cause of Death ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Demographic Survey ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Walking ', ' Family member ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Area ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' detect colorectal cancer ', ' detect colo-rectal cancer ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colorectal cancer detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' colo-rectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer detection ', ' CRC screening ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' preference ', ' empowered ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Media Campaign ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer diagnosis ', ' Data ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' survive cancer ', ' Communication Tools ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' social networking website ', ' web-based social networking ', ' social networking web site ', ' social networking site ', ' online social networking ', ' on-line social networking ', ' screening ', ' Breast Cancer survivorship ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' Facebook ', ' Twitter ', ' ']",NCI,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2019,45016,0.14251695893239907
"Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community members Recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, including skin and respiratory irritation and asthma, as well as potential reproductive effects and breast cancer. Nonetheless, the production and distribution of these products continues to expand. In response public health actions have aimed to reduce exposures through substituting use of environmentally safer products in public buildings and schools and encouraging development of certified environmentally safer product labels. While these initiatives have been successful at reaching certain groups of workers and consumers, low wage domestic and other cleaning workers, who are disproportionately immigrant and Latino, have been largely left out due to factors including knowledge, awareness, cost and accessibility. The Safe and Just Cleaners Project aims to address this environmental health disparity by documenting and reducing exposures to cleaning agents among domestic cleaning workers in the Latino immigrant worker community in NYC, as part of a University- Community partnership. The rationale for this project is that once domestic cleaners, as part of a large and influential community-based organization, gain capacity and knowledge to recognize their exposures and potential risks as workers, this will lay the basis for building a joint worker-community effort that will simultaneously a) improve conditions for themselves as cleaning workers, and b) reduce exposure to hazardous cleaning agents in the larger community of which the workers are a part. Working collaboratively with the largest Latino immigrant community-based organization in NYC, with 30,000 members, the project will survey Latino domestic workers about their use, work practices, values, knowledge and attitudes about potential hazards and self-reported health problems associated with consumer cleaning product use. The project will then identify and quantitatively evaluate the exposure levels and conditions that result in inhalation and dermal exposures to volatile organic and quaternary ammonium compounds, two major and potentially toxic components of commercial cleaning agents, among Latino immigrant domestic cleaning workers. The project will measure exposures both at the time of cleaning as well as residual exposures that might continue to contaminate home environments even after cleaning tasks are complete. These findings will be used to develop and implement a multilevel strategic campaign to reduce exposures among immigrant communities through local and national partnerships. Embedding this campaign within a workers’ rights and social justice perspective provides an approach that educates people about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures. Although recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, important populations of users of the agents - low wage domestic cleaning workers who are mainly immigrant and Latino - have inadequate knowledge and limited access to safer alternatives, whether using these products at work or at home. The Safe and Just Cleaners/Limpieza Sana y Justa Project will document exposures to cleaning agents among the Latino immigrant domestic cleaners in NYC. Using a workers’ rights and social justice perspective, the project’s public health campaign will inform Latino domestic cleaners and their communities about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures.",Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community members,9854116,R01ES027890,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Ammonia ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' Community Workers ', ' Disinfectants ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Industrialization ', ' Influentials ', ' Irritants ', ' Joints ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Language ', ' New York ', ' Privatization ', ' Product Labeling ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' Social Justice ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' skin irritation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Dermal ', ' Policies ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' irritation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' respiratory ', ' Inhalation Exposure ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' quaternary ammonium compound ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Allergic ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' reproductive ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' dermal exposure ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' community partnership ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIEHS,QUEENS COLLEGE,R01,2019,126922,0.03774989348207236
"1/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center Overall- Project Summary The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically, the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican- Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics, Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos. Project Narrative The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at an ISUPS (FAMU), and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The proposed two full projects and pilot project include investigators from the three institutions and will leverage on specimens collected across the partnership from Blacks and Latinos, representing a wide range of subpopulations within these minority groups. Thus, our studies will reveal unprecedented findings about these two understudied minority populations. Importantly, these projects will be instrumental in transferring cutting edge and innovative technologies to FAMU, will provide research training opportunities across the partnership to 100 students, post-doctoral fellows, and early stage investigators, and will expand in a significant way the research focus at UF and USC-NCCC to address cancer health disparities in prostate and pancreas cancer.","1/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center",9788328,U54CA233396,"['Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Methodology ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Central American ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' tool ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Scientist ', ' South American ', ' Location ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' success ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer care ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Process ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' minority trainee ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' demographics ', ' health equity ', ' screening ', ' genetic makeup ', ' genetic make-up ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Student recruitment ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' minority scientist ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' translational cancer research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,FLORIDA AGRICULTURAL AND MECHANICAL UNIV,U54,2019,977974,0.10242261202746027

"Preventing Diabetes in Latino Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and related health disparities represent some of the most significant public health challenges facing society. In particular, obese Latino adolescents are disproportionately impacted by insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is an intermediate stage in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and represents a critical opportunity for intervention. The Diabetes Prevention Program established that lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes. To date, no diabetes prevention studies have been conducted in obese Latino youth with prediabetes, a highly vulnerable and underserved group. Therefore, we propose a randomized-controlled trial to test the short-term (6-month) and long-term (12-month) efficacy of a culturally-grounded, lifestyle intervention, as compared to usual care, for improving glucose tolerance and reducing diabetes risk in 120 obese Latino adolescents with prediabetes. We will further test intervention effects on quality of life, explore the potential mediating effects of changes in total, regional, nd organ fat on improving glucose tolerance and increasing insulin sensitivity, and estimate the initial incremental cost- effectiveness of the intervention as compared with usual care for improving glucose tolerance. The overall approach is framed within a multilevel Ecodevelopmental model that leverages community, family, peer, and individual factors during the critical transition period of adolescence when changes in health behaviors and health outcomes are linked to future health trajectories. The intervention is guided by Social Cognitive Theory and employs key behavioral modification strategies to enhance self-efficacy and foster social support for making and sustaining healthy behavior changes. The application builds upon extant collaborations of a transdisciplinary team of investigators working in concert with local community agencies to address critical gaps in how diabetes prevention interventions for obese Latino youth are developed, implemented and evaluated. This innovative approach is an essential step in the development of scalable, cost-effective, solution- oriented programs to prevent type 2 diabetes in this and other populations of high-risk youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are critical public health issues in youth. This study will test the effects and estimate the cost-effectiveness of a culturally-grounded community-based lifestyle intervention on type 2 diabetes risk among obese Latino adolescents with

"Linking state policies to Latino and Asian American immigrant health care access Project Summary/Abstract While many immigrants arrive in the US with good health status, there are persistent disparities in access to health care for immigrant groups that may contribute to their more than expected health declines over time, particularly among the nation's two largest immigrant populations, Latinos and Asians. Since the late 1990s there has also been a proliferation of public policies at the state level that have an impact on immigrant populations. There is growing evidence that immigrant policies are a structural factor associated with disparities in Latino and Asian immigrant health care access. Yet, there is limited understanding of the processes by which policy, a contextual factor, has an impact on individual-level health care access outcomes. This study aims to examine the pathways between state policy and access to care by (1) identifying and assessing the variation among Latino and Asian immigrants' experiences of exclusion related to immigrant policies, (2) understanding the extent to which experiences of policy-related exclusion are associated with barriers to health care, and (3) assessing the extent to which those associations are modified by citizenship status, race/ethnicity, and knowledge of policies. We will conduct a mixed-methods study of the experiences of exclusion among Latino and Asian immigrants in California, a demographically diverse state with a range of state-level immigrant policies. We will assess the association between access to health care and experiences of exclusion across five sectors: health care, social services, education, employment, and law enforcement. We will analyze data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a representative population survey of state residents, combined with a follow-up survey of 2,000 CHIS immigrant respondents that collects additional information on experiences related to immigrant policies. We will also conduct semi-structured interviews of immigrants in two regions to identify the nuances of their experiences of and responses to those policies. The findings from this research can both identify policies outside the health sector that have impacts on immigrant access to health care, and suggest educational interventions which could improve immigrant knowledge in ways that improves their access to needed health care. Project narrative This study will contribute to knowledge regarding the impact of public policies on access to health care by examining the experiences of Latino and Asian immigrants. It will build from research on the social determinants of health to understand the pathways between contextual social factors and individual-level health access outcomes.",Linking state policies to Latino and Asian American immigrant health care access,9692015,R01MD012292,"['Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Employment ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' treatment access ', ' service availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Public Policy ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Exclusion ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' Latin American ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' barrier to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' obstacle to care ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2019,609343,0.06449381085326938
"Enhanced Primary Care Nutrition and Screen time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Primary Care Based Feeding and Screen Time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants Latino children experience higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic white children, a disparity that emerges in infancy. Among Latino children, those with Spanish-speaking parents are at highest risk for obesity. Research has shown that optimal feeding strategies in early life and avoidance of screen time may lower the risk of childhood obesity, which in turn, reduces the risk of obesity and its comorbidities through    adulthood. However, few interventions have sought to promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino parents. In addition, most interventions in the literature that address infant obesity prevention have been conducted through home visits or special trips to the intervention site by parents, approaches that may not be sustainable in low-resource settings due to cost and the burden on participants. Given that infants are expected to have 7 well-child visits in the first year of life, primary care is an ideal setting in which to ofer parental education on infant feeding and screen time recommendations. The overall objective of this proposal is to design, pilot test, and refine a Spanish-language, culturally appropriate, primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in Latino infants born to Spanish-speaking    mothers. Our overarching hypothesis is that focused education on infant feeding and screen time avoidance will lead to use of optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers and result in less weight gain in the first year of life. In preparation for submitting an R01 application to test this hypothesis, we propose research with the following specific aims to be conducted at the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) outpatient pediatric clinic: Aim 1: Use the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to design 5 group educational modules that promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers; Aim 2: Use a pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to test a yearlong intervention in which the 5 modules (Aim 1) are provided to Spanish-speaking Latino mothers just after well-child visits at ages 2 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, and 12 months (primary outcomes will include use of responsive feeding practices, infant dietary intake, and infant active and passive television viewing time; secondary outcomes will be infant anthropometrics); Aim 3: Use qualitative methods to assess how individual components of the intervention from Aim 2 affected feeding and screen time practices. By the conclusion of    this award, we will have a scalable and potentially reproducible intervention for infant feeding and screen time practices, one that is linguistically and culturally appropriate for Spanish-speaking Latino parents and aims to reduce weight gain in the first year of life while promoting habits that protect against obesity across the lifespan. Dr. Amy Beck, PI for this mentored career development award, is a bilingual pediatrician with considerable clinical experience caring for low-income Latino children and a deep commitment to improving health outcomes    in this population. Dr. Beck is a pediatric attending at SFGH (a public hospital affiliated with UCSF that serves a majority Latino population) where she provides both general pediatric care and also is the co-director of the pediatric obesity clinic. With respect to her research background, Dr. Beck holds a MPH and completed a General Pediatrics research fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). During her fellowship, Dr. Beck used both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate risk factors for obesity among Latino children. She has 5 first-author publications, of which 4 directly inform this proposal. She is currently conducting two pilot intervention studies in obesity prevention and treatment for Latino children. Her long-term career goal is to be an independent investigator in the field of obesity prevention with a focus on improving preventive services for low-income Latino children. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Beck must strengthen her skills in biostatistics and qualitative methods and acquire new skills in dietary analysis and RCTs of behavioral interventions. Dr. Beck has formed an    interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors and consultants with expertise in general pediatrics, nutrition, psychology, anthropology, Latino health, pediatric obesity, and health policy. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Cabana, is an internationally respected health services researcher and the Division Chief of General Pediatrics at UCSF. Dr. Cabana has extensive expertise in the design and conduct of RCTs in the ambulatory setting and a strong track record of mentorship. In addition to her mentored research plan and ongoing tutorials with her    diverse mentorship team, Dr. Beck will take advantage of UCSF's numerous opportunities for research training. She will enroll in additional courses offered through the Training in Clinical Research Program that cover specific areas of her career development plan. She will also take a course at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health on dietary assessment. Finally, she will attend seminars offered by the Division of General Pediatrics and participate in the K scholars program offered by the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at UCSF. Dr. Beck has the full support of the UCSF Department of Pediatrics and the Division of General Pediatrics for this proposed award. By the conclusion of this award, Dr. Beck will be well positioned as an    independent investigator in the field of childhood obesity prevention research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the proposed research are to design and evaluate a low-cost, primary care-based intervention to prevent the onset of obesity in Latino infants. This proposal is relevant to public health because obesity often begins early in life and is associated with diabetes, heart disease, and numerous other comorbidities, and because Latino children in the United States experience disproportionately high rates of obesity. The goal of the proposed intervention is to promote infant feeding, nutrition and screen time practices that will be protective against obesity across the lifespan.",Enhanced Primary Care Nutrition

"ADAPTING AND ASSESSING THE FEASIBILITY OF ‘HEALTHY DADS, HEALTHY KIDS’ FOR US LATINOS Project Summary Latinos in the United States face health disparities for obesity and related medical conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Targeting families to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors has been identified as an effective strategy to prevent obesity. With the importance of familism (family cohesion) among Latino population, a family based intervention is especially desirable as an engaging strategy to promote behaviors that support a healthy weight status and decrease obesity related health disparities for Latinos. Emerging evidence supports the need to include and target fathers in family based lifestyle behavior interventions. However, to date primarily mothers have been reached by such efforts in the US. Health Dads Healthy Kids (HDHK) is an evidence based program developed in Australia, shown to have significant weight and behavior treatment effects for fathers and their children, compared to controls. The HDHK program is based on Social Cognitive Theory and Family Systems Theory and aims to promote increased physical activity and improved dietary intake. An important innovation in the program is that fathers and children attend together and are both targeted as agents of behavior change for each other (reciprocal reinforcement) and to participate in fun, family activities together. HDHK has several features that may appeal to Latino families: it is delivered in group sessions by a trained facilitator from the community (collectivism), and it promotes paternal role- modeling (enforces respeto), family cohesion, and engagement together in lifestyle behaviors (familism). How- ever, HDHK should be systematically culturally adapted for Latino families to ensure appropriate enrollment, engagement and promotion of desired health outcomes for Latino families, prior to further evaluation. We propose to convene a panel of Latino fathers and mothers from the community to serve as key informants; and an expert panel of researchers with experience in culturally adapting parenting interventions for Latinos, Latino lifestyle behaviors, and the influence of Latino fathers. The two panels will work with the study team (including the developer of HDHK) to systematically modify the HDHK program to culturally adapt it for Latino families following the Ecological Validity Model. They will also inform the selection of items from established item banks of food and physical activity parenting. The resulting scales will be tested among a sample of Latino fathers to establish validated scales of parenting for Latino fathers, which is expected to be a mediator of children's behavior change in HDHK, and will be needed in the future trial. The resulting Latino-HDHK will be tested for feasibility (as measured by retention, engagement, and satisfaction), in a pilot randomized controlled trial (n=40). The pilot study will include a thorough process evaluation, including exit interviews with participating Latino fathers and their co-parent (typically mothers). Once completed, this developmental study will position us to apply for a future R01 to assess the Latino-HDHK in a fully powered randomized controlled trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latino adults and children experience health disparities for overweight and obesity-related medical conditions, and therefore family level obesity prevention programs for Latino populations are urgently needed. `Health Dads Healthy Kids' is the first program to primarily target fathers for obesity prevention for themselves and their children, with significant and clinically relevant treatment effects. We propose to systematically culturally adapt `Healthy Dads Healthy Kids' for Latino families and test the feasibility of the program among a community sample of Latino families.","ADAPTING AND

"Fit 5 Kids Screen Time Reduction Curriculum for Latino Preschoolers: A RCT ABSTRACT  Screen time is a major risk factor for childhood obesity and inadequate physical activity, both of which are determinants of type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, and multiple cancers. Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority in the US. Because US Latino children have more screen time and higher rates of obesity than their non-Latino White peers, interventions to reduce screen time adapted for Latino preschoolers are necessary to reduce health inequities related to obesity and T2D in the US. However, a systematic review reported no successful screen time reduction interventions among Latino preschoolers.  Our team's pilot study tested the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids screen time reduction curriculum among Latino preschoolers in Head Start. This short term cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the only successful screen time reduction program for Latino preschoolers, having significantly reduced screen time by over 25 minutes/day. Our culturally adapted, multi-level intervention consists of lessons taught by study staff directly to preschoolers during Head Start, a weekly parent newsletter, child-tailored goal setting with parents, a lending library (books, games, arts/crafts, etc.) and parenting tips via text messages several times/week. We will use a social ecological model and consider multiple levels of influences for analyses: (1) individual-level influences, e.g., acculturation and social cognitive theory, (2) families, e.g., screen time parenting practices, (3) schools, and (4) macro-environmental influences, e.g., neighborhood disorder. Building on this pilot work, we propose a long term, efficacy, cluster RCT of the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids among Latino preschoolers in Head Start from three US settings: Seattle, Houston, and the rural Central Valley of Washington State. Among 280 Latino 3-5 year olds at 20 Head Start centers, our Specific Aims (SA) and Hypotheses (H) include: SA1) To conduct a cluster RCT of the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids curriculum to evaluate its efficacy in reducing screen time and excessive weight gain over a school year (8-months)  H1) Fit 5 Kids will decrease children's screen time (primary outcome), BMI z-scores and dietary energy intake, and increase MVPA compared to controls SA2) To examine mediators and moderators associated with reducing Latino preschoolers' screen time  H2) Parents' outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and screen time parenting practices will mediate the relationship between Fit 5 Kids and changes to preschoolers' screen time  H3) Parents' depressive symptoms, stress, and social support will moderate changes to child screen time  The proposed Fit 5 Kids cluster RCT will confirm the pilot's promising results, and the larger sample will allow for mediation analyses to better understand mechanisms. This research will provide justification for a future community effectiveness trial with implementation by Head Start teachers, and the eventual widespread dissemination of Fit 5 Kids in Head Start centers nationally. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood obesity and metabolic risk are at record high levels in the US, and Latino children are at very high risk. This project will test an intervention called Fit 5 Kids, designed for Latino preschoolers to decrease their screen time in order to promote physical activity and healthy eating, and to prevent obesity. Ultimately, this line of research has the potential to provide an effective program to reduce risk of obesity for Latinos in the Head Start program and other preschool-based settings.",Fit 5 Kids Screen Time Reduction Curriculum for Latino Preschoolers: A RCT,9634917,R01DK113005,"['Academy ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Books ', ' Energy Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Libraries ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Newsletter ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' preschool ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' pre-k ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' teacher ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Sample Size ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Metabolic ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Head Start ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' dietary excess ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' lifetime risk ', ' life-time risk ', ' systematic review ', ' obesity in children ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' child adiposity ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity prevention ', ' tv watching ', ' television watching ', ' screen time ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 5 year old ', ' five years of age ', ' five year old ', ' age 5 years ', ' 5 years of age ', ' obesity risk ', ' risk of obesity ', ' risk for obesity ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' community safety ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' social learning theory ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' exercise intervention ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' Text Messaging ', ' texting ', ' short message service ', ' adult obesity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' health goals ', ' ']",NIDDK,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2019,640764,0.16754694788435862
"Pre- to Post-Immigration Drinking and Driving among Recent Latino Immigrants: Examining Opportunities for Intervention Abstract  It has been posited that recent Latino immigrants may be at higher risk for involvement with driving while impaired (DWI) due to a failure of fully understanding the risks associated with DWI as a result of cultural norms from their countries of origin, including lax enforcement of DWI laws. Yet, the literature shows that, in general, Latino immigrants are less likely to drive while impaired than their U.S.-born counterparts, albeit DWI rates vary sharply by country of origin. Beyond these broad results, there is a scarcity of knowledge regarding the drinking and driving trajectories of recent Latino immigrants. A preliminary study conducted by this research team examined drinking and driving behaviors in a sample of Latino immigrants in Miami-Dade County, FL, approximately 7 years after immigration. Results indicated that compared to the most established immigrants in the sample (permanent residents), undocumented immigrants were less likely to understand DWI laws, more likely to binge drink, and less likely to perceive the associated risks. Despite such elevated risk factors, undocumented immigrants were less likely to be involved in DWI events than permanent residents, in part because of their desire to stay undetected by law officers, but largely because of their limited access to cars. Interestingly, our preliminary study found that riding with an impaired driver (RWID) was a rather prevalent risk even upon arrival. Given that it is not hindered by driving limitations, RWID constitutes a more immediate (and overlooked) risk for immigrants than DWI. Thus, our preliminary work suggests a picture in which Latino immigrants, despite some contributing risk factors, do not drive while impaired immediately after arriving to the country, but such behavior increases over time. Such a transition period offers an opportunity for early intervention to deter not only DWI but also RWID, as these behaviors are to some extent related. This application will begin examining this opportunity.  The proposed study will take advantage of the lessons learned from our cross-sectional exploratory study to provide a detailed examination of the DWI/RWID phenomena among recent Latino immigrants as they evolve from pre-immigration through their first 3 years in the United States. These initial years have been identified as a period of significant change and stress for immigrants that can determine future DWI/RWID outcomes. The ultimate goal of the study is to acquire a detailed understanding of the environmental, demographic, and sociocultural factors influencing the early adoption of DWI/RWID trajectories.

"Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO This application proposes an interdisciplinary Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO), with the unifying theme of conducting and promoting multi-level community-based participatory research to prevent SAVA syndemic conditions (substance abuse, violence/trauma and HIV/AIDS) and reduce their adverse health and mental health consequences. The emphasis of the Center will be on tailored interventions for Latino subgroups who represent pockets of vulnerability and require precise and specialized interventions that optimize access to and impact of interventions. CLaRO will unite and advance the work undertaken during the past decade by two NIMHD Centers of Excellence: the P60 Center of Excellence for Health Disparities Research (El Centro), at the University of Miami (UM), and the P20 Center of Excellence within the Center for Research on US Latino HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse (CRUSADA), at Florida International University (FIU). Both originating centers have well-established research infrastructures and strong records of achievement in translating research findings into meaningful, culturally relevant clinical practice for vulnerable Latinos. In this application, we propose two behavioral intervention studies, each of which advances the work of the existing collaborating Centers of Excellence. Research Project 1 will develop a culturally tailored intervention directed at preventing and reducing SAVA conditions among seasonal farmworker men and will be packaged, in collaboration with the Community/Scientific Advisory Board (CSAB), for community dissemination. Research Project 2 adapts and tests an intervention, developed at El Centro, for preventing and reducing self-harm and other SAVA-related behaviors in Latina and sexual/gender minority youth. The two Research Projects will be integrated through a common set of data points to measure risk and protective factors, moderators, and SAVA indicators related to the CLaRO theme. The common data elements will be expanded as CLaRO evolves to include biological and community-level measures. This application leverages the success of the originating Centers of Excellence and considerable institutional resources to advance investigator development at the applicant institution (UM). We propose a Pilot Projects Program, which will be articulated with scientific resources, training and mentorship, and will fund up to 35 studies, serving as an engine for the advancement of early-stage investigators and for diversifying the workforce of successful health disparities investigators. The CLaRO theme, agenda, and priorities were developed in collaboration with a network of community partners who will play an ongoing role in guiding and disseminating CLaRO science and advancing neighborhood capacity building and multilevel interventions to promote health in Latino communities. Miami-Dade County— with its large and diverse Latino population, who face individual, social and structural risk factors and have high prevalence of substance abuse, HIV and violence/trauma—provides the ideal laboratory for advancing the science of Latino health and health disparities. The proposed Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities: CLaRO, will conduct and promote research to advance interventions tailored for Latino groups who experience the greatest health risks, such as seasonal farmworkers, sexual/gender minority individuals and youth. The focus will be on community-based interventions that can have the greatest impact by addressing the root causes of the intertwined health conditions of substance abuse, violence/trauma, and HIV/AIDS. CLaRO will also contribute to the reduction and eventual elimination of health disparities by training, mentoring, and supporting the next generation of health disparities scientists. ",Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO,9693076,U54MD002266,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Family Research ', ' Florida ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' farm worker ', ' farmworker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' social ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' TIM1 ', ' P60 ', ' GEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Common Data Element ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' minority health ', ' systems research ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' computer aided ', ' next generation ', ' Trauma ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' stem ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' service coordination ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,U54,2019,2586887,0.09434028897458971
"Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 proposal is to develop a culturally tailored nutrition communication intervention for primary prevention of breast cancer among bicultural Latinas. The overarching goal of the study is to advance understanding of how communication and acculturation processes influence cancer risk behaviors in order to design effective culturally tailored interventions to reduce cancer risk behaviors. This approach is particularly relevant when considering research on the health of the population of CA's San Joaquin Valley (SJV). A vast, largely rural region that produces over half of the nation's fruit, nuts, and vegetables, SJV is 50% Latino, mostly of Mexican origin6. The SJV has a very diverse Latino population: 25% are foreign-born, and their primary language may be an indigenous Mexican language rather than Spanish, while 75% are native-born U.S. citizens, who possess varied fluency in English abilities and whose families may include both legal and undocumented immigrants. The linguistic and acculturative diversity of this population poses new challenges for understanding how to design effective behavior change interventions. Most community-based interventions with Latinos have focused on those who speak Spanish exclusively, limiting our understanding of how acculturation and linguistic diversity impact communication intervention design and effectiveness. mHealth strategies offer a way of delivering interventions that are not only culturally appropriate for Latinos across the acculturation spectrum, but also appropriate for primary cancer prevention among young adults who are eager adopters of technology. This study aims to fill the knowledge gaps through a research plan designed around three sequential aims employing mixed methods for message testing and community intervention research. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with SJV Latinas (N=25) to explore factors that influence diet and food preparation behaviors as well as barriers and facilitators to the adoption of healthier diets. Results will inform the content categories for message tailoring, the structure of the messages, and the means of dissemination. In Aim 2, we will use the findings from Aim 1 to build and test a library of messages that are culturally appropriate for bicultural Latinas using focus groups and cognitive interviews. Aim 3 is the design, pilot test, and evaluation of an intervention to improve diet behaviors. The intervention consists of a series of culturally appropriate messages, developed in Aim 2, tailored to each participant's needs and preferences, to be disseminated via mobile phone over a 4-week period. We will evaluate preliminary outcomes (e.g., usage and feedback about the intervention and changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions) at four different times. We will determine preliminary estimates of effect size for behavioral outcomes (consumption of dietary fat, fruits and vegetables), based on two post-intervention data collections. We will additionally evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability in order to refine the intervention for a future larger randomized controlled trial, to be proposed in an R01 application before the end of this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The demographic and risk factor profiles for Latinos suggest a looming cancer epidemic: Latinos are younger, poorer, and less likely to have access to cancer screening than the general population. The ""Acculturation Paradox"" further suggests that acculturation is a risk factor for diet-related breast cancer risk. This project aims to improve eating behaviors as a primary cancer prevention strategy, and the emphasis on young adult, bicultural Latinas focuses on those at high preventable cancer risk. The overall goals of this career development grant are to improve understanding of (a) factors that influence Latinas' cancer-related behaviors that may be modifiable through communication-based strategies, and (b) factors that influence Latinas' communication preferences and intervention effectiveness, in order to inform a culturally appropriate mHealth intervention.",Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas,9728890,K01CA190659,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' dietary lipid ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' Epidemic ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Fruit ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Group Interviews ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Nuts ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native-Born ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention ', ' prevent breast cancer ', ' mammary tumor prevention ', ' mammary cancer prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' good diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' behavior change ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Categories ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modality ', ' Health Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' food preparation ', ' Latina ', ' Latinas ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' community intervention ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' tailored messaging ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' reduced food intake ', ' reduced eating ', ' eat less ', ' ethnic identity ', ' cognitive interview ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, MERCED",K01,2019,126865,0.023015295420747706
"Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community members Recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, including skin and respiratory irritation and asthma, as well as potential reproductive effects and breast cancer. Nonetheless, the production and distribution of these products continues to expand. In response public health actions have aimed to reduce exposures through substituting use of environmentally safer products in public buildings and schools and encouraging development of certified environmentally safer product labels. While these initiatives have been successful at reaching certain groups of workers and consumers, low wage domestic and other cleaning workers, who are disproportionately immigrant and Latino, have been largely left out due to factors including knowledge, awareness, cost and accessibility. The Safe and Just Cleaners Project aims to address this environmental health disparity by documenting and reducing exposures to cleaning agents among domestic cleaning workers in the Latino immigrant worker community in NYC, as part of a University- Community partnership. The rationale for this project is that once domestic cleaners, as part of a large and influential community-based organization, gain capacity and knowledge to recognize their exposures and potential risks as workers, this will lay the basis for building a joint worker-community effort that will simultaneously a) improve conditions for themselves as cleaning workers, and b) reduce exposure to hazardous cleaning agents in the larger community of which the workers are a part. Working collaboratively with the largest Latino immigrant community-based organization in NYC, with 30,000 members, the project will survey Latino domestic workers about their use, work practices, values, knowledge and attitudes about potential hazards and self-reported health problems associated with consumer cleaning product use. The project will then identify and quantitatively evaluate the exposure levels and conditions that result in inhalation and dermal exposures to volatile organic and quaternary ammonium compounds, two major and potentially toxic components of commercial cleaning agents, among Latino immigrant domestic cleaning workers. The project will measure exposures both at the time of cleaning as well as residual exposures that might continue to contaminate home environments even after cleaning tasks are complete. These findings will be used to develop and implement a multilevel strategic campaign to reduce exposures among immigrant communities through local and national partnerships. Embedding this campaign within a workers’ rights and social justice perspective provides an approach that educates people about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures. Although recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, important populations of users of the agents - low wage domestic cleaning workers who are mainly immigrant and Latino - have inadequate knowledge and limited access to safer alternatives, whether using these products at work or at home. The Safe and Just Cleaners/Limpieza Sana y Justa Project will document exposures to cleaning agents among the Latino immigrant domestic cleaners in NYC. Using a workers’ rights and social justice perspective, the project’s public health campaign will inform Latino domestic cleaners and their communities about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures.",Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community members,9605788,R01ES027890,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Ammonia ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' Community Workers ', ' Disinfectants ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Industrialization ', ' Influentials ', ' Irritants ', ' Joints ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Language ', ' New York ', ' Privatization ', ' Product Labeling ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' airway symptom ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' Social Justice ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' skin irritation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Dermal ', ' Policies ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' irritation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' respiratory ', ' Inhalation Exposure ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' quaternary ammonium compound ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Allergic ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' reproductive ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' high risk ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' dermal exposure ', ' citizen science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' crowd science ', ' civic science ', ' citizen scientists ', ' amateur scientists ', ' amateur science ', ' community partnership ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIEHS,QUEENS COLLEGE,R01,2019,568397,0.03774989348207236
"Risk Factors For Worse Lung Function In Latinos With Cystic Fibrosis 7. PROJECT SUMMARY Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the second most common inherited childhood disease in the United States. CF is commonly thought of as a disease occurring only in whites; however, a third of patients in California are Latino. Latinos with CF have more severe lung disease and are 85% more likely to die annually than non-Latino white CF patients. Risk factors for severe lung function has been well-described in whites with CF, yet little is known about risk factors for severe lung function in Latinos. Our overall hypothesis is that Latinos have worse lung function than non-Latino Whites due to differences in the exposure and impact of risk factors that determine lung function in CF. To test this hypothesis, we will investigate if Latinos acquire different respiratory infections or if infections affect lung function differentially than among non-Latino whites (Aim 1). Maintenance medications improve lung function, but have not been studied specifically in Latinos. We will investigate the impact of these medications in Latinos (Aim 2). However, some important environmental and healthcare- related risk factors for lung function have not been collected by the CF Patient Registry. In our pilot cohort, we will recruit Latino and non-Latino white children with CF to collect data on these potential risk factors: air pollution, secondhand smoke, language spoken, and acculturation (Aim 3). To investigate medication response in Latinos, we will collect data about medical literacy and compliance (Aim 3). I have assembled a team of experienced scientists to address this critically important hypothesis, led by primary mentors Drs. Burchard and Nielson. I am well equipped to successfully accomplish these training and research goals with a foundation of formal training in pediatric pulmonary, pediatric clinical pharmacology, and clinical research and the support of my mentors. In order to become a successful independent investigator in health disparities in cystic fibrosis, I need further training and hands-on experience in the following areas: methods to study health disparities in minority populations; developing and managing a pediatric cohort study; training in advanced biostatistics and study design in CF research; and overall research career development. This proposed research may identify potentially modifiable risk factors that differentially affect lung function in Latinos with CF. Interventions targeting these identified risk factors could improve the health of Latinos with CF, allowing them to have longer and more fulfilling lives. Importantly, this proposed K23 research and training plan will provide me with the essential tools for a successful R01 application and to advance my career in CF research. 8. PROJECT NARRATIVE Compared to whites, Latinos with cystic fibrosis have more severe pulmonary disease and are more likely to die annually. This health disparity is a growing public health problem as Latinos represent an increasing proportion of cystic fibrosis patients.

"Pre- to Post-Immigration Drinking and Driving among Recent Latino Immigrants: Examining Opportunities for Intervention Abstract  It has been posited that recent Latino immigrants may be at higher risk for involvement with driving while impaired (DWI) due to a failure of fully understanding the risks associated with DWI as a result of cultural norms from their countries of origin, including lax enforcement of DWI laws. Yet, the literature shows that, in general, Latino immigrants are less likely to drive while impaired than their U.S.-born counterparts, albeit DWI rates vary sharply by country of origin. Beyond these broad results, there is a scarcity of knowledge regarding the drinking and driving trajectories of recent Latino immigrants. A preliminary study conducted by this research team examined drinking and driving behaviors in a sample of Latino immigrants in Miami-Dade County, FL, approximately 7 years after immigration. Results indicated that compared to the most established immigrants in the sample (permanent residents), undocumented immigrants were less likely to understand DWI laws, more likely to binge drink, and less likely to perceive the associated risks. Despite such elevated risk factors, undocumented immigrants were less likely to be involved in DWI events than permanent residents, in part because of their desire to stay undetected by law officers, but largely because of their limited access to cars. Interestingly, our preliminary study found that riding with an impaired driver (RWID) was a rather prevalent risk even upon arrival. Given that it is not hindered by driving limitations, RWID constitutes a more immediate (and overlooked) risk for immigrants than DWI. Thus, our preliminary work suggests a picture in which Latino immigrants, despite some contributing risk factors, do not drive while impaired immediately after arriving to the country, but such behavior increases over time. Such a transition period offers an opportunity for early intervention to deter not only DWI but also RWID, as these behaviors are to some extent related. This application will begin examining this opportunity.  The proposed study will take advantage of the lessons learned from our cross-sectional exploratory study to provide a detailed examination of the DWI/RWID phenomena among recent Latino immigrants as they evolve from pre-immigration through their first 3 years in the United States. These initial years have been identified as a period of significant change and stress for immigrants that can determine future DWI/RWID outcomes. The ultimate goal of the study is to acquire a detailed understanding of the environmental, demographic, and sociocultural factors influencing the early adoption of DWI/RWID trajectories. This knowledge will be used to inform culturally relevant intervention strategies for preventing DWI/RWID in the target population.

"SALUD: Syndemic Alcohol Use Disorders, Violence, and HIV/STI in Young Latino Men Project Summary: Given the pervasive disparities in alcohol use disorders (AUD) and HIV among young Latino men, the proposed training plan will build upon my work on HIV transmission risk and co-morbidities by training me in: 1) alcohol and HIV epidemiology, 2) the integration of biological measures with behavioral science, and 3) longitudinal data analysis, while expanding the scope of my health disparities research to include Latino men. With the guidance of my exceptional Mentor Team, the proposed training aims will be achieved with a combination of in-/formal coursework and workshops in alcohol epidemiology, stress response biomarkers, and longitudinal statistical methods as well as practical experience in primary data collection, assay, and analysis, of salivary, urinary, and blood stress biomarkers with behavioral data in ethnic minority populations. In addition, this K01 will provide me with guidance to develop skills for a successful academic career and support for my transition into an independent investigator. Men make up 87% of new HIV infections among Latinos. Latino men play a central role in bridging HIV/STI across sexual networks due to their sexual risk behaviors (e.g., concurrent sex partners, unprotected anal sex, same-sex [MSM] activity). Furthermore, harmful alcohol use increases risk behavior and IPV perpetration, all factors associated with a substantially increased risk for HIV/STI. The syndemic co-occurrence of AUD, intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV/STI is theorized to take root in systemic socio-structural disadvantage, but the mechanisms causing this syndemic are not well understood, especially in Latino men. The Social Stress Theory suggests that social inequity elevates exposure and vulnerability to stress, limits access to coping resources, and increases AUD and HIV disparities. The proposed longitudinal, epidemiological study aims to elucidate the temporal sequence of AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI, as well as identify risk/protective social stress factors in Latino men (versus white men) during their critical transition from adolescence (12-18 years) to mid-adulthood (32-42 years). To achieve this, we propose secondary analysis of four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (n=5,140), which contains rich social, behavioral, and biological data (e.g., stress response, HIV/STI biomarkers). Findings from this research will inform the development of more effective AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI prevention and treatment interventions for Latino men, and will highlight sub-group nuances among Latino men (e.g., by non-/white race, national sub-group, and sexual orientation). Classified as High Priority by the NIH Office of AIDS Research, this K01 will provide cross- cutting research training for a highly productive ethnic minority junior investigator to conduct HIV/AIDS Research to Reduce Latino Health Disparities in the incidence of new HIV infections and to understand the role of chronic inflammation and AUD in exacerbating these disparities. Project narrative: SALUD (Cheers/Health) aims to elucidate the temporal sequence of alcohol use disorders (AUD), intimate partner violence (IPV), and HIV/STI, and to identify risk/protective socio- structural factors, and stress and coping factors among Latino men (versus white men; n=5,140) in their critical transition from adolescence (12-18 years) to mid-adulthood (32-42 years). Identifying socio-structural and stress and coping targets for intervention will inform the development of more effective AUD, IPV, and HIV/STI prevention and treatment interventions for Latino men. Furthermore, the proposed training in alcohol and HIV epidemiology, integration of biological measures with behavioral science, and longitudinal data analysis will provide cross- cutting research training for a productive ethnic minority junior investigator in areas classified as High Priority (by the NIH Office of AIDS Research), and position her as an independent investigator and leader in Latino disparities in alcohol and HIV.","SALUD: Syndemic Alcohol Use Disorders, Violence, and HIV/STI in Young Latino Men",9902265,K01AA025009,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', '

"Diabetes disparities in Latino subpopulations: linking biology to social epidemiology Abstract The overall goal for this application for an NIDDK Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) is to provide the candidate, Sandra Albrecht, PhD, MPH, with indispensable training and protected time to build an independent, transdisciplinary research program at the interface of the biomedical and socio-ecological domains to provide a more complete understanding of the factors underlying progression to and from type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Latino subpopulations. Responding to the staggering burden of T2D and poor glucose control in U.S. Latinos, to unanswered questions regarding variation in disease risk and burden within this broad population, and to the dearth of longitudinal studies in this area, the research aims are to 1) Characterize patterns of glucose dysregulation over time in non-diabetic Latino ethnic subgroups, and evaluate the role of social, environmental, and clinical factors in driving that variation; (2) Characterize patterns of T2D progression over time in diabetic Latino ethnic subgroups, and evaluate the role of social, environmental, and clinical factors in driving that variation; and (3) Characterize the effectiveness of a key social determinant – healthcare utilization - for successful T2D management within a specific Latino subpopulation, and evaluate how other social, environmental, and clinical factors modify that effectiveness. Data for Aims 1 and 2 will come from a large national longitudinal population-based study with oversamples of Latino subgroups: the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos. Data for Aim 3 will come from electronic health record data from a large healthcare system in North Carolina, a region with a fast growing Latino population. As part of this aim, Latino diabetic subjects will be recruited for a pilot study evaluating self-reported barriers to achieving control of glucose as part of a long-term effort to integrate social factors into the clinical management of T2D. To match the scope of the proposed scientific work, the candidate will seek to integrate her expertise in the social epidemiology of obesity and diabetes with the following career development and training areas: 1) training in the physiology of glucose dysregulation; 2) understanding of clinical issues relevant to T2D prevention and treatment; and 3) use of electronic health records data and health informatics. This training will be augmented with career-building activities to acquire essential tools for leadership and professional growth, as well as dissemination and translation of findings. Experts have emphasized the need for a more complete understanding of subgroup-specific T2D physiology and of subgroup-specific risk factors underlying progression to and from T2D. This K01 project will impact public health by improving characterization of T2D outcomes in Latino subpopulations to inform tailored prevention and treatment strategies. The project builds upon exceptional resources and mentoring at the candidate's institution (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), to train her in key new areas, bolster applications for competitive funding, disseminate findings among researchers and the wider community, augment faculty diversity, and attain research independence. Project Narrative This proposal addresses a central challenge in type 2 diabetes (T2D) research: prioritizing efforts to reduce disparities in U.S. Latinos. With this award, I will build an independent, transdisciplinary research program at the interface of the biomedical and socio-ecological domains to provide a more complete understanding of the factors underlying progression to and from T2D specific to Latinos. This research will inform translational approaches to reduce T2D burden taking into the account the enormous variability of the U.S. Latino population.",Diabetes disparities in Latino subpopulations:

"Culturally Competent Communication Intervention to Improve Latinos' Engagement in Advance Care Planning PROJECT SUMMARY Compared to whites, Latinos are much less likely to engage in various forms of advance care planning (ACP), including completing advance directives and having end-of-life (EOL) discussions. ACP is critical to provision of quality EOL care, as it has been associated with greater likelihood of patients' EOL wishes being followed. Latino advanced cancer patients are also significantly more likely than their white counterparts to receive futile and burdensome aggressive care at the end-of-life, to die in the ICU, and to have care that runs counter to their preferences and values. Dr. Shen's pilot work, along with the current literature, suggests that targeting ACP may help improve Latinos' EOL care. As such, the proposed project will develop and pilot-test a culturally competent communication (CCC) intervention. First, the CCC intervention will be developed based on results from a questionnaire embedded into a current R01 (MPIs: Prigerson, Maciejewski) assessing Latinos' cultural, familial, and religious beliefs as well as their knowledge, motivation (readiness), and action to engage in ACP (n=200). Next, the developed CCC intervention will be vetted among Latino stakeholders and field-tested among Latino advanced cancer patients, using an iterative approach (n=40) to guide the finalization of the intervention. Finally, a pilot randomized trial will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the CCC intervention at improving engagement in ACP. Participants (n=50) will be randomly assigned to the intervention (n=25) or attention control group (n=25). Results will provide timely insight into a potentially effective, low burden intervention designed to improve Latinos' engagement in ACP. Dr. Shen is the ideal candidate to spearhead this line of research given her academic background in social psychology and communication research. Dr. Shen's long-term career goal is to lead a program of social scientific research that develops social psychological interventions designed to improve EOL communication and care, with expertise in interventions targeting racial/ethnic minorities. To achieve this goal, as part of her K07, Dr. Shen will receive intensive training in five key areas: (1) EOL care research; (2) clinical intervention development; (3) technology-based health interventions; (4) health disparities, and (5) professional development. The K07 will provide Dr. Shen with several avenues to achieve her training and research goals and enhance her expertise. Dr. Shen will have ongoing meetings with mentors and expert advisors and participate in formal coursework, didactics, workshops, conferences, interactive trainings, and guided research experience. The proposed K07 will form the foundation for a program of research that focuses on developing social psychological interventions to improve EOL communication and care. At the end of the K07 funding period, Dr. Shen will submit an R01 application, based on the results of the present study. Overall, the K07 will provide Dr. Shen with the research experience, intensive training, and mentorship needed to become a successful independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has significant public health relevance and is consistent with the broader goals of public health focuses on improving communication regarding end-of-life care. The development of a Culturally Competent Communication Intervention designed to coach Latino advanced cancer patients in how to communicate EOL goals of care in order to improve their engagement in advance care planning will help reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in advance care planning and potentially end-of-life care. If the Culturally Competent Communication Intervention proves to be potentially efficacious, there is a strong argument for testing this intervention in a larger, multi-site study to test for effectiveness.",Culturally Competent Communication Intervention to Improve Latinos' Engagement in Advance Care Planning,9968190,K07CA207580,"['Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Belief ', ' Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Do Not Resuscitate Order ', ' Do Not Resuscitate ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Proxy ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' end of life care ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Dominican ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Communication Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' social communication ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' end of life communication ', ' end-of-life communication ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' attentional control ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K07,2020,172260,0.13521113534248588
"Feasibility of a Novel Systems Approach for Improving Utilization of Alzheimer's Disease Services Among Latinos Attending Primary Care Practices Abstract I underwent graduate training in aging and health disparities epidemiology and I have currently completed a Diversity Supplement funded by the National Institute on Aging (3P30AG035982-07S1). My research training in aging, epidemiology and health disparities combined with my more recent experience in conducting community-engaged research and conducting clinical assessment of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), provides me with a foundation for pursuing my goal of establishing an independent research program to address disparities in ADRD experienced by Latinos. This K01 Career Development Award is designed to fill additional gaps in training in my areas of interest to move me towards my goals, including 1) Developing advanced knowledge and skills in evidence-based ADRD care; 2) Gaining advanced knowledge and skills to conduct health systems research and 3) Gaining knowledge and training in collecting and analyzing qualitative data. I would benefit greatly from the protected time and the training plan provided by this award to complete my training to successfully develop an independent research program focused on addressing disparities in ADRD experienced by Latinos. The K01 mechanism will support me with dedicated time to advance my knowledge and skills in evidence-based ADRD care, health systems research and qualitative research. In addition to these training experiences, I have proposed a unique research proposal in line with my learning objectives. I plan to 1) Examine the current primary care models of ADRD care to identify what services are offered and how they are delivered across a variety of settings and 2) Test the feasibility and acceptability of Alianza Latina, a health systems approach to reduce disparities in ADRD diagnosis and care experienced by Latinos. My training to date will provide a solid foundation to build upon as I gain first-hand experience in areas where gaps in my training exist. The K01 award will provide the financial assistance and protected time necessary to successfully achieve these training objectives and provide a successful transition to independence. Project Narrative Latinos experience substantial disparities in ADRD diagnosis and care compared to their non-Latino white peers, putting them at an increased risk for steeper cognitive decline, morbidity, mortality and caregiver burden.

"Understanding the Multiple-levels of Influence on Access to Care for Latino Youth PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT There are over 18 million Latinos under the age of 18 in the US, and they make up one-fourth of the total youth population. There is consistent and rigorous evidence that Latino youth have historically had the worst patterns of health care access and utilization of any group of youth, even after controlling for variables such as insurance and family income. Access to care is even worse for the over 50% of Latino youth who have immigrant parents. These disparities are likely the result of multiple levels of youth and family, community, policy and societal factors. There is a dearth of evidence, however, on both the individual influence and the joint influence of these levels. California is an ideal state in which to study the complexities of access to care for Latino youth because it has the largest Latino and immigrant populations in the country with considerable variability in family citizenship and documentation compositions. State and national health surveys do not commonly measure the many dimensions of family citizenship and documentation statuses and health care eligibility, and these surveys generally have limited measures of health care access and utilization at the youth- and family-levels. The California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) is the largest annual representative statewide health survey in the country and collects data on youth and parent citizenship and documentation statuses, which allows for the unique opportunity to examine the effects of variabilities in family citizenship and documentation statuses on health care access and utilization for youth. We plan to conduct a follow-up study of 1,000 Latino youth and their families in the 2021 and 2022 CHIS waves. Our approach will allow us to combine baseline CHIS data with newly collected data from follow-up interviews and county-level data to examine disparities in youth's access to and utilization of health care. We will also determine how disparities vary by youth, parent and sibling citizenship and documentation compositions and the extent to which youth and family, community, policy and societal factors influence them. Using the NIMHD Research Framework and Warnecke et al.'s model for population health and health disparities, we will address 4 specific aims in the context of families' citizenship and documentation status compositions: 1) estimating the disparities in access to and utilization of health care for Latino youth according to youth- and family-level factors; 2) understanding the processes and facilitators that increase the likelihood that Latino youth access and use services; 3) identifying how parental trust in health systems and institutions influence the determinants of health care access and utilization for Latino youth; and 4) understanding how variations in county-level policy and societal contexts influence health services use for Latino youth. The project will provide critical information on how the effects of multiple levels of influence affect access and utilization of care for Latino youth and will offer evidence to guide policy and practice interventions to improve access to care for Latino youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latino youth face longstanding disparities in health care access and utilization, especially the 9 million youth in immigrant families who represent half of Latino youth in the US. This study will take advantage of a unique opportunity to examine the multiple levels of influence that contribute to these disparities through a follow-up study of 1000 Latino youth and their families in the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS). California has the largest Latino and immigrant populations in the country, and CHIS captures the many unique dimensions of family citizenship and documentation statuses, making them an ideal state and survey in which to study health care disparities for Latino youth and families.",Understanding the Multiple-levels of Influence on Access to Care for Latino Youth,9971871,R01MD014146,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Joints ', ' Laws ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Medicaid ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Siblings ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Caring ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Data Files ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Immigrant ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' Participant ', ' Exclusion ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Health Communication ', ' Improve Access ', ' Population Analysis ', ' Societal Factors ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' minority health ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' Population ', ' safety net ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' Secure ', ' Preventative health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' Obamacare ', ' Affordable Care Act ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' welfare ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' ']",NIMHD,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,568529,0.10512540442121017
"Bridging the evidence-to-practice gap: Evaluating practice facilitation as a strategy to accelerate translation of a systems-level adherence intervention into safety net practices Project Summary: Despite increasing awareness and treatment of hypertension (HTN) across all racial/ethnic groups, Latinos have the lowest blood pressure (BP) control rates in the US (Latino adults: 34% vs. 43% and 53% in non-Hispanic black and white adults). These statistics may be explained by the disproportionately poorer adherence to antihypertensive medications among Latinos compared to blacks and whites. Systems- level interventions conducted in primary care settings have improved medication adherence in minority populations. Our Ayudando a Latinos Hipertensos Para Mejorar Adherencia a sus Medicamentos (ALMA) trial, which informs this proposal significantly improved both BP control (51 vs. 29%, p=.04) and medication adherence (78 vs. 72%, p=.02) compared to enhanced usual care in a sample of 119 Latino patients followed in a safety-net practice. Despite their efficacy, evidence-based interventions like ALMA often take up to 17 years to be translated into clinical practice. Implementation strategies are sorely needed to accelerate the translation of evidence-based interventions into routine “real world” safety-net practices, in order to reduce disparities in BP control in vulnerable populations. Practice facilitation (PF) is one method to accelerate the implementation of evidence-based interventions into healthcare settings. Through PF, a facilitator works with healthcare teams to develop the skills to adapt and implement evidence-based system changes and promotes a tailored approach to integrating those changes into the clinic workflow. Although evidence supports the effect of PF for preventive screenings (e.g., breast examination), its impact on implementing evidence-based systems approaches to support HTN management in safety-net practices remains largely untested. This proposal provides an opportunity to fill this evidence-to-practice gap by evaluating the effectiveness of PF as a practical and replicable strategy for implementing ALMA in a network of 12 safety-net Family Health Centers (FHCs) in New York City. Using a mixed-methods design, we will conduct this study in two phases: (1) A pre- implementation phase where we will refine the PF strategy, informed by our prior work, based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to facilitate the implementation of ALMA at the FHCs. (2) An implementation phase, during which we will evaluate, in a pragmatic cluster-randomized controlled trial, the effect of the PF strategy compared to a self-directed condition (i.e., receipt of information for implementing ALMA but no facilitation) on implementation fidelity (primary outcome) of ALMA and on clinical outcomes (secondary outcome) at 12 months among a sample of 650 Latinos with uncontrolled HTN cared for at the FHCs. Implementation fidelity will be assessed using a mixed methods approach based on the five core dimensions of implementation fidelity, as defined by Proctor’s Implementation Outcomes Framework. Clinical outcome measures include BP control (defined as <140/90 mmHg) and medication adherence (assessed using the proportion of days covered via pharmacy records). Project Narrative: Latinos with hypertension (HTN) are twice as likely to have uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) compared to whites, despite similar prevalence of HTN in both groups; poor adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications among Latinos may explain this racial gap. Despite a wealth of research dedicated to developing interventions to improve medication adherence in patients with uncontrolled HTN, the translation of these interventions into routine practice within “real world” safety-net primary care settings has been inadequate and slow. Identifying practical and replicable strategies that are effective for facilitating the translation of efficacious interventions into routine practice in safety-net settings are sorely needed to improve the poor rates of medication adherence and BP control among Latinos—thereby supporting the goals of the health care reform law to ensure the delivery of efficient and high quality health care services through coordinated, comprehensive and patient-centered care.",Bridging the evidence-to-practice gap: Evaluating practice facilitation as a strategy to accelerate translation of a systems-level adherence intervention into safety net practices,9912196,R01MD013769,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Antihypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Agents ', ' Anti-Hypertensive Drugs ', ' Anti-Hypertensives ', ' Antihypertensive Drugs ', ' Antihypertensives ', ' Hypotensive Agent ', ' Hypotensive Drugs ', ' Hypotensives ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Standardization ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Health Reform ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Ensure ', ' Individual ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dimensions ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' skills ', ' BP control ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP management ', ' BP regulation ', ' blood pressure control ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure management ', ' regulate BP ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Translation Process ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' systematic review ', ' Preventative screening ', ' Preventive screening ', ' hypertension treatment ', ' implementation research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' safety net ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' routine care ', ' routine practice ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' hypertension management ', ' hypertension control ', ' clinical practice ', ' arm ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' formative evaluation ', ' formative assessment ', ' Self-Direction ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' precision approach ', ' tailored approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' implementation strategy ', ' breast examination ', ' breast exam ', ' health goals ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,718623,0.051315580919368435
"Linking state policies to Latino and Asian American immigrant health care access Project Summary/Abstract While many immigrants arrive in the US with good health status, there are persistent disparities in access to health care for immigrant groups that may contribute to their more than expected health declines over time, particularly among the nation's two largest immigrant populations, Latinos and Asians. Since the late 1990s there has also been a proliferation of public policies at the state level that have an impact on immigrant populations. There is growing evidence that immigrant policies are a structural factor associated with disparities in Latino and Asian immigrant health care access. Yet, there is limited understanding of the processes by which policy, a contextual factor, has an impact on individual-level health care access outcomes. This study aims to examine the pathways between state policy and access to care by (1) identifying and assessing the variation among Latino and Asian immigrants' experiences of exclusion related to immigrant policies, (2) understanding the extent to which experiences of policy-related exclusion are associated with barriers to health care, and (3) assessing the extent to which those associations are modified by citizenship status, race/ethnicity, and knowledge of policies. We will conduct a mixed-methods study of the experiences of exclusion among Latino and Asian immigrants in California, a demographically diverse state with a range of state-level immigrant policies. We will assess the association between access to health care and experiences of exclusion across five sectors: health care, social services, education, employment, and law enforcement. We will analyze data from the California Health Interview Survey (CHIS), a representative population survey of state residents, combined with a follow-up survey of 2,000 CHIS immigrant respondents that collects additional information on experiences related to immigrant policies. We will also conduct semi-structured interviews of immigrants in two regions to identify the nuances of their experiences of and responses to those policies. The findings from this research can both identify policies outside the health sector that have impacts on immigrant access to health care, and suggest educational interventions which could improve immigrant knowledge in ways that improves their access to needed health care. Project narrative This study will contribute to knowledge regarding the impact of public policies on access to health care by examining the experiences of Latino and Asian immigrants. It will build from research on the social determinants of health to understand the pathways between contextual social factors and individual-level health access outcomes.",Linking state policies to Latino and Asian American immigrant health care access,9928744,R01MD012292,"['Affect ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Awareness ', ' California ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Eligibility ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Employment ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Methods ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Law Enforcement ', ' base ', ' population survey ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Healthcare Sector ', ' Health Care Sector ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Exclusion ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' Latin American ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' protective factors ', ' social factors ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,592413,0.06449381085326938
"A mobile phone-based pilot intervention to prevent obesity in Latino preschool children Project Summary Child obesity disproportionately impacts young Latino children and has important implications for later adulthood weight and health problems. In-person parent-focused obesity prevention and control interventions are effective in establishing healthy weight behaviors and weight outcomes for young children, including Latino children. Widespread dissemination in healthcare and community settings pose several challenges including family participation barriers of time, cost, transportation, and English proficiency. The study goal is to pilot a stand-alone mobile phone intervention with Latino mothers, fathers, and grandparents, geared at building caregiver strategies to support evidence-based and age appropriate dietary, media-viewing, and physical activity practices among 2- to 5-year old children in order to resolve key challenges of traditional in- person pediatric obesity interventions (e.g. transportation, time), and also leverage important determinants of Latino health (e.g. familism, language). A prospective control group pilot study will be completed to assess acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary effect sizes on children's weight-related behaviors and BMI z-scores at 6 months post-intervention, in preparation for a larger randomized trial to evaluate the intervention's efficacy. The intervention will deliver 4 interactive texts every week for one month to Latino caregivers of 2 to 5-year old children and 2-months of mobile phone “booster” doses that incorporate behavioral change techniques using a group strategy, a cornerstone of many effective in-person parent-focused pediatric obesity interventions. The study will first use qualitative methods to maximize the acceptability and usability of the existing mobile phone group learning strategies with a small group of Latino mothers, fathers, and grandparents. A 4-week mobile phone pilot intervention will then be completed with 66 caregiver-child dyads recruited from two WIC sites in East Los Angeles. Eligible caregiver-child dyads will be randomly assigned into the mobile phone intervention group or the comparison group, in which caregivers receive usual WIC services. Acceptability and feasibility outcomes will include: (1) the number of families needed to be screened per month; (2) attrition rates of a mobile phone intervention with Latino populations; (3) dose and exposure of texts; (4) frequency of sharing/replying to texts by caregiver-type; (5) number of completed baseline and follow-up data; and (6) family-centeredness of the intervention. Pre- and post- intervention data will be collected at baseline, 1-month, and 6-months after the intervention begins in order to estimate preliminary effect sizes and standard deviations associated with child dietary, physical activity, and media viewing practices and BMI scores. Mediators of the intervention will include measures of caregiver self-efficacy, caregiver feeding practices, and group support. The pilot study will provide the acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary data on child weigh-related behaviors and BMI to develop an R01 proposal to test the intervention's effectiveness via a randomized controlled trial. Project Narrative Consumption of sweetened beverages, media-viewing, and physical activity patterns are often established during early childhood, and obesity interventions show effectiveness in shaping healthy behaviors and weight outcomes for young children, including Latino children. Despite this knowledge, however, such intervention programs have not been disseminated on a wide scale. The proposed research will pilot a stand-alone mobile phone early childhood obesity intervention for Latino families that incorporates evidence-based strategies of in- person childhood obesity interventions and leverages important determinants of Latino health (e.g. familism, language), in order to address an important methodology gap for the wide dissemination of evidence-based practices

"Preventing Diabetes in Latino Youth ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity and related health disparities represent some of the most significant public health challenges facing society. In particular, obese Latino adolescents are disproportionately impacted by insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Prediabetes is an intermediate stage in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and represents a critical opportunity for intervention. The Diabetes Prevention Program established that lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in adults with prediabetes. To date, no diabetes prevention studies have been conducted in obese Latino youth with prediabetes, a highly vulnerable and underserved group. Therefore, we propose a randomized-controlled trial to test the short-term (6-month) and long-term (12-month) efficacy of a culturally-grounded, lifestyle intervention, as compared to usual care, for improving glucose tolerance and reducing diabetes risk in 120 obese Latino adolescents with prediabetes. We will further test intervention effects on quality of life, explore the potential mediating effects of changes in total, regional, nd organ fat on improving glucose tolerance and increasing insulin sensitivity, and estimate the initial incremental cost- effectiveness of the intervention as compared with usual care for improving glucose tolerance. The overall approach is framed within a multilevel Ecodevelopmental model that leverages community, family, peer, and individual factors during the critical transition period of adolescence when changes in health behaviors and health outcomes are linked to future health trajectories. The intervention is guided by Social Cognitive Theory and employs key behavioral modification strategies to enhance self-efficacy and foster social support for making and sustaining healthy behavior changes. The application builds upon extant collaborations of a transdisciplinary team of investigators working in concert with local community agencies to address critical gaps in how diabetes prevention interventions for obese Latino youth are developed, implemented and evaluated. This innovative approach is an essential step in the development of scalable, cost-effective, solution- oriented programs to prevent type 2 diabetes in this and other populations of high-risk youth. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity and type 2 diabetes are critical public health issues in youth. This study will test the effects and estimate the cost-effectiveness of a culturally-grounded community-based lifestyle intervention on type 2 diabetes risk among obese Latino adolescents with prediabetes.",Preventing Diabetes in Latino Youth,9831157,R01DK107579,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', '

"Latino Ancestry Genomic Psychiatry Cohort Project Summary  The Latino Ancestry-Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (LA-GPC) is an expansion of the GPC into the Latino population. LA and other minority populations have been poorly represented in large-scale genomic studies, and yet these populations (i) suffer the largest disparities in health care and outcomes, and (ii) have the potential to broaden our knowledge of human genetics. In particular, LA genomes are admixed and are characterized by different haplotype blocks than European ancestry (EA) populations. As a consequence, genetic polymorphisms that are in perfect linkage disequilibrium (LD) in Europeans may be broken-up by recombination events in LA genomes, allowing the contributions of different genomic intervals to be assessed independently.  Progress to date: The GPC has enrolled and assessed over 5,000 new LA participants and we have recently published a pilot GWAS including both LA and African Ancestry (AA) participants. GWAS meta- analysis of PGC-SCZ2 with pilot results for 4,324 (cases and controls) LA-GPC participants yielded 8 new schizophrenia-associated risk loci, and for 9 loci there was a concomitant reduction in the number of SNPs in the associated interval. Crucially, the resultant cross-ancestry summary statistics, informed by multiple ancestrally diverse cohorts, yielded individual-level polygenic risk scores that explained more variance than analogous scores based on either ancestry alone  In Phase 1 of this renewal: we will study genome-wide common variation in our existing LA-GPC and VA- CS#572 combined cohort of 16,124 LA participants. In Phase 2, we will perform an expanded analysis by adding 8,000 new participants ascertained in the LA-GPC, 35,000 additional participants from the VA, 8,000 participants from the NeuroMex study (PI. Koenen), and 10,000 participants from the Colombian study (PI. Freimer). This meta-analysis will include over 77,000 LA participants, a sample of non-Caucasians with the potential for significant novel discovery. Project Narrative  Latino Ancestry and other minority populations have been poorly represented in large-scale genomic studies, and yet these populations suffer the largest disparities in health care and outcomes and have the potential to broaden our knowledge of human genetics. The Latino Ancestry-Genomic Psychiatry Cohort (LA-GPC) will combine the Latino Ancestry (AA) participants in this study, the VA-CSP study, the Colombian study and the NeuroMex study creating a study population over 76,000 LA participants.

"Juntos (Together): A community led approach to enhance to Covid-19 testing among vulnerable Latinos PROJECT SUMMARY Latinos are among the most heavily impacted communities by the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, with more than 3 times higher rate than non-Hispanic whites. To address this disparity, this team of investigators and community partners has established a multi-pronged approach that leverages the skill set of trusted bilingual/bicultural peer navigators (or promotoras) to address social determinants of health (SDOH) that create barriers to testing (such as lack of insurance, immigration status, stigmatization or loss of job/income), and to expand access to free COVID-19 testing in community settings. Our preliminary findings show that leveraging the promotora model for timely delivery of results (within 48 hours), paired with rapid linkage of COVID-19 positive patients to critical services (including clinical follow-up, food delivery, cash assistance, and/or isolation hotel), and referral of contacts for testing, increased acceptability and uptake of COVID-19 testing in a heavily impacted Latino community. The overall goal of this Phase I Testing Research Project called Juntos (Together) is to work closely with our community partners to systematically evaluate and refine current COVID-19 testing strategies, and to implement and evaluate innovative customized strategies to rapidly increase reach, access, acceptance, uptake, and sustainment of FDA-authorized/approved diagnostics (especially viral tests) for this highly vulnerable and health care marginalized community. Leveraging community partnerships and prior experience implementing an HIV testing campaign, we will develop and evaluate a customized Juntos COVID- 19 testing campaign to address specific common concerns in the Latino community and link users to existing Johns Hopkins COVID-19 community testing sites and to new options, including home-based and/or self- testing kits and rapid tests (Aim 1). To assess the overall impact of the Juntos COVID-19 Testing Project, we will rely on the latest in causal inference methods for evaluating population-level health interventions and implement a synthetic control analysis to compare testing uptake and positivity rate among Latinos in Baltimore City (intervention site) as compared to control zip codes across Maryland. (Aim 2). Finally, informed by Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) and RE-AIM framework, we will assess the implementation determinants, mechanisms, and outcomes of existing and novel Juntos testing interventions to inform future broad-scale implementation (Aim 3). We have assembled a multi-disciplinary team with methodological expertise in implementation science, community-based research, and laboratory medicine, and have a mature and long-standing collaboration with our partners at Esperanza Center, Casa de Maryland, the Mayor's Office of Immigrant Affairs, and religious leaders. Our team is enthusiastic to propose this implementation study to enhance access to testing for the Latino community, and will actively coordinate and share data and protocols with other grantees, the CDCC, and other research supported by the RADx-UP program. PROJECT NARRATIVE Latinos are among the most heavily impacted communities by the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need to promote COVID-19 testing and reduce disparities in the Latino community. In this grant, we propose to work closely with our community partners to implement and evaluate a COVID-19 testing strategy that is responsive to the needs of the Latino community, and includes testing in the community, a bilingual COVID-19 hotline, a website that connects people to reliable information and testing options, and the support of peer health navigators (or promotoras) to facilitate access to tests, results, and linkage to other services.",Juntos (Together): A community led approach to enhance to Covid-19 testing among vulnerable Latinos,10230852,R01DA045556,"['Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Baltimore ', ' Cities ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hotlines ', ' Telephone Hotlines ', ' Household ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Maryland ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' Custom ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Trust ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' uptake ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Glare ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Diagnostic ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Test Result ', ' Viral ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Modality ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' AIDS test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' HIV test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' implementation research ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' implementation science ', ' community setting ', ' health equity ', ' social health determinants ', ' data sharing ', ' peer support ', ' community partnership ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' phase 1 evaluation ', ' phase I evaluation ', ' phase I testing ', ' phase 1 testing ', ' Facebook ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' 2019 novel coronavirus ', ' SARS-CoV-2 ', ' SARS-CoV2 ', ' SARS-associated coronavirus 2 ', ' SARS-coronavirus-2 ', ' SARS-related coronavirus 2 ', ' Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ', ' Wuhan coronavirus ', ' 2019-nCoV ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NIDA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,1570444,0.15104034850508702
"Study of Latinos Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging 2 By 2060, the CDC projects that the Latino population will experience the largest increase in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) cases of all US ethnic/racial groups. The main, if not only, explanation oft echoed for disparately high Latino ADRD is attributed to early and excess cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity contributing to disparately high ADRD. CVD risk factors emerge earlier among Latinos in midlife, thereby increasing deleterious exposures to exquisitely sensitive and highly vascularized brain tissue. Yet, to- date there has not been any study of Latinos with sufficiently deep CVD phenotyping and genotyping to adequately address this significant public health question. This scientific knowledge gap is a significant impediment to the field and public health given continued and rapid Latino population growth projections, particularly for older adults. Latinos now represent nearly one-fifth of the US and 40% of its two most populous states, California and Texas. In coming decades, the older Latino population (>65 years) will quadruple (391%) and US public health is ill-prepared for forthcoming demographic and health-related shifts in the population. The Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA) is the only large, representative and ongoing longitudinal study of CVD, genomics and cognitive aging and ADRD in diverse Latinos. In this SOL- INCA renewal, we will leverage 10-years of deep CVD phenotyping, multi-layered -omics and rich sociocultural data to fill these neglected scientific gaps in our current understanding of ADRD in diverse Latinos. Project Narrative The Competitive Renewal of the Study of Latinos-Investigation of Neurocognitive Aging (SOL-INCA2) leverages the ongoing Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL; NHLBI; n=16,415) and its 10-years of rich cognitive, sociocultural, cardiovascular and genomic data to understand the biology of Latino Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. The SOL-INCA2 approach blends the NIA-AA research framework on Alzheimer's disease biomarkers and NIA Health Disparities Research Framework to discover if and when cardiovascular disease begins contributing to cognitive impairment and dementia to ultimately reduce Latino ADRD disparities. The SOL-INCA2 goal is to identify critical periods in adulthood when AD biomarkers and cognitive decline emerge to best guide ADRD public health prevention and therapeutic interventions for Latinos

"3/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center Overall- Project Summary The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically, the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican- Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics, Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos. Project Narrative The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at an ISUPS (FAMU), and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The proposed two full projects and pilot project include investigators from the three institutions and will leverage on specimens collected across the partnership from Blacks and Latinos, representing a wide range of subpopulations within these minority groups. Thus, our studies will reveal unprecedented findings about these two understudied minority populations. Importantly, these projects will be instrumental in transferring cutting edge and innovative technologies to FAMU, will provide research training opportunities across the partnership to 100 students, post-doctoral fellows, and early stage investigators, and will expand in a significant way the research focus at UF and USC-NCCC to address cancer health disparities in prostate and pancreas cancer.","3/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center",10005925,U54CA233465,"['Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Central American ', ' Fostering ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' tool ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Scientist ', ' South American ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' success ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer care ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' minority trainee ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' demographics ', ' health equity ', ' screening ', ' genetic make-up ', ' genetic makeup ', ' recruit teachers ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Student recruitment ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' minority scientist ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' translational cancer research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U54,2020,1141254,0.10242261202746027

All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos. Project Narrative The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at an ISUPS (FAMU), and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The proposed two full projects and pilot project include investigators from the three institutions and will leverage on specimens collected across the partnership from Blacks and Latinos, representing a wide range of subpopulations within these minority groups. Thus, our studies will reveal unprecedented findings about these two understudied minority populations. Importantly, these projects will be instrumental in transferring cutting edge and innovative technologies to FAMU, will provide research training opportunities across the partnership to 100 students, post-doctoral fellows, and early stage investigators, and will expand in a significant way the research focus at UF and USC-NCCC to address cancer health disparities in prostate and pancreas cancer.","2/3 Florida-California Cancer Research, Education and Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity Center",10006087,U54CA233444,"['Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Central American ', ' Fostering ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' tool ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Scientist ', ' South American ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' success ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer care ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' minority trainee ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' demographics ', ' health equity ', ' screening ', ' genetic make-up ', ' genetic makeup ', ' recruit teachers ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Student recruitment ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' minority scientist ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' translational cancer research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,U54,2020,1422598,0.10242261202746027
"Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO This application proposes an interdisciplinary Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO), with the unifying theme of conducting and promoting multi-level community-based participatory research to prevent SAVA syndemic conditions (substance abuse, violence/trauma and HIV/AIDS) and reduce their adverse health and mental health consequences. The emphasis of the Center will be on tailored interventions for Latino subgroups who represent pockets of vulnerability and require precise and specialized interventions that optimize access to and impact of interventions. CLaRO will unite and advance the work undertaken during the past decade by two NIMHD Centers of Excellence: the P60 Center of Excellence for Health Disparities Research (El Centro), at the University of Miami (UM), and the P20 Center of Excellence within the Center for Research on US Latino HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse (CRUSADA), at Florida International University (FIU). Both originating centers have well-established research infrastructures and strong records of achievement in translating research findings into meaningful, culturally relevant clinical practice for vulnerable Latinos. In this application, we propose two behavioral intervention studies, each of which advances the work of the existing collaborating Centers of Excellence. Research Project 1 will develop a culturally tailored intervention directed at preventing and reducing SAVA conditions among seasonal farmworker men and will be packaged, in collaboration with the Community/Scientific Advisory Board (CSAB), for community dissemination. Research Project 2 adapts and tests an intervention, developed at El Centro, for preventing and reducing self-harm and other SAVA-related behaviors in Latina and sexual/gender minority youth. The two Research Projects will be integrated through a common set of data points to measure risk and protective factors, moderators, and SAVA indicators related to the CLaRO theme. The common data elements will be expanded as CLaRO evolves to include biological and community-level measures. This application leverages the success of the originating Centers of Excellence and considerable institutional resources to advance investigator development at the applicant institution (UM). We propose a Pilot Projects Program, which will be articulated with scientific resources, training and mentorship, and will fund up to 35 studies, serving as an engine for the advancement of early-stage investigators and for diversifying the workforce of successful health disparities investigators. The CLaRO theme, agenda, and priorities were developed in collaboration with a network of community partners who will play an ongoing role in guiding and disseminating CLaRO science and advancing neighborhood capacity building and multilevel interventions to promote health in Latino communities. Miami-Dade County— with its large and diverse Latino population, who face individual, social and structural risk factors and have high prevalence of substance abuse, HIV and violence/trauma—provides the ideal laboratory for advancing the science of Latino health and health disparities. The proposed Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities: CLaRO, will conduct and promote research to advance interventions tailored for Latino groups who experience the greatest health risks, such as seasonal farmworkers, sexual/gender minority individuals and youth. The focus will be on community-based interventions that can have the greatest impact by addressing the root causes of the intertwined health conditions of substance abuse, violence/trauma, and HIV/AIDS. CLaRO will also contribute to the reduction and eventual elimination of health disparities by training, mentoring, and supporting the next generation of health disparities scientists. ",Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO,10178959,U54MD002266,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communities ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Family Research ', ' Florida ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' member ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' GEF5 ', ' P60 ', ' TIM1 ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Common Data Element ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' systems research ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' next generation ', ' Trauma ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' stem ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' service coordination ', ' protective factors ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,U54,2020,382071,0.09434028897458971
"Social disparities in physical functioning by race, ethnicity, and immigration status Project Summary / Abstract Although foreign-born Latinos have significantly higher life expectancy than non-Latino whites in the U.S., they are more likely to spend those additional years of life with a disability. Socioeconomic variations among race and ethnic groups cannot alone account for race/ethnic differences in disability. Previous research on the causes of these inequalities has primarily focused on explanations such as differential access to health care, early life conditions, environmental exposures, personal health behaviors, and stress. We investigate another potential mechanism: race and ethnic differences in work – i.e., the cumulative effects of physical and psychosocial conditions experienced as work throughout life. The US occupational structure is highly stratified by race/ethnicity and gender and extensive research on occupational health has demonstrated a strong relationship between physical and psychosocial work conditions and health outcomes. Our goal is to determine whether racial and ethnic differences in work conditions over the life course can account, in part, for significantly higher limitations in physical functioning among middle aged and older Latinos compared to whites. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and match employment histories from this survey with data on work conditions by occupational code for respondents' jobs from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). The analysis is based on growth curve and hazard models of limitations in physical functioning and mortality as a function of histories of work conditions and other variables. Reduced physical functioning can significantly diminish quality of life at older ages and greatly increase health care expenditures. Functional limitations are more common among social groups, including Latinos and particularly Latino immigrants, who have the fewest resources to cope with these limitations. The results of this study will significantly advance our knowledge of the role occupational segregation and work conditions in leading to higher rates of functional limitations among the Latino population. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to determine whether working in more demanding and stressful environments during adulthood decreases functional health at older ages and can explain the differences observed in older adult functional limitations by race, ethnicity, and immigration status. We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Employment histories from this survey will be matched with data on work conditions by occupational code for each job that respondents have held from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET).","Social disparities in physical functioning by race, ethnicity, and immigration status",9869833,R01AG061094,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Child Care ', ' Puericulture ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Health Expenditures ', ' health care expenditure ', ' healthcare expenditure ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Hazard Models ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Housekeeping ', ' Housework ', ' Immigration ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Information Networks ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Marmota ', ' Marmots ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' mortality ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Occupational Health ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' disability ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Physical Function ', ' Occupational ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social group ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Documentation ', ' Legal ', ' Data ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Outcome ', ' social disparities ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' health data ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' Social stratification ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2020,338063,0.017483463526376742
"Bridging Neglect: improved access to high-quality heart health information and care for communities at risk of Chagas disease Summary Chagas disease is a neglected disease that affects around 3,400 individuals in Massachusetts and around 300,000 in the United States. Infection with the Chagas parasite Trypanosoma cruzi can be transmitted vertically to the child in around 5% of pregnant mothers. Efforts to address Chagas disease are nearly non- existent in the U.S. Medical professionals and at-risk communities lack awareness of the disease, which leads to cardiac death in 20-30% of the infected. Latino communities at risk for Chagas disease also have low health literacy and have experienced less educational outreach regarding other heart health factors like obesity, diabetes and smoking prevention. We are building on the Strong Hearts project in East Boston, Massachusetts, that combines community outreach and education with facilitation of screening and referral for treatment of Chagas disease. Expertise in medical library science, clinical Infectious Disease and experience in Latino community outreach and education will synergize to optimize outreach using Latino communities’ favored social media. In-person, print, visual media and web-based knowledge provision will complement smartphone messaging, leveraging well-established community partnerships. Library sciences students will gain experience in providing medical information in optimally attractive forms, with an option of nationwide dissemination. Narrative Latino communities at risk for Chagas disease suffer from health disparities. We will leverage medical library science and clinical infectious disease expertise as well as experience in Latino community outreach to inform at-risk communities on this neglected disease.

"Tu Salud Si Cuenta!  Reaching Latino family dyads to increase physical activity and healthy eating Abstract(extracted from the parent grant, 1R01HL128705-01, 1R56HL128705-01) Most adults in the U.S. fail to meet national physical activity (PA) and dietary recommendations, and Latinos are less likely to meet these recommendations than non-Latino Whites. Physical inactivity, a poor diet, and obesity are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and stroke and are important contributors to preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Social environments are widely recognized to have an important impact on these behaviors, yet most behavior change programs give limited attention to the social contexts in which behaviors occur. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month, community-based family dyad intervention in promoting engagement in and maintenance of PA and healthy eating among Latino adults residing in three predominantly Latino communities in Houston, TX. Dyads will be randomly assigned to a community health worker (CHW)-led intervention, “Tu Salud, ¡Si Cuenta! – Familiar” (TSSC-Family) or to a contact control condition focused on healthy homes. TSSC-Family will consist of six home visits delivered to dyad members over a six-month period to build behavioral skills and social support for sustained healthy behavior change among Latino family dyads. The healthy homes contact control will also consist of six monthly visits delivered to dyad members by a CHW. Study participants will include 552 Latino adults not currently meeting PA or nutrition recommendations recruited and enrolled as family member dyads (n=276 dyads). This approach expands on an empirically- based motivational behavior change intervention developed by a member of the investigative team in collaboration with community partners that has shown preliminary evidence of effectiveness for positive PA and dietary behavior change in Latino individuals. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after baseline to evaluate both intermediate and long-term effects. Primary outcomes include minutes per week of moderate and vigorous PA, and servings of fruits and vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, and whole grains. Weight loss is a secondary outcome. Self-efficacy, stage of change, social support, and social control will also be examined as potential mediators of changes in PA and nutrition. The proposed research is innovative in its use of a novel intervention that emphasizes dyadic social processes in addition to standard behavior change strategies. The intervention explicitly targets family-based social networks to foster social environments supportive of healthy behavior change using CHWs to facilitate home-based outreach and communication to this understudied population. This research is expected to yield critical insight regarding effective approaches for increasing PA and healthy eating among Latinos, the largest and among the fastest growing minority groups in the U.S. Narrative (extracted from parent grant,1R01HL128705-01, 1R56HL128705-01) The proposed research seeks to address Latino health disparities in chronic disease risk by evaluating a novel intervention focused on motivation, behavior skills, and family social contexts to increase physical activity and healthy eating in Latino adults. The community-engaged research approach and the use of community health workers to deliver the intervention builds community capacity and enhances the potential to effectively address health disparities. Results will yield critical information regarding effective community-based intervention approaches and facilitate understanding of how this type of intervention can work in real-world settings.",Tu Salud Si Cuenta!

"Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community members Recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, including skin and respiratory irritation and asthma, as well as potential reproductive effects and breast cancer. Nonetheless, the production and distribution of these products continues to expand. In response public health actions have aimed to reduce exposures through substituting use of environmentally safer products in public buildings and schools and encouraging development of certified environmentally safer product labels. While these initiatives have been successful at reaching certain groups of workers and consumers, low wage domestic and other cleaning workers, who are disproportionately immigrant and Latino, have been largely left out due to factors including knowledge, awareness, cost and accessibility. The Safe and Just Cleaners Project aims to address this environmental health disparity by documenting and reducing exposures to cleaning agents among domestic cleaning workers in the Latino immigrant worker community in NYC, as part of a University- Community partnership. The rationale for this project is that once domestic cleaners, as part of a large and influential community-based organization, gain capacity and knowledge to recognize their exposures and potential risks as workers, this will lay the basis for building a joint worker-community effort that will simultaneously a) improve conditions for themselves as cleaning workers, and b) reduce exposure to hazardous cleaning agents in the larger community of which the workers are a part. Working collaboratively with the largest Latino immigrant community-based organization in NYC, with 30,000 members, the project will survey Latino domestic workers about their use, work practices, values, knowledge and attitudes about potential hazards and self-reported health problems associated with consumer cleaning product use. The project will then identify and quantitatively evaluate the exposure levels and conditions that result in inhalation and dermal exposures to volatile organic and quaternary ammonium compounds, two major and potentially toxic components of commercial cleaning agents, among Latino immigrant domestic cleaning workers. The project will measure exposures both at the time of cleaning as well as residual exposures that might continue to contaminate home environments even after cleaning tasks are complete. These findings will be used to develop and implement a multilevel strategic campaign to reduce exposures among immigrant communities through local and national partnerships. Embedding this campaign within a workers’ rights and social justice perspective provides an approach that educates people about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures. Although recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, important populations of users of the agents - low wage domestic cleaning workers who are mainly immigrant and Latino - have inadequate knowledge and limited access to safer alternatives, whether using these products at work or at home. The Safe and Just Cleaners/Limpieza Sana y Justa Project will document exposures to cleaning agents among the Latino immigrant domestic cleaners in NYC. Using a workers’ rights and social justice perspective, the project’s public health campaign will inform Latino domestic cleaners and their communities about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures.",Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community members,9830070,R01ES027890,"['Affect ', ' Air ', ' Ammonia ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' Community Workers ', ' Disinfectants ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Industrialization ', ' Influentials ', ' Irritants ', ' Joints ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Language ', ' New York ', ' Privatization ', ' Product Labeling ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Rights ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Schools ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Respiratory Signs and Symptoms ', ' airway symptom ', ' pulmonary symptom ', ' respiratory symptom ', ' Social Justice ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' skin irritation ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Residual ', ' Residual state ', ' Health Campaign ', ' Chemicals ', ' Training ', ' Dermal ', ' Policies ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Respondent ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' diaries ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' irritation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' respiratory ', ' Inhalation Exposure ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' quaternary ammonium compound ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' Chemical Exposure ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Allergic ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' reproductive ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Output ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' volatile organic chemical ', ' volatile organic compound ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' cognitive testing ', ' dermal exposure ', ' amateur science ', ' amateur scientists ', ' citizen scientists ', ' civic science ', ' crowd science ', ' crowd-sourced science ', ' scientific citizenship ', ' citizen science ', ' community partnership ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NIEHS,QUEENS COLLEGE,R01,2020,690266,0.03774989348207236
"Understanding disparities in alcohol treatment services utilization PROJECT SUMMARY: Understanding disparities in alcohol treatment services utilization Introduction: Despite their high need for treatment, Latinos greatly underutilize specialty alcohol treatment. Evidence suggests that Latinos are less likely to use specialty alcohol treatment than other racial/ethnic groups, with the greatest disparity being between Latinos and Whites. Underutilization of specialty treatment is particularly pronounced among Latina women and Latinos low in acculturation. Researchers have suggested that Latinos may experience more barriers to accessing specialty treatment than other racial/ethnic groups. However, studies examining treatment barriers by race/ethnicity are scant, are inconclusive, and face multiple methodological limitations. Aims: In Aim 1, we seek to validate a newly developed, theoretically informed, measure that will sensitively capture key barriers to explain Latino-White disparities in the use of specialty alcohol treatment. In Aim 2, we seek to determine which treatment barriers are most significant to Latinos (vs. Whites). Aim 3 will compare treatment barriers among Latinos only to better understand gender and acculturation disparities. Design and Methods: The proposed study will consist of two phases. In Phase I, we will recruit 40 White and Latino participants with recent (i.e., past-5-year) alcohol use disorders (AUD) for cognitive interviews to further refine our novel, theory-driven scale: The Barriers to Specialty Alcohol Treatment Scale (BSAT). The BSAT was informed by findings from a recently completed pilot study and the Theory of Planned Behavior. Barriers are measured using a 5-point Likert scale response. Data from these interviews will inform the refinement, deletion, and creation of items, resulting in a finalized BSAT scale. In Phase II, we will recruit a national sample of 1,200 White and Latino participants with recent AUD to complete a structured questionnaire that will include the BSAT, resulting from Phase I. Measures of alcohol use disorders, drug use disorders, problem severity, mental health status, acculturation, and socio-demographics will also be collected. These data will be used to conduct psychometric testing for scale validation (Aim 1). We will also conduct separate linear regression models analyzing each barrier as an outcome, while controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and potential confounders, to (a) test for Latino-White differences (Aim 2) and (b) gender and acculturation differences (among Latinos-only; Aim 3). Participants in both phases will be recruited via web panels, a cost- effective approach to effectively sample our target population. Impact: The proposed study is significant because it will uncover new knowledge that is critical to the development of effective and culturally tailored intervention strategies that meet the specific needs of Latinos with AUD and can reduce existing racial/ethnic health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE This alcohol treatment services utilization study is focused on understanding barriers that contribute to Latino- White disparities in the use of specialty alcohol treatment. Underutilization of specialty alcohol treatment by Latinos, the largest and fastest growing minority racial/ethnic group, is troublesome given that these services have been shown to be effective regardless of race/ethnicity. Findings will address gaps in our understanding of barriers that prevent people from seeking and receiving appropriate care for alcohol use disorders and will aid in the development of strategies to enhance treatment use.",Understanding disparities in alcohol treatment services utilization,10006787,R01AA027767,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Attitude ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Drug Use Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Goals ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' parity ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Rehabilitation therapy ', ' Medical Rehabilitation ', ' Rehabilitation ', ' rehab therapy ', ' rehabilitative ', ' rehabilitative therapy ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' problem drinking ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Policies ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' Reporting ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' care services ', ' care systems ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' service utilization ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' family support ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' treatment services ', ' cognitive interview ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' compare treatment ', ' treatment comparison ', ' ']",NIAAA,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2020,353641,0.041396395699217325
"Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE) ABSTRACT The goal of STRIDE (Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment) is to develop, test, and disseminate an integrated multi-level, culturally sensitive intervention to engage African Americans and Latinos in translational research. STRIDE is a partnership of the CTSAs at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and Vanderbilt University, three geographically diverse areas with large numbers of African American and Latino constituents. Despite disparities in leading causes of death, morbidity and disability, African Americans and Latinos are under-represented in important translational research studies that have potential to reduce these disparities. Our team's prior work suggests that limited research literacy, defined as “the capacity to obtain, process and understand basic information needed to make informed decisions about research participation,” often precludes research participation. Participant barriers also include lack of trust stemming from historical abuses. Research team members often lack skills in cultural competency and may not be sensitive to important issues faced by populations of color. Likewise, informed consent procedures contained within the research system may create confusion and disengagement of diverse participants. The multilevel STRIDE intervention will address these barriers at three levels: patient, research team, and system. The STRIDE intervention builds from synergistic work conducted at the three participating CTSA hubs that includes patient, research staff and systems (e-Consent) targeted interventions. Collectively, our approach will enable research personnel to recruit and deliver informed consent in a culturally competent, literacy appropriate manner, while also improving the “research literacy” of potential research participants. The participant component of the STRIDE intervention will draw upon the power of narrative intervention, or “storytelling,” by harnessing powerful stories from actual research participants describing their experiences, which will be incorporated in community-based outreach forums, the e-consent platform and in clinical settings. The research team component of the STRIDE intervention centers on an innovative application of medical simulation to improve the cultural competency of those recruiting and enrolling diverse participants in translational research. The systems component of the STRIDE intervention will be based on an innovative REDCap e-Consent platform adapted for cultural sensitivity to African American and Latinos and incorporates access to ancillary tools to enhance patient understanding. The project has three Specific Aims that correspond to three study phases. In Aim 1, the comprehensive intervention will be developed and pilot tested. In Aim 2, a multi-site interrupted time series design trial will be conducted to determine the impact of the STRIDE intervention on recruitment of African American and Latino participants in ongoing clinical trials. In Aim 3, dissemination activities will be conducted throughout the CTSA network and beyond. PROJECT NARRATIVE African Americans and Latinos are not adequately represented in translational research, particularly given the widespread health disparities experienced by these groups. This study aims to develop, test and make widely available a multi-level intervention that is culturally and literacy appropriate to address this critical issue.",Strengthening Translational Research in Diverse Enrollment (STRIDE),9975248,U01TR001812,"['Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Anxiety ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Confusion ', ' Confusional State ', ' Mental Confusion ', ' Critiques ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Environment ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Informed Consent ', ' Learning ', ' literacy ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' pressure ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Standardization ', ' Tablets ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' role model ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Trust ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Cooperative Learning ', ' Experiential Learning ', ' Active Learning ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' tool ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Complex ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' outreach ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' Emotional ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' International ', ' Interruption ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Study Section ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' health literacy ', ' systems research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community organizations ', ' stem ', ' translational clinical trial ', ' primary outcome ', ' trial design ', ' Research Assistant ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NCATS,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2020,995729,0.04213946715503119
"Linking Community and Family Characteristics to Adolescent Adjustment Latino youth in immigrant families are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. school population and face elevated risks of externalizing and internalizing problems and barriers to social and academic competence. Compromised adolescent adjustment harms youth and adult health and promotes inter-generational transmissions of inequality. Parenting processes are strong, malleable correlates of Latino youth adjustment. A glaring weakness in Latino parenting research is inadequate attention to extra-familial cultural demands and opportunities. These demands and opportunities include language use and co-ethnic concentration in neighborhoods; discrimination and support in school and peer contexts; Latino student concentration in schools; peer bullying victimization; and immigrant experiences tied to documentation status, discrimination, migration, and transnationalism. Gaps in research are pronounced for new immigrant destinations, where a lack of established co-ethnic enclaves and language barriers pose unique challenges for Latino families adjusting to life in the U.S. The main goal of this application is to specify the cascade of effects from extra-familial cultural demands and opportunities to Latino adolescent adjustment in an emerging immigrant area. Using culturally informed theory, multi-level data, and multiple mediator models, this research will test the hypothesis that Latino cultural inclusion and support in neighborhood, school, peer and immigrant contexts will lead to declines in youth's externalizing and internalizing problems and increases in youth's social and academic competence during adolescence. The study's mediating hypothesis is that Latino cultural inclusion and support external to the family will influence youth outcomes indirectly by reducing acculturation-related stress (immigrant stressors such as deportation fears, social isolation, and language barriers; parent-child acculturation gaps; demands on youth language brokering) and, in turn, increasing effective parenting (supportive parenting, parental monitoring, family cohesion, low conflict). Effective parenting is hypothesized to be associated reciprocally with adolescents' positive adjustment. Tests of moderated mediation will examine variations in pathways to youth outcomes by adolescents' gender, age, length of U.S. residence, and transition to high school. Using an intentionally missing data design, this study will have 8 time points of data spanning 6th to 11th grade for 600 Latino parent-youth dyads representative of Latinos in a suburban Atlanta school district. The PI's research and partnerships with the school district strengthen feasibility for the proposed study. Data will be analyzed using multilevel, structural equation modeling. In a key departure from individual- and family-level studies, this study will use an integrated theoretical model of culturally relevant extra-familial factors salient to acculturation stressors, parenting, and Latino adolescent adjustment. Results will identify the timing and targets of culture-specific policies and programs enhancing family interventions in new immigrant areas. As one-third of K-12 U.S. students will be Latino in less than a decade, results will inform efforts to reduce the public health burden of poor adjustment among the U.S. school population. Increases in the U.S. Latino population, rapid growth in new immigrant areas, and current policy debates around immigration underscore the timely need for this research. PROJECT NARRATIVE This study will assess how cultural demands and opportunities in neighborhood, school, peer and immigrant contexts influence acculturation-related stressors and, in turn, parenting processes and adolescents' externalizing and internalizing problems and social and academic competence. Study activities include the collection and analysis of eight time points of survey data over a period of four years for a school-based sample of adolescents (n = 600) and, for a random 50% of participating youth, their mothers (n = 300) in an emerging immigrant destination in suburban Atlanta. Findings will identify the timing and targets of culture-specific policies, programs, and community cultural supports that can enhance existing family-based interventions for Latino youth, the fastest growing segment of the U.S. school population.",Linking Community and Family Characteristics to Adolescent Adjustment,9925658,R01HD090232,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Attention ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Immigration ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Mothers ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Destinations ', ' Gender ', ' Competence ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' suburban ', ' suburbia ', ' suburb ', ' Area ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' teacher ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Glare ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Victimization ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Country ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohesion ', ' intergenerational ', ' high school ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' Exclusion ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' 11th grade ', ' high school junior ', ' eleventh grade ', ' social ', ' parent monitoring ', ' parental monitoring ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Collection ', ' Monitor ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' To specify ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' rapid growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' marginalization ', ' social exclusion ', ' school district ', ' K-12 student ', ' ']",NICHD,GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,525395,0.0634971726675798
"Promoting health by understanding risk and protective factors for substance use among Latino youth in rural and small town communities in the United States Abstract The demographic composition of small towns and rural communities in the U.S. has changed dramatically, in part because of the large in-migration of Latino families. For communities to support the health of their members, they must be able to reinforce factors that promote positive youth development (protective factors) and abate factors that hinder it (risk factors). However, much of what is known about risk and resilience comes from research on urban communities. There has been little longitudinal research on Latinos growing up in the rural U.S., and none with sufficient data to understand the etiology of substance use (SU), patterns of health disparities in SU, and factors influencing their health and wellbeing as young adults. We know little about the intersectionality of Latino ethnicity, immigrant status, and rural context and how these relate to the developmental mechanisms of health disparities. This knowledge gap limits prevention and intervention services, as the prevention science paradigm depends on accurately identifying risk and protective factors (RPFs) and developing prevention programs targeting these factors to reduce problem behaviors. The present application capitalizes on existing rich longitudinal data spanning childhood through early adulthood to examine influences on health and well-being of rural Latino youth. Using this existing data, we will examine health disparities in substance use and associated RPFs (a) between 3rd-generation rural Latino and non-Latino White youth, and (b) among rural Latino youth who are 1st-, 2nd- or 3rd-generation immigrants (i.e., children of immigrant or U.S.-born parents). In the supplemental analyses used for triangulation and validation, we will use national cross-sectional data and examine differences in the association between RPFs and alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drug use for Latino youth by the type of residence (rural vs. small and large metro areas) at the historical time points and age ranges corresponding to the longitudinal study. Findings will provide rigorous scientific evidence regarding risk and protective processes for Latino youth in rural areas of the U.S. that may lead to prevention efforts to reduce health disparities in substance use and other health risk behaviors in young adulthood, and potentially reduce disparities in serious illness later in the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This study aims to examine health disparities in substance use and factors influencing the health and well- being of Latino youth residing in rural and small-town communities of the United States, a growing but understudied and underserved population. Findings from the proposed project will provide much needed empirical evidence about risk and protective processes in the etiology of substance use among Latino youth in rural areas of the U.S., and inform the planning, selection, and implementation of prevention programs that will reduce health disparities and improve the health and well-being of vulnerable populations.",Promoting health by understanding risk and protective factors for substance use among Latino youth in rural and small town communities in the United States,9969845,R01DA048827,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Federal Government ', ' National Government ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Local Government ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Social Change ', ' Social modification ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social Development ', ' State Government ', ' Provincial Government ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Generations ', ' Latino ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Rural Community ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' positive youth development ', ' Sampling ', ' Abate ', ' model development ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' service intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' Communities That Care ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2020,236077,0.01678974337686763
"Impact of the Therapeutic Alliance on Reduction of Disparities in Latino End-of-Life Cancer Care PROJECT SUMMARY This proposal aims to develop and pilot test a theoretically-grounded, behavioral intervention to promote the development of a therapeutic alliance between oncologists and Latino advanced cancer patients. This intervention will be grounded in the theoretical model of the TA and a conceptual model of the TA in Latino cancer patients that we will develop through the proposed formative research. Based on data from the literature and our preliminary studies, this intervention will seek to improve oncologist TA by promoting trust, empathy, shared decision-making, and patient-centered communication. The intervention framework will be based on Self Determination Theory (SDT), which posits that behaviour change (improvement in TA) is more likely when conditions of autonomy, competence, and relatedness are met. First, mixed methods will be used to create a conceptual model of the TA between oncologists and Latino cancer patients to determine targets for the intervention (Fig 1). Aim1a will leverage data from an ongoing funded multi-site, prospective observational R01 on medical/religious/cultural beliefs, TA, and EOL care outcomes (n>270). For Aim 1b, we will conduct in-depth interviews and focus groups with oncologists (n=9) and Latino cancer patients (n=35) in order to gain a more nuanced understanding of the TA and refine our conceptual model. Once the intervention has been created, we will then refine the intervention using stakeholder (Aim 1b participants) feedback regarding its feasibility and acceptability. For Aim 3, an independent set of 8 oncologists and 50 patients will be studied, half (n=4 oncologists, 25 patients) will be randomized to training in the TA intervention, and the other half (n=4, 25) will be randomized in to usual care. We will examine feasibility (rate of intervention completion), acceptability (oncologists’ and patients’ satisfaction), and efficacy of the TA intervention for improving the TA between oncologists and Latino cancer patients, as measured by patient THC scores as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes will include engagement in ACP and EOL care. Dr. Tergas’s long-term career goal is to establish a leading, independent program of research focused on the reduction of disparities in EOL care by implementing and disseminating effective, empirically-supported interventions for use in clinical practice. As a foundation for her independent research program, her short-term career goal is to develop an implementable, evidence-based behavioral intervention for improving therapeutic alliance between oncologists and Latino cancer patients. This K08 award application represents the cornerstone of her strategy to achieve my short- term goal and consists of cohesive and complementary research aims and training objectives. Specifically, in order to achieve her career goals, she needs training in intervention development and implementation science, as well as continued training and mentorship in EOL care disparities. Conducting the research detailed in my research aims will help me achieve this training and experience, as well as provide preliminary data for a future R01-level grant application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cancer is the leading cause of death among Latinos in the US, who now represent the largest minority group. Latino cancer patients engage in advance care planning less often and receive less value-consistent care at the end-of-life more often than non-Latino cancer patients.

"Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO This application proposes an interdisciplinary Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities (CLaRO), with the unifying theme of conducting and promoting multi-level community-based participatory research to prevent SAVA syndemic conditions (substance abuse, violence/trauma and HIV/AIDS) and reduce their adverse health and mental health consequences. The emphasis of the Center will be on tailored interventions for Latino subgroups who represent pockets of vulnerability and require precise and specialized interventions that optimize access to and impact of interventions. CLaRO will unite and advance the work undertaken during the past decade by two NIMHD Centers of Excellence: the P60 Center of Excellence for Health Disparities Research (El Centro), at the University of Miami (UM), and the P20 Center of Excellence within the Center for Research on US Latino HIV/AIDS and Drug Abuse (CRUSADA), at Florida International University (FIU). Both originating centers have well-established research infrastructures and strong records of achievement in translating research findings into meaningful, culturally relevant clinical practice for vulnerable Latinos. In this application, we propose two behavioral intervention studies, each of which advances the work of the existing collaborating Centers of Excellence. Research Project 1 will develop a culturally tailored intervention directed at preventing and reducing SAVA conditions among seasonal farmworker men and will be packaged, in collaboration with the Community/Scientific Advisory Board (CSAB), for community dissemination. Research Project 2 adapts and tests an intervention, developed at El Centro, for preventing and reducing self-harm and other SAVA-related behaviors in Latina and sexual/gender minority youth. The two Research Projects will be integrated through a common set of data points to measure risk and protective factors, moderators, and SAVA indicators related to the CLaRO theme. The common data elements will be expanded as CLaRO evolves to include biological and community-level measures. This application leverages the success of the originating Centers of Excellence and considerable institutional resources to advance investigator development at the applicant institution (UM). We propose a Pilot Projects Program, which will be articulated with scientific resources, training and mentorship, and will fund up to 35 studies, serving as an engine for the advancement of early-stage investigators and for diversifying the workforce of successful health disparities investigators. The CLaRO theme, agenda, and priorities were developed in collaboration with a network of community partners who will play an ongoing role in guiding and disseminating CLaRO science and advancing neighborhood capacity building and multilevel interventions to promote health in Latino communities. Miami-Dade County— with its large and diverse Latino population, who face individual, social and structural risk factors and have high prevalence of substance abuse, HIV and violence/trauma—provides the ideal laboratory for advancing the science of Latino health and health disparities. The proposed Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities: CLaRO, will conduct and promote research to advance interventions tailored for Latino groups who experience the greatest health risks, such as seasonal farmworkers, sexual/gender minority individuals and youth. The focus will be on community-based interventions that can have the greatest impact by addressing the root causes of the intertwined health conditions of substance abuse, violence/trauma, and HIV/AIDS. CLaRO will also contribute to the reduction and eventual elimination of health disparities by training, mentoring, and supporting the next generation of health disparities scientists. ",Center for Latino Health Research Opportunities-CLaRO,9889812,U54MD002266,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Communities ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Family Research ', ' Florida ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Leadership ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Privatization ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Community Networks ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' member ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' ARHGEF5 ', ' GEF5 ', ' P60 ', ' TIM1 ', ' ARHGEF5 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Common Data Element ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' systems research ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' next generation ', ' Trauma ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' stem ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' clinical practice ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' service coordination ', ' protective factors ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,U54,2020,1327626,0.09434028897458971
"Tailoring of Childhood Obesity Screening and Counseling for Latino Families with Preschool-Aged Children ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a revised application for a K23 award for a fellowship trained pediatrician specializing in Pediatric Nutrition and childhood obesity. The candidate is committed to an academic career as a physician scientist conducting patient-oriented research in childhood obesity. This award will support the candidate's training and attainment of expertise in three areas: qualitative research methods, cultural tailoring of technology-based interventions, and implementation science. This training will support his overall goals of designing and rigorously testing childhood obesity interventions that can be readily translated and disseminated and that will provide critical insight for care in diverse settings and patient groups. To achieve these goals, Dr. Haemer has assembled a cross-disciplinary mentoring team, each with outstanding experience in research methods and strong records of successful mentoring: Dr. Glasgow, a behavioral scientist who is renown within the field of implementation science; Dr. Bull, an expert researcher in technology-based health promotion; and Dr. Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition specialist with extensive research and clinical experience in childhood obesity and with a long history of mentoring young investigators. The proposed research addresses the huge knowledge gap in cost-effective ways for the healthcare system to influence both patient-level and population-level outcomes for childhood obesity. Evidence-based approaches of surveillance, screening, prevention and treatment largely remain uncertain or untested, especially for the youngest children from groups at highest risk of obesity-related health disparity. This K23 award will study methods for prevention and treatment applied to Latino preschool-aged children from low- income families. The research will test the central hypothesis that culturally tailored screening and counseling will be more effective at decreasing BMI trajectory than usual care. Specific aims include: 1. To characterize components of primary care interactions that should be culturally tailored to enhance motivation for healthy lifestyle change among Latino parents with preschoolers 2. To design a technology-user interface that maximizes acceptance by Latino parents of young children. 3. To pilot test a technology-supported screening and counseling protocol tailored to Latino parents using findings of Aims 1 and 2. Using an implementation science perspective, we will assess the reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation fidelity, and sustainable maintenance of the intervention in clinical practice during the pilot RCT. This research and training will form the basis for an RO1 proposal to test technology-supported childhood obesity prevention and treatment interventions targeting young children from low-income Latino families. OMB No. 0925-0001/0002 (Rev. 08/12 Approved Through 8/31/2015) Page Continuation Format Page PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    By studying how technology can support behavioral interventions for childhood obesity within primary care settings serving high-risk minority populations, we have the potential to deliver cost-effectiveness of obesity interventions with broad reach.

"Fit 5 Kids Screen Time Reduction Curriculum for Latino Preschoolers: A RCT ABSTRACT  Screen time is a major risk factor for childhood obesity and inadequate physical activity, both of which are determinants of type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease, and multiple cancers. Latinos are the largest and fastest growing minority in the US. Because US Latino children have more screen time and higher rates of obesity than their non-Latino White peers, interventions to reduce screen time adapted for Latino preschoolers are necessary to reduce health inequities related to obesity and T2D in the US. However, a systematic review reported no successful screen time reduction interventions among Latino preschoolers.  Our team's pilot study tested the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids screen time reduction curriculum among Latino preschoolers in Head Start. This short term cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the only successful screen time reduction program for Latino preschoolers, having significantly reduced screen time by over 25 minutes/day. Our culturally adapted, multi-level intervention consists of lessons taught by study staff directly to preschoolers during Head Start, a weekly parent newsletter, child-tailored goal setting with parents, a lending library (books, games, arts/crafts, etc.) and parenting tips via text messages several times/week. We will use a social ecological model and consider multiple levels of influences for analyses: (1) individual-level influences, e.g., acculturation and social cognitive theory, (2) families, e.g., screen time parenting practices, (3) schools, and (4) macro-environmental influences, e.g., neighborhood disorder. Building on this pilot work, we propose a long term, efficacy, cluster RCT of the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids among Latino preschoolers in Head Start from three US settings: Seattle, Houston, and the rural Central Valley of Washington State. Among 280 Latino 3-5 year olds at 20 Head Start centers, our Specific Aims (SA) and Hypotheses (H) include: SA1) To conduct a cluster RCT of the culturally adapted Fit 5 Kids curriculum to evaluate its efficacy in reducing screen time and excessive weight gain over a school year (8-months)  H1) Fit 5 Kids will decrease children's screen time (primary outcome), BMI z-scores and dietary energy intake, and increase MVPA compared to controls SA2) To examine mediators and moderators associated with reducing Latino preschoolers' screen time  H2) Parents' outcome expectations, self-efficacy, and screen time parenting practices will mediate the relationship between Fit 5 Kids and changes to preschoolers' screen time  H3) Parents' depressive symptoms, stress, and social support will moderate changes to child screen time  The proposed Fit 5 Kids cluster RCT will confirm the pilot's promising results, and the larger sample will allow for mediation analyses to better understand mechanisms. This research will provide justification for a future community effectiveness trial with implementation by Head Start teachers, and the eventual widespread dissemination of Fit 5 Kids in Head Start centers nationally. PROJECT NARRATIVE Childhood obesity and metabolic risk are at record high levels in the US, and Latino children are at very high risk. This project will test an intervention called Fit 5 Kids, designed for Latino preschoolers to decrease their screen time in order to promote physical activity and healthy eating, and to prevent obesity. Ultimately, this line of research has the potential to provide an effective program to reduce risk of obesity for Latinos in the Head Start program and other preschool-based settings.",Fit 5 Kids Screen Time Reduction Curriculum for Latino Preschoolers: A RCT,9853777,R01DK113005,"['Academy ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Books ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Libraries ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Newsletter ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Parents ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Television ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Washington ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Site ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' teacher ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' awake ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Sample Size ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Metabolic ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Head Start ', ' Head Start Program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' expectation ', ' peer ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' dietary excess ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' systematic review ', ' child adiposity ', ' child obesity ', ' childhood adiposity ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obese children ', ' obesity during childhood ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' pilot trial ', ' obesity prevention ', ' screen time ', ' television watching ', ' tv watching ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' 5 years of age ', ' age 5 years ', ' five year old ', ' five years of age ', ' 5 year old ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' community safety ', ' neighborhood safety ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' physical activity intervention ', ' exercise intervention ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adults with obesity ', ' adult obesity ', ' health goals ', ' ']",NIDDK,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2020,625381,0.16754694788435862
"Culturally relevant contributors to cognitive and MRI changes in older Latinos PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Latinos are one of the fastest growing minority populations in the US, and they are 1.5 times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s dementia as older non-Latino Whites. Culturally relevant factors such as acculturation, the process by which Latinos adapt to the US and potentially adopt its values and practices, may contribute to health disparities in brain aging and Alzheimer’s dementia in Latinos. While levels of acculturation have been linked to a number of health outcomes in Latinos, less work has been done in cognition and brain aging. Newer theories of acculturation suggest it is not a static, linear process but a dynamic exchange between Latinos and other members of society that emerges from and is reinforced by broader socioenvironmental determinants vital to a process now called ‘acculturation in context’ (AIC). Thus, in addition to traditional acculturation factors (e.g., language preference and/or years in the US), individual-level (e.g., perceived discrimination, family and/or cultural stressors) and neighborhood-level (e.g., crime rates) socioenvironmental determinants need to be integrated into research in older Latinos. We will incorporate advances in geospatial informatics to quantify neighborhood-level determinants of AIC, longitudinal multi-modal neuroimaging, and the digital capture of behavior in a well-characterized cohort of Latinos 60 years and older for the most comprehensive study of AIC as it relates to brain aging in Latinos. By 2030, the Latino population 65 and older will increase by ~225% compared to a 65% increase in non-Latino Whites; rates for Alzheimer’s dementias will also disproportionately increase for older Latinos. This R01, with its focus on AIC and brain aging in Latinos, may provide a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons for this disproportionate increase.  To achieve the overall goal of the study – to investigate the relationship of AIC to changes in cognition and brain MRI indices in older Latinos and determine whether these factors affect the well-documented relationships between other risk factors and changes in cognition or brain MRI indices – we will conduct a comprehensive assessment of the AIC framework including the geocoding of neighborhood factors, repeat multi-modal MRI, and the digital capture of behavior in 350 older Latinos. We will leverage the infrastructure of two cohort studies at the Rush Alzheimer’s Disease Center to incorporate ongoing longitudinal data acquisition of cognition and other risk factors into this R01. When combined, this information will allow us to examine the relationship of AIC to change in cognition (Aim 1) and brain MRI indices (Aim 2) in older Latinos, and determine if levels of AIC modify the relationship of cardiovascular disease risk factor profiles to changes in cognition or brain MRI indices in this same population (Aim 3). Given that rates of Alzheimer’s dementia are disproportionately increasing for Latinos in the US, understanding modifiable contributors to this health disparity that may be specific to this population is critical. PROJECT NARRATIVE By 2030, Latinos, one of the fastest growing minority populations in the US at risk for Alzheimer’s dementia, may see as much as an 832% increase in individuals living with Alzheimer’s dementia. While this health disparity may arise from multiple factors, less work has been done investigating culturally relevant information about the Latino experience in the US in studies of Latino brain aging. Applying the newly expanded theory of ‘acculturation in context’ that combines traditional acculturation factors (e.g., language preference and/or years in the US) with individual-level (e.g., perceived discrimination, family and/or cultural stressors) and neighborhood-level (e.g., crime rates) socioenvironmental determinants, this R01 will investigate changes in cognition and brain aging in older Latinos for the most comprehensive investigation of aging in Latinos to date.",Culturally relevant contributors to cognitive and MRI changes in older Latinos,9884442,R01AG062711,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Crime ', ' Demyelinations ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' indexing ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' MR Imaging ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MRI ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Public Health ', ' Reaction Time ', ' Response RT ', ' Response Time ', ' psychomotor reaction time ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Societies ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Fe element ', ' Iron ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adopted ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' member ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' cognitive change ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Motor ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' digital ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' data acquisition ', ' aged brain ', ' aging brain ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' multi-modality ', ' multimodality ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' Infrastructure ', ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' ']",NIA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2020,780398,0.08029834255648213
"Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Preschoolers: An Evidence Based Procedure Abstract Bilingual children are often misdiagnosed as having a speech disorder when they truly exhibit normal development. In addition, speech-language pathologists (SLP) are avoiding the assessment of bilingual children due to the lack of knowledge and resources necessary for best practice with this population. Misdiagnosis of speech sound disorders in this population has long-term emotional, financial, and educational costs. Misdiagnosis of speech disorders in bilingual children can be prevented if we acquire more information on what constitutes normal and disordered speech development in the bilingual population. The current research is designed to validate a model of speech sound production in bilinguals to frame a screening tool for Latino preschoolers. Due to differences in speech production found in bilingual preschoolers (Fabiano-Smith & Goldstein, 2010a; 2010b; Fabiano-Smith & Barlow, 2010), an assessment procedure that evaluates the speech of bilingual preschoolers that takes into account both English and Spanish is necessary to prevent misdiagnosis of speech sound disorders. The Specific Aims of the proposed research are to (1) to validate our model of speech sound production in bilinguals, the PRIMIR 2 model and (2) to improve the existing version of the assessment procedure utilized in Phase 1 of our research using Item Response and Classical Test Theory approaches to reliability. Bilingual children with typical and disordered development will be compared to their English-speaking peers on measures of speech sound ability. Children will produce sounds in single words and their productions will be phonetically transcribed. Child productions will be examined, in both English and Spanish and across both languages, on common diagnostic measures used for monolingual children. Mixed effects regression models will be used to identify between-language interaction in bilingual speech and the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) will be used to determine sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic measures examined. Item Response Theory (IRT) will be used to identify a set of test items that are sensitive and specific to bilingual children with suspected speech sound disorders. Findings will lead to a characterization of typical and disordered speech sound development in bilingual children and diagnostic guidelines for speech-language pathologists to use in the differential diagnosis of speech difference from speech disorder. These findings will reduce diagnostic error in the identification of speech sound disorders in this population, reducing health disparities for Latino children. Latinos are the most populous minority group in the United States and children are the largest segment of the Latino population, comprising the majority of all children in some states (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010b, 2010c). This research will address a large and growing need: Reducing health disparities between Latinos and other racial and ethnic groups. The outcomes of this study will serve to impact (1) the lives of Latino children and their families by limiting the number of children misdiagnosed with speech sound disorders in the United States and (2) speech-language pathologists who are struggling to assess and diagnose the growing number of bilingual children on their caseloads.",Assessment of Speech Sound Disorders in Latino Preschoolers: An Evidence Based Procedure,9994977,R01DC016624,"['Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Differential Diagnosis ', ' Diagnostic Errors ', ' diagnosis errors ', ' Discriminant Analysis ', ' Discriminant Analyses ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Infant ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Language ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Production ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' ROC Curve ', ' ROC Analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic analyses ', ' receiver operating characteristic curve ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Speech Disorders ', ' Speech Manifestations ', ' Speech Perception ', ' Speech Sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Walking ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' screening tools ', ' Screening procedure ', ' wasting ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Pathologist ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Outcome Study ', ' American ', ' phonology ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Speech Development ', ' theories ', ' kindergarten ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Diagnostic Sensitivity ', ' Diagnostic Specificity ', ' Clinical Evaluation ', ' Clinical Testing ', ' clinical test ', ' research clinical testing ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' R21 Program ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' evidence base ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' ']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2020,585010,0.0568552401145703
"Adaptation and Pilot Feasibility of a Psychotherapy Intervention for Latinos with Advanced Cancer PROJECT SUMMARY Latinos are at higher risk of poorer psychological and quality of life outcomes when compared to non-Hispanic white patients and other minority patients and commonly report using spiritual strategies to cope with cancer. Maintaining hope, spiritual well-being and finding meaning in the cancer experience is critical for the adjustment and well-being of advanced cancer patients. However, there are no targeted psychosocial or psychotherapeutic interventions available for Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer. Meaning-Centered psychotherapy (MCP) is a novel psychotherapeutic intervention designed to help patients with advanced cancer sustain or enhance a sense of meaning, peace and purpose as they approach the end-of-life. The objective of this study is to culturally adapt and pilot Meaning-Centered Psychotherapy with Spanish-speaking Latinos (MCP-L) diagnosed with advanced cancer. The first aim of this study is to translate and culturally adapt the Meaning Centered Psychotherapy intervention manual guided by the Ecological Validity Framework, based on our previous formative research and with information gathered by interviewing 15 key informants and a pre- pilot of key sections of MCP-L with 10 Spanish-speaking Latinos patients. The second aim is to determine its feasibility and acceptability, and to generate preliminary data on impact (improvement of spiritual well-being, quality of life and reduction of depression, anxiety, and hopelessness) of the culturally adapted version of MCP- L by conducting a randomized controlled pilot trial. My long-term goal is to become an independent clinical researcher and an expert in the cultural adaptation field of psychotherapeutic and psychosocial interventions with minority cancer patients. This application will allow me to acquire the training and mentored research experience and obtain additional training in: (1) Transcreation and cultural adaptation of interventions; (2) Psychotherapy theory research and process research, (3) Mixed methods approaches, (4) Design, implementation and evaluation of randomized controlled trials with Latino patients, and (5) Dissemination and implementation science. I am proposing a mix of guided mentoring, didactic training, coursework, webinars, seminars and tutorials, directed readings, conferences, and hands-on research activities that will facilitate the development of research skills and enable me to gain experience in these areas. This proposal is responsive to the priorities of the NCI Strategic Plan, to study and identify factors contributing to disparities, develop culturally appropriate approaches, and disseminate interventions to overcome health disparities across the cancer control continuum from disease prevention to end-of-life care. The research agenda will allow me to acquire the research skills to become a successful independent investigator in the important field of cultural adaptation of psychosocial interventions for ethnic minority cancer patients. The study findings will be used to submit a competitive NIH R01 application to conduct a large randomized controlled trial of Meaning Centered Psychotherapy with Spanish-speaking patients diagnosed with advanced cancer. PROJECT NARRATIVE PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study is relevant to public health because it addresses the critical lack of palliative cancer care interventions for the Spanish-speaking population. NCI recognizes that minorities and other underserved populations bear a far greater cancer burden than the general population. NCI aims to overcome cancer disparities by promoting research to understand the underlying causes and contributing factors of cancer treatment and survival disparities, and by accelerating the dissemination and implementation of interventions to address cancer health disparities. Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer are at risk for poor mental health outcomes. This will be the first psychotherapeutic intervention adapted for Spanish-speaking Latinos diagnosed with advanced cancer.",Adaptation and Pilot Feasibility of a Psychotherapy Intervention for Latinos with Advanced Cancer,9994256,K08CA234397,"['Adoption ', ' Anxiety ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae ', ' bear ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Incidence ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' literacy ', ' Manuals ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Health Services ', ' Mental Hygiene Services ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Probability ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Psychiatric Social Work ', ' Psychiatric Social Service ', ' psychosocial service ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' waitlist ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Latino ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' No hope for the future ', ' hopelessness ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' Intention ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Research Activity ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' Funding ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' skills ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' peace ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' end of life care ', ' theories ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' cancer palliative care ', ' cancer palliative treatment ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' pilot trial ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' implementation science ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' arm ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' webinar ', ' hands on research ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' cancer survival ', ' ']",NCI,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,K08,2020,180311,0.0956070423853728
"Enhanced Primary Care Nutrition and Screen time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Primary Care Based Feeding and Screen Time Education to Prevent Obesity in Latino Infants Latino children experience higher rates of obesity than non-Hispanic white children, a disparity that emerges in infancy. Among Latino children, those with Spanish-speaking parents are at highest risk for obesity. Research has shown that optimal feeding strategies in early life and avoidance of screen time may lower the risk of childhood obesity, which in turn, reduces the risk of obesity and its comorbidities through    adulthood. However, few interventions have sought to promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino parents. In addition, most interventions in the literature that address infant obesity prevention have been conducted through home visits or special trips to the intervention site by parents, approaches that may not be sustainable in low-resource settings due to cost and the burden on participants. Given that infants are expected to have 7 well-child visits in the first year of life, primary care is an ideal setting in which to ofer parental education on infant feeding and screen time recommendations. The overall objective of this proposal is to design, pilot test, and refine a Spanish-language, culturally appropriate, primary care-based intervention to prevent obesity in Latino infants born to Spanish-speaking    mothers. Our overarching hypothesis is that focused education on infant feeding and screen time avoidance will lead to use of optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers and result in less weight gain in the first year of life. In preparation for submitting an R01 application to test this hypothesis, we propose research with the following specific aims to be conducted at the San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH) outpatient pediatric clinic: Aim 1: Use the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model to design 5 group educational modules that promote optimal infant feeding and screen time practices among Spanish-speaking Latino mothers; Aim 2: Use a pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) to test a yearlong intervention in which the 5 modules (Aim 1) are provided to Spanish-speaking Latino mothers just after well-child visits at ages 2 weeks, and 2, 4, 6, and 12 months (primary outcomes will include use of responsive feeding practices, infant dietary intake, and infant active and passive television viewing time; secondary outcomes will be infant anthropometrics); Aim 3: Use qualitative methods to assess how individual components of the intervention from Aim 2 affected feeding and screen time practices. By the conclusion of    this award, we will have a scalable and potentially reproducible intervention for infant feeding and screen time practices, one that is linguistically and culturally appropriate for Spanish-speaking Latino parents and aims to reduce weight gain in the first year of life while promoting habits that protect against obesity across the lifespan. Dr. Amy Beck, PI for this mentored career development award, is a bilingual pediatrician with considerable clinical experience caring for low-income Latino children and a deep commitment to improving health outcomes    in this population. Dr. Beck is a pediatric attending at SFGH (a public hospital affiliated with UCSF that serves a majority Latino population) where she provides both general pediatric care and also is the co-director of the pediatric obesity clinic. With respect to her research background, Dr. Beck holds a MPH and completed a General Pediatrics research fellowship at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). During her fellowship, Dr. Beck used both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate risk factors for obesity among Latino children. She has 5 first-author publications, of which 4 directly inform this proposal. She is currently conducting two pilot intervention studies in obesity prevention and treatment for Latino children. Her long-term career goal is to be an independent investigator in the field of obesity prevention with a focus on improving preventive services for low-income Latino children. To accomplish this goal, Dr. Beck must strengthen her skills in biostatistics and qualitative methods and acquire new skills in dietary analysis and RCTs of behavioral interventions. Dr. Beck has formed an    interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors and consultants with expertise in general pediatrics, nutrition, psychology, anthropology, Latino health, pediatric obesity, and health policy. Her primary mentor, Dr. Michael Cabana, is an internationally respected health services researcher and the Division Chief of General Pediatrics at UCSF. Dr. Cabana has extensive expertise in the design and conduct of RCTs in the ambulatory setting and a strong track record of mentorship. In addition to her mentored research plan and ongoing tutorials with her    diverse mentorship team, Dr. Beck will take advantage of UCSF's numerous opportunities for research training. She will enroll in additional courses offered through the Training in Clinical Research Program that cover specific areas of her career development plan. She will also take a course at the UC Berkeley School of Public Health on dietary assessment. Finally, she will attend seminars offered by the Division of General Pediatrics and participate in the K scholars program offered by the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at UCSF. Dr. Beck has the full support of the UCSF Department of Pediatrics and the Division of General Pediatrics for this proposed award. By the conclusion of this award, Dr. Beck will be well positioned as an    independent investigator in the field of childhood obesity prevention research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The aims of the proposed research are to design and evaluate a low-cost, primary care-based intervention to prevent the onset of obesity in Latino infants. This proposal is relevant to public health because obesity often begins early in life and is associated with diabetes, heart disease, and numerous other comorbidities, and because Latino children in the United States experience disproportionately high rates of obesity. The goal of the proposed intervention is to promote infant feeding, nutrition and screen time practices that will be protective against obesity across the lifespan.",Enhanced Primary Care Nutrition

"Tu Salud Si Cuenta!  Reaching Latino family dyads to increase physical activity and healthy eating ABSTRACT Most adults in the U.S. fail to meet national physical activity (PA) and dietary recommendations, and Latinos are less likely to meet these recommendations than non-Latino Whites. Physical inactivity, a poor diet, and obesity are major risk factors for cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, diabetes, and stroke and are important contributors to preventable morbidity and mortality in the U.S. Social environments are widely recognized to have an important impact on these behaviors, yet most behavior change programs give limited attention to the social contexts in which behaviors occur. The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the efficacy of a 6-month, community-based family dyad intervention in promoting engagement in and maintenance of PA and healthy eating among Latino adults residing in three predominantly Latino communities in Houston, TX. Dyads will be randomly assigned to a community health worker (CHW)-led intervention, “Tu Salud, ¡Si Cuenta! – Familiar” (TSSC-Family) or to a contact control condition focused on healthy homes. TSSC-Family will consist of six home visits delivered to dyad members over a six-month period to build behavioral skills and social support for sustained healthy behavior change among Latino family dyads. The healthy homes contact control will also consist of six monthly visits delivered to dyad members by a CHW. Study participants will include 552 Latino adults not currently meeting PA or nutrition recommendations recruited and enrolled as family member dyads (n=276 dyads). This approach expands on an empirically- based motivational behavior change intervention developed by a member of the investigative team in collaboration with community partners that has shown preliminary evidence of effectiveness for positive PA and dietary behavior change in Latino individuals. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months after baseline to evaluate both intermediate and long-term effects. Primary outcomes include minutes per week of moderate and vigorous PA, and servings of fruits and vegetables, sugar-sweetened beverages, and whole grains. Weight loss is a secondary outcome. Self-efficacy, stage of change, social support, and social control will also be examined as potential mediators of changes in PA and nutrition. The proposed research is innovative in its use of a novel intervention that emphasizes dyadic social processes in addition to standard behavior change strategies. The intervention explicitly targets family-based social networks to foster social environments supportive of healthy behavior change using CHWs to facilitate home-based outreach and communication to this understudied population. This research is expected to yield critical insight regarding effective approaches for increasing PA and healthy eating among Latinos, the largest and among the fastest growing minority groups in the U.S. NARRATIVE The proposed research seeks to address Latino health disparities in chronic disease risk by evaluating a novel intervention focused on motivation, behavior skills, and family social contexts to increase physical activity and healthy eating in Latino adults. The community-engaged research approach and the use of community health workers to deliver the intervention builds community capacity and enhances the potential to effectively address health disparities. Results will yield critical information regarding effective community-based intervention approaches and facilitate understanding of how this type of intervention can work in real-world settings.",Tu Salud Si Cuenta!

"Sleep Apnea Phenotypes in Latinos (SLEPT) Project Summary Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a vascular risk factor that can lead to development of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Importantly, OSA is highly prevalent in Latinos, who have more than a 2-fold risk of diabetes and CVD compared to non-Hispanic whites; disparities that motivated this R21 application. Treatment of OSA has not consistently reduced cardiovascular risk in clinical trials, results partly explained by suboptimal adherence to positive airway pressure therapy. Alternatively, identifying the subset of individuals who respond more favorably to OSA therapy can lead to personalized care and greater reduction in CVD. Of interest, OSA phenotypes have been described using data-driven analytical methods, such as cluster analysis, allowing evaluation of distinct groups of OSA patients at higher risk for CVD. Importantly, OSA phenotypes have not been described in Latinos, who have a large burden of diabetes and CVD. In addition, most studies are comprised of middle-aged males from clinical centers, which could introduce selection bias. Hence, there is a gap of prospective population based studies that can advance our understanding of OSA phenotypes and CVD risk, especially in a large and diverse sample of Latinos. Sleep apnea phenotypes in Latinos (SLEPT) evaluate OSA phenotypes in a large population-based cohort of U.S. Latinos. We efficiently leveraged the baseline and second- wave data of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SOL; N=16,415). SOL provides extensive and detailed data on sociocultural, genetic, and cardiovascular risk factors. At baseline (2008-2011), SOL obtained home-sleep test in over 16,000 participants and sleep habits through questionnaires and actigraphy, in a subsample of 2,252 SOL participants. In this exploratory study, we propose to analyze the sleep and cardiovascular measures obtained at SOL Visit 1 and new emerging data, obtained during follow-up in visit 2 (years 2014-2017). SLEPT will define the sleep phenotypes associated to early cardiovascular risk; provide preliminary data for polysomnography in future studies and identify at-risk individuals for sleep interventions and CVD outcomes in SOL. Therefore we aim to 1) identify OSA phenotypes across age, sex and Latino groups and 2) determine which phenotypes associates with prevalent and incident diabetes mellitus and CVD. By year 2060, 29% of the U.S. population will be Latino. However, there is no information about the OSA phenotypes that prospectively associate with CVD risk in Latinos. SLEPT will address the factors that explain within Latino differences in sleep, diabetes and CVD; in addition to Latino health disparities when compared to other U.S. demographic groups. This study is responsive to Healthy People 2020 goals and the NIH/NHLBI workshop on Personalized Medicine and Hispanic Health. Project Narrative We analyzed sleep apnea clinical phenotypes across age, gender and Latino groups that predict incident diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease.

"Biological determinants of colorectal cancer outcomes in Latinos of diverse ancestral origins ABSTRACT Hispanics/Latinos (Latinos) are the 2nd largest and fastest growing ethnic group in the United States. Although typically grouped as a single ethnic minority, Latinos are a heterogeneous population with diverse national origins, unique genetic admixture patterns (African, European, and Indigenous American ancestry), and a wide spectrum of socio-demographic characteristics. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common and fatal cancer among all Latinos combined; however, mortality rates differ substantially within Latino subpopulations defined, thus far, by place of birth. Rates are substantially higher in Puerto Ricans and Cubans, the subgroups with the highest African ancestry, than in Mexicans and non-Hispanic Whites (NHW). After accounting for socioeconomic status and access to care inequalities, differences in mortality persist, highlighting the need to accurately characterize and critically assess biological contributors to intra- and inter-ethnic group disparities. To overcome Latino underrepresentation in publicly available datasets, we propose to join resources from well- annotated epidemiologic studies including the Hispanic Colorectal Cancer Study (HCCS, R01CA155101), the Puerto Rico Biobank (PRBB, U54CA163068), and the Moffitt Cancer Center Total Cancer Care (TCC) cohort into a new consortium, the Latino Colorectal Cancer Consortium (LC3). This strategy allows us to maximize sample size and adequately represent the most common Latino subgroups in the US (i.e. Mexican, with high Indigenous American ancestry; Puerto Rican; and Cuban). We will characterize the somatic mutational profiles of Latino CRCs by whole exome sequencing using previously-collected tissues from the HCCS, PRBB, and TCC (n=600). For comparisons across racial/ethnic groups, we will leverage existing tumor sequencing data from NHW and African American (AA) CRCs in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO; 7,000 NHW), The Cancer Genome Atlas (283 NHW and 61 AA), and TCC (589 NHW and 40 AA). Here, we will examine driver mutation frequencies associated with estimated local and global genetic ancestry in Latino CRC cases (Aim 1), conduct a trans-ethnic analysis comparing frequencies of ancestry-associated and known clinically-actionable driver mutations in Latinos to NHW and AA (Aim 2), and assess the implications of genetic ancestry for survival as well as differential efficacy of conventional and potential targeted therapies for metastatic CRC using patient-derived xenograft (PDX)-based ex vivo live tissue sensitivity assays (LTSA) (Aim 3). Ancestry-specific PDX models will be established using fresh tissue from 40 prospectively recruited Latino, AA, and NHW TCC participants. Our innovative LTSA approach permits timely screening of multiple therapeutic agents while maintaining the tumor microenvironment and reliably predicting clinical responses. Results from this study will help us better understand the biological underpinnings of outcome disparities in Latino subgroups to inform translational efforts towards precision clinical applications. PROJECT NARRATIVE Our project is focused on characterizing genetic features of colorectal cancer among major Latino subgroups in the United States (i.e. Mexican/Central American and Caribbean), who differ in ancestral backgrounds and colorectal cancer mortality rates. Our aims are to identify new cancer driver mutations present in Latinos with high indigenous American or African ancestry and to test their implications for treatment response and prognosis. This area of research has received limited attention despite the compelling advantages of studying admixed populations for optimizing treatment strategies targeted to individuals of specific

"Participatory Trial of a Health Promoting School Approach to Positive Youth Development and Wellness Promotion ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):The overarching goal of this study is to address key adolescent health issues (substance use, emotional well-being, developmental assets) and critical social determinants of health (academic engagement and achievement) for all students, but 9th grade youth of Latino, Hmong, Somali and other African heritage in particular, through a focus on student-school connectedness and the school environment. The school environment, including student-teacher relationships and opportunities for meaningful student participation, establishes student connectedness, leading to multiple health-protective outcomes. However youth of color often express less connection to school. Health Promoting Schools' interventions may improve connectedness by addressing 3 components: 1) classroom wellbeing topics/approaches, 2) school environment or ethos, 3) links with families and/or communities. We will build on a NIMHD (R24MD00766-01)-funded pilot that developed and evaluated Project TRUST (Training for Resiliency in Urban Students and Teachers), an intervention to support teachers in improving relationships with, and promoting PYD for Somali, Latino, and Hmong 9th grade youth. Core partners Somali, Latino and Hmong Partnership for Health and Wellness (SoLaHmo), University of Minnesota Program in Health Disparities Research and College of Education and Human Development along with teachers, parents, and youth co-developed and piloted the intervention. Findings suggest that Project TRUST is feasible and acceptable to educators and may improve youth educational engagement, emotional well-being, and developmental assets across race/ethnic groups. Findings identified the need for broader improvements in the school environment and involvement with parents to substantively improve connectedness. In the current proposal we will expand our CBPR Coalition to co-direct refinement and implementation of a multi- component Health Promoting Schools intervention including: 1) pilot-tested teacher professional development, 2) student- defined enhanced environment, and 3) parent-defined enhanced community/family connection. The Coalition will finalize the intervention using a phased intervention map that integrates community perspectives with theoretical approaches to PYD and evidence based practices. The study aims will be accomplished through a group randomized trial in 10 urban schools with diverse populations representing approximately 1,900 students. Study aims are: Aim 1: Assess the effects of a school-based multi-component intervention on improved school connectedness, school engagement, and developmental assets through a group randomized, participatory trial. Aim 2: Assess the effects of a health promoting schools multi-component intervention on emotional well-being, tobacco and other substance use, and academic outcomes through a group randomized, participatory trial. Aim 3: Evaluate the relationships between participatory factors (CBPR collaborative processes, capacities, and contextual factors), school intervention implementation, and study outcomes. The focus on school connectedness and environment as key proximal social determinants of health and promising intervention targets is innovative while the CBPR approach assures project success and sustainability. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of our study is to use a community based participatory research approach to implement and evaluate a multi-component school-based intervention to enhance emotional well-being and academic achievement, and prevent tobacco and other substance use through the promotion of student-school connectedness for all students, but Latino, Hmong, Somali and other African heritage 9th grade youth in particular. We will build on a NIMHD -funded pilot that developed and evaluated Project TRUST (Training for Resiliency in Urban Students and Teachers), an intervention to support teachers in improving relationships with, and promoting positive youth development for Somali, Latino, and Hmong 9th grade youth.

"FOCUS: Foreign Born Latinos Cardiovascular Screening Project Summary/Abstract  Latino immigrants experience numerous disparities in the receipt of routine health care. They are at risk for significant poor outcomes from cardiovascular disease; however, the extent to which Latino immigrants experience appropriate cancer screening and prevention services, compared with US born-Latinos and non- Hispanic whites, is not well understood. This may be, in part, because studying the health care of Latino immigrants has numerous challenges. Foreign-born status is not widely and routinely collected, and foreign born patients may not have the access to healthcare related datasets that would objectively record their healthcare utilization. Additionally, there is some scientific evidence that different sub groups of immigrants may receive different services; specific ethnic subgroup (Mexican individuals, for instance), Spanish speaking individuals, rural- residing immigrants may utilize services differently than contrasting groups. However, knowledge on these differences is incomplete because studies to date have failed to include all necessary data to understand these relationships.  In order to better understand cardiovascular prevention disparities between foreign-born Latinos, US- born Latinos, and non-Hispanic Whites, we will leverage a unique data resource from a large, national network of community health centers with shared electronic health record data that is linked to community-level social determinants of health data. This large, longitudinal dataset contains country of birth for >87,000 Latinos and also contains unprecedented data linkages which will let us assess disparities and better understand which specific groups are most at risk for the under-utilization of cardiovascular prevention. Understanding these factors that most heavily impact cardiovascular preventive service use is crucial to the prioritization of population-based interventions to improve cardiovascular outcomes.  This research will enable action/intervention in three ways: 1. It will enable more informed policy decisions to improve public health and wellness in foreign born Latinos. 2. It will facilitate strategic partnerships between healthcare providers and community agencies poised to intervene in social factors in the lives of Latino immigrants. 3. It will help clinical providers understand their patients' barriers to care utilization, and further point-of-care efforts to address these barriers that influence their Latino immigrant patients' utilization of recommended cardiovascular prevention services. Project Narrative  Foreign-born Latinos in the United States are at risk for poor health outcomes, including poor outcomes for cardiovascular disease. It is uncertain whether or not they receive fewer prevention services for cardiovascular conditions, and if so, which specific factors may be most responsible for the lower receipt of these services. This project will use a highly innovative electronic health record database that contains country of birth information and is linked to community information in order provide policy makers and healthcare providers better information about what cardiovascular prevention services their patients or community members are most at risk for underutilizing.",FOCUS: Foreign Born Latinos Cardiovascular Screening,10049460,R01MD014120,"['Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Geography ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Immigration ', ' Insurance ', ' Language ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Tobacco ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Record Linkage Study ', ' Data Linkages ', ' Data Bases ', ' data base ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Immigrant ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Smoker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Country ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' authority ', ' prevention service ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' demographics ', ' service utilization ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' health data ', ' Preventative service ', ' Preventive service ', ' Cuban ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' longitudinal data set ', ' longitudinal dataset ', ' data resource ', ' rurality ', ' urban residence ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,581554,0.18000577803650297
"The Effect of Pesticide Exposure on Cognitive and Brain Development in Latino Children: PACE5 Concern is mounting that commonly used pesticides are detrimental to children. Children are rapidly undergoing cognitive, sensory, and motor development, and disruption of normal maturation can have life-long consequences. The extant literature strongly indicates that prenatal exposure to pesticides leads to abnormal neurobehavioral development. A recent brain imaging study further showed that prenatal pesticide exposure is associated with disrupted anatomical brain development. However, results concerning the consequences of postnatal pesticide exposure are much less conclusive. Some studies have reported neurobehavioral deficits following postnatal pesticide exposure, but just as many studies have reported no negative consequences. Currently there are no studies that assess the effects of postnatal pesticide exposure on brain development using anatomical or functional brain imaging. More conclusive research on the effects of postnatal exposure on neurodevelopment requires a highly exposed population, a longitudinal design, and careful quantification of exposure and outcomes. We propose a two-group, prospective, longitudinal study of Latino children 7 years of age with quarterly measurement of cumulative pesticide exposure using passive dosimetry wristbands as well as documentation of prenatal and early life exposure through life history techniques. Children from Latino seasonal farmworker families will be compared with children from Latino families not participating in farm work and not living in an agricultural environment. Children in Latino farmworker families are at particularly high risk of exposure. Not only are pesticides frequently used in their low quality housing, but they are also exposed to agricultural pesticides used in nearby fields brought home by parental/sibling farmworkers on clothing. Children will be followed for 2 years with measurement of neurobehavioral function at baseline, 1 year, and 2 years. Neuroimaging will be performed in a subset of participants with structural and functional brain organization assessed at baseline and two years later. Specific aims for this project are: Aim 1: Compare 2-year longitudinal and prenatal/early life pesticide exposure between children of Latino seasonal farmworkers and children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Aim 2: Compare 2-year longitudinal neurobehavioral and emotional and behavioral functioning among children of Latino seasonal farmworkers relative to children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Aim 3: Compare 2-year longitudinal anatomical and functional brain development between children of Latino seasonal farmworkers and children of Latino parents who are not farmworkers. Our nearly two decades of environmental justice (EJ) and community-based participatory research (CBPR) on pesticide exposure with farmworkers and their families provides an auspicious context to engage this vulnerable population in a study of both scientific and environmental justice importance. Most research indicates that prenatal pesticide exposure is detrimental to the developing brain. However, results concerning the effects of postnatal pesticide exposure on brain development are conflicting. The current project will evaluate the effects of pesticide exposure on neurobehavioral and brain development children from Latino farmworker families.",The Effect of Pesticide Exposure on Cognitive and Brain Development in Latino Children: PACE5,9926889,R01ES008739,"['Affect ', ' Agriculture ', ' agricultural ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Cholinesterases ', ' Acylcholine acylhydrolase ', ' Acylcholineacylhydrolase ', ' choline esterase II ', ' Clothing ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Housing ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Metabolism ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Parents ', ' Pest Control ', ' Pesticides ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Siblings ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Area ', ' Surface ', ' Chronic ', ' Chemicals ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Published Comment ', ' Exposure to ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' postnatal ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' Farm ', ' farm environment ', ' Farming environment ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' life history ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' dosimetry ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' Documentation ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' developmental disorder ', ' developmental disease ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Organophosphates ', ' Motor ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Calendar ', ' Cognitive ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' neurobehavioral ', ' pesticide exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' 7 years of age ', ' age 7 years ', ' seven year old ', ' seven years of age ', ' 7 year old ', ' neurotoxic ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' high risk ', ' environmental justice ', ' longitudinal design ', ' early life exposure ', ' Study of Latinos ', ' neuroimaging biomarker ', ' neuroimaging marker ', ' imaging study ', ' agricultural pesticide ', ' ']",NIEHS,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2020,662792,0.11835069153271467
"Mechanisms of Behavior Change in a Cultural Adaptation of Motivational Interviewing Proposal Summary/Abstract Project Title: Mechanisms of Behavior Change in Culturally Adapted Motivational Interviewing The NIAAA Five Year Strategic Plan prioritizes health disparities research for socially disadvantaged Latinos to reduce the disproportionate burden of negative consequences related to alcohol use compared to other racial/ethnic groups (NIAAA, 2013/2016). Cultural adaptation of evidence-based treatments, such as motivational interviewing (MI), can improve access and overall response to alcohol treatment. However, research progress has been hindered by the few theoretically-guided tests of adaptation and limited knowledge about the active ingredients and mechanisms of behavior change that might discriminate an adapted, compared to non-adapted, intervention. The proposed study will fill this important gap by testing a series of theory-driven hypotheses regarding the within-session predictors of MI outcome and a novel mechanism of culturally adapted MI (CAMI) (self-exploration → decreases in perceived acculturation stress, reduced depression and anxiety → reduced heavy drinking and consequences). The proposed study codes and examines within-session, process data from a parent RCT (AAR01021136, Lee: PI) guided by adaptation theory initially tested in a small RCT (AAK23021136, Lee: PI) that showed promising effects in favor of CAMI (Lee et al., 2013). The ongoing parent CAMI trial compared single session MI to single session CAMI delivered to Latino heavy drinkers (N=301, 18-65 yrs old). The parent study design (e.g., assessment of multiple self-report mediators) permits examination of a causal model, while attending to key recommendations on examining mechanisms of change (Kazdin & Nock, 2003). Up-to-date statistical approaches will be used to examine the MI causal hypothesis, such as investigating change and sustain talk together as a proportion estimate (Magill et al., 2014). The parent study design, which used an active comparator (MI), permits between-condition tests of within-session ingredients and mechanisms, which is a level of contrast rare in MI theory and one of the first a- priori investigations of processes of change in an adaptation study. The first task in adaptation is to confirm that key active treatment ingredients and mechanisms are preserved, so study aims are first, to assess MI ingredients and mechanisms among Latino adults, second, to examine novel MI ingredients and mechanisms potentially relevant to both conditions, and third, to test the theory, ingredients, and mechanisms specific to the adaptation. Long term objectives. Findings will improve dissemination of MI to Latinos by providing empirically-based guidelines on therapist training and on critical MI intervention ingredients. It will also improve understanding of the stress-health behavior link observed among health disparities populations and how MI can be used to disrupt this association. The proposed study will be one of the first to contribute to the emerging science on mechanisms of behavior change with health disparities populations and will yield important recommendations on the science of adaptation and ways to improve MI dissemination to community settings. Project Narrative Process research investigates how behavioral treatments work, thus findings can be used to optimize intervention efficacy and efficiency. In this process study we examine the within- session (motivational interviewing, MI) treatment predictors of behavior change in a health disparities population, socially-disadvantaged Latino heavy drinkers. The findings of this study, one of the first to examine mechanisms of MI cultural adaptation, will yield important recommendations on ways to improve MI dissemination to community settings serving Latino alcohol users as well as the science of adaptation more broadly.",Mechanisms of Behavior Change in a Cultural Adaptation of Motivational Interviewing,10086231,R01AA025485,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Client ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Empathy ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Group Processes ', ' social group process ', ' Health behavior ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' behavior change ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' drink heavily ', ' excessive alcohol consumption ', ' excessive alcohol ingestion ', ' excessive alcohol intake ', ' excessive drinking ', ' excessive ethanol ingestion ', ' extreme drinking ', ' heavy alcohol use ', ' Heavy Drinking ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' alcohol abuse treatment ', ' alcohol treatment ', ' alcohol abuse therapy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' active technique ', ' active treatment ', ' active method ', ' Evidence based treatment ', ' active comparator ', ' pilot trial ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' trial comparing ', ' ethanol response ', ' response to alcohol ', ' response to ethanol ', ' alcohol response ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' causal diagram ', ' causal model ', ' improved outcome ', ' preservation ', ' social disadvantage ', ' ']",NIAAA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R01,2020,493305,0.05715228624284024
"CRISOL: Building Community Resilience and Integrating Efforts to Understand and Address Syndemic Health Conditions Afflicting Young LatinoImmigrants This goal of this competitive revision is to expand our original project to adapt, implement and evaluate a multi- level intervention to mitigate the multi-dimensional toll of COVID19 among Latino immigrant communities in Philadelphia. Evidence of effective strategies to curb the pandemic, reduce disparities and mitigate its impact is lacking and very urgent. In the US, Latino immigrants are one of the groups hardest hit by this pandemic, with recent steep increases in COVID-19 deaths among this group corroborating their continued increased risk of infection and increased susceptibility. Latino immigrants have long exhibited disparities in diabetes, obesity and hypertension, factors known to increase COVID-19 related severity, and also in Substance Abuse, Violence exposure, HIV/AIDS, and MEntal health (SAVAME) syndemic. These syndemic conditions have been worsened in the context of COVID-19. Latino immigrants represent a hard-to-reach and marginalized population, with extremely limited access to adequate health care and safety nets. This group faces many structural barriers, and social vulnerabilities, that hinder their capacity to access COVID-19 testing and treatment services and to adhere to public health interventions and measures to decrease the spread of COVID-19. Latinos often rely on a thin and fragmented network of health and social services organizations. Intervention to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on this population will need to have a broad stakeholder engagement and address a wide range of health determinants. Peer-driven interventions have been effective for the prevention and control of infectious diseases such as HIV, STIs among Latino populations. Strengthening the links between community members and these organizations and promoting inter- organizational coordination to meet syndemic health, behavioral, economic, and legal needs of Latino communities are essential elements to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on this low-resource population. In direct response to the NOT-MD-20-022/PAR PA-18-935, our ongoing community-academic partnership proposes to evaluate “CRISOL Contigo,” a multi-level intervention to address the needs created or magnified by the COVID-19 pandemic among Latino communities in Philadelphia. CRISOL Contigo includes a peer- driven program and mobilization of Latino-serving organizations. In aim 1, we will adapt an ongoing Popular Opinion Leader (POL) program to address the unique health, social, and economic needs related to COVID-19 and the SAVAME syndemic. In aim 2, we will assess the efficacy of CRISOL Contigo to improve COVID-19 related preventive health behaviors and use and access to COVID-19 related testing and care (co-primary outcomes). In aim 3, we will examine the impact of CRISOL Contigo on community assets, interagency collaborations and coordination among the Latino-serving organizations in Philadelphia. There are almost 20 million Latino immigrants in the US, and they play a central role in sustaining the vital parts of the US economy Tailored, multi-level interventions that consider the unique needs of Latinos are urgently needed to mitigate the impact of this and future outbreaks of COVID-19 on this disadvantaged population. Latinos have been one of the racial/ethnic groups most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and evidence of effective strategies to curb the pandemic, reduce disparities and mitigate its impact is lacking and very urgent. This goal of this competitive revision is to expand an ongoing academic-community partnership to adapt, implement and evaluate a multi level intervention to mitigate the multi-dimensional toll of COVID19 among Latino immigrant communities in Philadelphia.

"Defining the molecular genomic landscae and tumor microenvironment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer in a raciall diverse cohort Overall- Project Summary The Florida-California Cancer Research, Education & Engagement (CaRE2) Health Equity is proposed by the University of Florida (UF), Florida A&M University (FAMU) and the University of Southern California-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC-NCCC) to eliminate cancer health disparities in Florida, California and nationally. The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at FAMU, and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The bi-coastal location offers access to uniquely diverse populations of Blacks and Latinos, facilitating in an unprecedented way, the study of cancer disparities in these incredibly heterogeneous populations. Specifically, the center will focus on studying relevant issues and serving the needs of: (1) Black subpopulations, including American-born, African-born and Caribbean-born Blacks; and (2) Latino subpopulations including Mexican- Americans, Caribbean Latinos, Central and South Americans. This triad brings together investigators and institutions in the two US states that currently have the highest cancer incidence and mortality. The main scientific focus of the center is translational disparities research among heterogeneous minority populations focusing on cancers known for high mortality. We propose to coalesce expertise, infrastructure and share resources in support of 6 innovative translational research projects focused on understanding the biological basis of disparities in Black and Latino populations, capturing the wide heterogeneity within these two groups, with two foundational projects focusing on pancreas cancer (one full, one pilot) and one full project focusing on prostate cancer (Aim 1). Under the leadership of the Research Education Core, we propose to train 100 Black and Latino investigators, including students and early stage investigators (ESI), in translational cancer health disparity research (Aim 2). Existing community partnerships in the Outreach Core will be leveraged to disseminate findings in the Black and Latino community, educate about pancreas and prostate cancer, and improve participation in biomedical research (Aim 3). Finally, the Planning and Evaluation Core will implement a systematic planning and evaluation plan to improve Center effectiveness using innovative strategies (Aim 4). All research projects will be facilitated and enriched by resources and approaches provided by the Tissue Modeling Core and Bioinformatics, Statistical and Methodological Core. All CaRE2 Center’s activities will be centralized and overseen by the Administrative Core. The FAMU-UF-USC partnership is ideally suited to achieve these aims. Both UF and FAMU have worked closely together addressing cancer disparities in Florida Blacks for the last 4 years. USC-NCCC provides complementary and synergistic expertise in cancer disparities research, research training for the Latino population, and expertise in developing culturally-sensitive tools to reduce cancer disparities among Latinos. Project Narrative The long term goals of the CaRE2 center are to reduce cancer disparities in Blacks and Latinos, to train and increase the pool of underrepresented Black and Latino scientists conducting health disparity research, to increase research capacity at an ISUPS (FAMU), and to increase cancer disparity research at UF and USC-NCCC. The proposed two full projects and pilot project include investigators from the three institutions and will leverage on specimens collected across the partnership from Blacks and Latinos, representing a wide range of subpopulations within these minority groups. Thus, our studies will reveal unprecedented findings about these two understudied minority populations. Importantly, these projects will be instrumental in transferring cutting edge and innovative technologies to FAMU, will provide research training opportunities across the partnership to 100 students, post-doctoral fellows, and early stage investigators, and will expand in a significant way the research focus at UF and USC-NCCC to address cancer health disparities in prostate and pancreas cancer.",Defining the molecular genomic landscae and tumor microenvironment of squamous non-small cell lung cancer in a raciall diverse cohort,10150337,U54CA233465,"['Biomedical Research ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Non-Small-Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' NSCLC ', ' NSCLC - Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ', ' Nonsmall Cell Lung Carcinoma ', ' nonsmall cell lung cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Rural Population ', ' Students ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Central American ', ' Fostering ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Multiculturalism ', ' Cultural Diversity ', ' tool ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' pancreatic malignancy ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Scientist ', ' South American ', ' Location ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' innovative technologies ', ' American ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer care ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Tissue Model ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' cancer microenvironment ', ' tumor microenvironment ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' minority trainee ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' demographics ', ' health equity ', ' screening ', ' genetic make-up ', ' genetic makeup ', ' recruit teachers ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' community partnership ', ' Student recruitment ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' minority scientist ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' translational cancer research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,U54,2020,165479,0.10193405198938464
"Health Disparities Research at UCR Center for Health Disparities Research at UCR (HDR@UCR) We propose a research center with a focus on health disparities among Latino/Hispanic communities in Inland Southern California, a rapidly growing and diverse region of more than 4.3 million people. There are pronounced health disparities in the region, which is also characterized by a severe shortage of healthcare professionals, particularly primary care physicians. Leading the Center will be the School of Medicine at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), a federally designated Hispanic-serving Institution and a national model for diversity and student success. The aims of the Center for Health Disparities at UCR include creating a rich interdisciplinary and collaborative environment for health disparities research, infusing community-engaged research methods into the academic culture, and equipping investigators with tools and training to improve their extramural funding success. The Center will bring together broad interdisciplinary approaches, including environmental sciences and biomedical sciences, as well as social science methods to study health disparities. This Center will be built around a Community Engagement and Dissemination Core, based in the UCR School of Medicine Center for Healthy Communities, which has already established community networks among the Latino, Asian-Pacific Islander, and Native American communities in the region. Our Center will also provide expanded capabilities in disparities research with the Research Infrastructure Core, providing a range of training programs for graduate, postdoctoral, and new Principal Investigator development. Importantly, this Core will also create an innovative social sciences collaboratory as a new model for continuity in community-engaged social sciences research. There are two Research Projects in this Center, with one basic biomedical project focused on testing the correlates of environmental aerosol exposures in Latino neighborhoods in eastern Coachella Valley with asthma and cardiopulmonary disease. A behavioral research project will focus on the relationship between infant feeding styles and practices in low-income Latino families and infant growth and obesity. In addition, an Investigator Development Core will support pilot research projects for young investigators, incorporating a mentorship program to assist investigators with grantsmanship skills and training in community-based research. Finally, we will establish a Recruitment Core, which will build on recent success at UCR in recruiting and hiring a diverse faculty cohort. The Center has been designed to move UCR toward realizing its tremendous potential to become a national leader in health disparities research and training and to inform the national dialogue on health disparities in Latino communities. The proposed center, Center for Health Disparities Research at UCR (HDR@UCR), will expand institutional capacity to conduct high-quality research leading to interventions that improve the health of Latino communities in a large, rapidly growing and diverse region of California.

"Social Stress Epigenetics and Cardio-Metabolic Health Among Latinos Latinos, the largest ethnic minority group in the United States, have a high prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and obesity and also experience higher rates of poverty and social stressors in both childhood and adulthood compared to other racial/ethnic groups. There is extensive evidence that economic and social stressors shape the development of cardiometabolic health. However, it is largely unknown how these stressors affect biological processes, particularly at the cellular level. One novel method to evaluate possible mechanisms underlying the associations between social stressors and cardiometabolic health across the life course is DNA methylation (DNAm). Recently a handful of small cross-sectional studies have found that stressful experiences may alter DNAm, thus providing a potential mechanism by which social stress may get under the skin. Most of the existing health research among Latinos has been specific to Latinos of Mexican origin. Latinos are not a homogenous group and while some Latinos are at greater risk of certain chronic conditions, other Latino groups may be at lower risk for certain conditions. Examining what factors may confer risk to some Latino ethnic groups or protect other Latino ethnic groups is crucial for developing interventions and informing decisions about resource allocation. We propose to examine the association between social and economic stressors, across the life course in relation to DNAm, as well as the rate of change of methylation and changes in cardiometabolic health, using existing data from the Hispanic Community Health Study /Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL). The HCHS/SOL study is a longitudinal study of US Latinos, representing varied countries of origin, conducted in the US. We propose to use existing data from a stratified random sample of 500 men and 500 women, who completed an extensive set of socio-economic and stress measures in the HCHS/SOL Sociocultural Ancillary study and who provided blood samples at two different time points six years apart in adulthood. Existing blood samples will be assayed for genome-wide DNAm and DNAm age. Cardiometabolic health markers (obesity, diabetes, hypertension and lipids) have also been assessed at two time points. Existing data also includes repeated assessments of social and economic stressors and socio-cultural factors (i.e., nativity, familism, acculturation, social support). Specifically, we will examine 1) whether social and economic stressors in childhood and adulthood are associated with changes in DNAm age and genome-wide methylation over a 6-year period; 2) whether sociocultural factors modify the association between stressors and changes in DNAm and 3) whether DNAm is associated with changes in cardiometabolic health over a 6-year period. Upon completion of this project, our findings will advance understanding of how social and economic stressors shape epigenetic pathways, what factors may exacerbate or ameliorate these pathways and whether epigenetic changes over time influence cardiometabolic health changes. Project Narrative Economic and social stressors are increasingly recognized as important factors that shape the development of cardiometabolic health particularly among Latinos, who experience a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease. However, particularly at the cellular level, biological pathways through which stress affects health disparities are not fully understood. We propose to address these gaps by examining the independent and cumulative impact of both economic and social stressors across the life course in relation to DNA methylation (e.g. DNA methylation age and genome-wide methylation) among a diverse sample of Latinos living in the US, whether modifying factors relevant to Latino populations may ameliorate or exacerbate this relation as well as how these epigenetic factors may impact cardiometabolic health.",Social Stress Epigenetics and Cardio-Metabolic Health Among Latinos,9925830,R01MD013320,"['Acceleration ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Child Abuse ', ' Childhood Abuse ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronology ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Inflammation ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Lipids ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Minority Groups ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Poverty ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Glucocorticoid Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Resource Allocation ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Mexican ', ' Policies ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Country ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dominican ', ' NR3C1 ', ' NR3C1 gene ', ' Receptor Gene ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' genome scale ', ' genomewide ', ' genome-wide ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' global methylation ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' rate of change ', ' HCHS/SOL Study ', ' HCHS/SOL cohort ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' Cuban ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NIMHD,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,673012,0.0838366964612906

"Administrative Supplement to Culturally Competent Communication Intervention to Improve Latinos' Engagement in Advance Care Planning K07 Award PROJECT SUMMARY Compared to whites, Latinos are much less likely to engage in various forms of advance care planning (ACP), including completing advance directives and having end-of-life (EOL) discussions. ACP is critical to provision of quality EOL care, as it has been associated with greater likelihood of patients' EOL wishes being followed. Latino advanced cancer patients are also significantly more likely than their white counterparts to receive futile and burdensome aggressive care at the end-of-life, to die in the ICU, and to have care that runs counter to their preferences and values. Dr. Shen's pilot work, along with the current literature, suggests that targeting ACP may help improve Latinos' EOL care. As such, the proposed project will develop and pilot-test a culturally competent communication (CCC) intervention. First, the CCC intervention will be developed based on results from a questionnaire embedded into a current R01 (MPIs: Prigerson, Maciejewski) assessing Latinos' cultural, familial, and religious beliefs as well as their knowledge, motivation (readiness), and action to engage in ACP (n=200). Next, the developed CCC intervention will be vetted among Latino stakeholders and field-tested among Latino advanced cancer patients, using an iterative approach (n=40) to guide the finalization of the intervention. Finally, a pilot randomized trial will examine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential efficacy of the CCC intervention at improving engagement in ACP. Participants (n=50) will be randomly assigned to the intervention (n=25) or attention control group (n=25). Results will provide timely insight into a potentially effective, low burden intervention designed to improve Latinos' engagement in ACP. Dr. Shen is the ideal candidate to spearhead this line of research given her academic background in social psychology and communication research. Dr. Shen's long-term career goal is to lead a program of social scientific research that develops social psychological interventions designed to improve EOL communication and care, with expertise in interventions targeting racial/ethnic minorities. To achieve this goal, as part of her K07, Dr. Shen will receive intensive training in five key areas: (1) EOL care research; (2) clinical intervention development; (3) technology-based health interventions; (4) health disparities, and (5) professional development. The K07 will provide Dr. Shen with several avenues to achieve her training and research goals and enhance her expertise. Dr. Shen will have ongoing meetings with mentors and expert advisors and participate in formal coursework, didactics, workshops, conferences, interactive trainings, and guided research experience. The proposed K07 will form the foundation for a program of research that focuses on developing social psychological interventions to improve EOL communication and care. At the end of the K07 funding period, Dr. Shen will submit an R01 application, based on the results of the present study. Overall, the K07 will provide Dr. Shen with the research experience, intensive training, and mentorship needed to become a successful independent researcher. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research has significant public health relevance and is consistent with the broader goals of public health focuses on improving communication regarding end-of-life care. The development of a Culturally Competent Communication Intervention designed to coach Latino advanced cancer patients in how to communicate EOL goals of care in order to improve their engagement in advance care planning will help reduce Latino/non-Latino disparities in advance care planning and potentially end-of-life care. If the Culturally Competent Communication Intervention proves to be potentially efficacious, there is a strong argument for testing this intervention in a larger, multi-site study to test for effectiveness.",Administrative Supplement to Culturally Competent Communication Intervention to Improve Latinos' Engagement in Advance Care Planning K07 Award,10128085,K07CA207580,"['Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Award ', ' Belief ', ' Communication ', ' Communications Media ', ' Forms of Communication ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Elements ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Motivation ', ' Names ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Do Not Resuscitate Order ', ' Do Not Resuscitate ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Proxy ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' cultural competence ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' end of life care ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Dominican ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Communication Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' social communication ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' end of life communication ', ' end-of-life communication ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' attentional control ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' recruit ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NCI,WEILL MEDICAL COLL OF CORNELL UNIV,K07,2020,54000,0.13502202482112935
"CuidaTXT: a Text Message Dementia-Caregiver Intervention for Latinos Abstract Latino relatives of individuals with dementia are less likely than non-Latino whites to have access to caregiver support. Text messaging can dramatically enhance the reach of effective culturally and linguistically tailored caregiver support interventions. However, to our knowledge, no text message interventions exist to provide caregiver support among caregivers of individuals with dementia. Text message interventions can capitalize on the fact that Latinos own cellphones and use them to text at a higher rate than non-Latino whites. The overall aim of this proposal is to develop and test the first text message intervention for caregiver support of individuals with dementia among Latinos. This intervention, CuidaTXT [Spanish for self-care and texting], will be available in English and Spanish, incorporate two-way messaging and will tailor text messages to the preferences of Latino caregivers. CuidaTXT will be multicomponent and based on the Stress Process Framework as supported by evidence. The intervention will incorporate social support and coping components including AD education, problem-solving skills training, social network support, care management and referral to community resources. This research corresponds with Stage 1 of the NIH Stage Model for Behavioral Intervention Development. In Aim 1, we will develop a culturally and linguistically appropriate text message intervention for caregiver support among Latino family caregivers of individuals with dementia using user- centered design methods. In Aim 2, we will test the feasibility and acceptability of CuidaTXT during six months. Project Narrative Latino families with dementia experience substantial disparities in access to caregiver support compared to their non-Latino white peers, putting them at an increased risk for negative emotional, physical and financial outcomes. This R21 will address this research gap by 1) Developing a culturally and linguistically appropriate text message intervention for caregiver support among Latino family caregivers of individuals with dementia and 2) Testing the feasibility and acceptability of CuidaTXT, a multicomponent text message caregiver support intervention culturally and linguistically tailored for the Latino community.",CuidaTXT: a Text Message Dementia-Caregiver Intervention for Latinos,10056781,R21AG065755,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Aging ', "" Alzheimer's Disease "", ' AD dementia ', ' Alzheimer ', ' Alzheimer Type Dementia ', ' Alzheimer disease ', ' Alzheimer sclerosis ', ' Alzheimer syndrome ', "" Alzheimer's "", "" Alzheimer's disease dementia "", ' Alzheimers Dementia ', ' Alzheimers disease ', ' Primary Senile Degenerative Dementia ', ' dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' primary degenerative dementia ', ' senile dementia of the Alzheimer type ', ' Attention ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' longterm care ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Suggestion ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Vendor ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Latino ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Home Care ', ' patient homecare ', ' patient home care ', ' Individual ', ' Logistics ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' technical report ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' skills training ', ' experience ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Modality ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' Emotional ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' user centered design ', ' usability ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' prototype ', ' secondary outcome ', ' arm ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' family care giving ', ' family caregiving ', ' Care giver intervention ', ' caregiver interventions ', ' dementia care giver ', ' Dementia caregivers ', ' care giver depression ', ' caregiver depression ', ' Care giver support ', ' Caregiver support ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' acute care ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF KANSAS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2020,191250,0.032058916672831665
"Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community members Recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, including skin and respiratory irritation and asthma, as well as potential reproductive effects and breast cancer. Nonetheless, the production and distribution of these products continues to expand. In response public health actions have aimed to reduce exposures through substituting use of environmentally safer products in public buildings and schools and encouraging development of certified environmentally safer product labels. While these initiatives have been successful at reaching certain groups of workers and consumers, low wage domestic and other cleaning workers, who are disproportionately immigrant and Latino, have been largely left out due to factors including knowledge, awareness, cost and accessibility. The Safe and Just Cleaners Project aims to address this environmental health disparity by documenting and reducing exposures to cleaning agents among domestic cleaning workers in the Latino immigrant worker community in NYC, as part of a University- Community partnership. The rationale for this project is that once domestic cleaners, as part of a large and influential community-based organization, gain capacity and knowledge to recognize their exposures and potential risks as workers, this will lay the basis for building a joint worker-community effort that will simultaneously a) improve conditions for themselves as cleaning workers, and b) reduce exposure to hazardous cleaning agents in the larger community of which the workers are a part. Working collaboratively with the largest Latino immigrant community-based organization in NYC, with 30,000 members, the project will survey Latino domestic workers about their use, work practices, values, knowledge and attitudes about potential hazards and self-reported health problems associated with consumer cleaning product use. The project will then identify and quantitatively evaluate the exposure levels and conditions that result in inhalation and dermal exposures to volatile organic and quaternary ammonium compounds, two major and potentially toxic components of commercial cleaning agents, among Latino immigrant domestic cleaning workers. The project will measure exposures both at the time of cleaning as well as residual exposures that might continue to contaminate home environments even after cleaning tasks are complete. These findings will be used to develop and implement a multilevel strategic campaign to reduce exposures among immigrant communities through local and national partnerships. Embedding this campaign within a workers’ rights and social justice perspective provides an approach that educates people about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Although recent research has documented the health impacts of common cleaning chemicals, important populations of users of the agents - low wage domestic cleaning workers who are mainly immigrant and Latino - have inadequate knowledge and limited access to safer alternatives, whether using these products at work or at home. The Safe and Just Cleaners/Limpieza Sana y Justa Project will document exposures to cleaning agents among the Latino immigrant domestic cleaners in NYC. Using a workers’ rights and social justice perspective, the project’s public health campaign will inform Latino domestic cleaners and their communities about safer alternatives while simultaneously pursuing broader programmatic and policy initiatives to reduce exposures.",Safe and Just Cleaners: Reducing exposure to toxic cleaning chemical products among low wage immigrant Latino Community

"Online course to prepare promotores to support low-income Latino parents of children with special healthcare needs KDH Research & Communication (KDHRC) submits this Fast Track SBIR proposal to develop, implement, and rigorously evaluate a culturally competent, online professional development course to prepare promotores to support low-income Latino parents of children with special health care needs (CSHCN) as they navigate the education and health care systems. CSHCN experience poorer health, psychosocial, and academic outcomes than the general child population exhibited by frequent school absences, behavioral problems, grade repetition, and lack of school engagement. Compared to other CSHCN, Latino CSHCN are more likely to experience health and educational disparities including a lack of adequate health care insurance, specialist referrals, and consistent, affordable health care. Latino parents of CSHCN frequently experience difficulties while navigating the education and health care systems. Low-income Latino parents, especially first-generation immigrants, face linguistic and cultural barriers when seeking necessary medical services and educational accommodations for their CSHCN. Promotores, recognized as key health care workers in underserved communities, are ideally positioned to support Latino parents of CSHCN. Puentes will have a broad reach, be cost-effective, appropriate for promotores and their community-based organization (CBO) employers, as well as meet experts’ calls for programs addressing the need for culturally appropriate interventions to support this vulnerable population. Puentes-trained promotores will empower Latino parents with health care and school system navigation skills to benefit their CSHCN. Puentes will contain a six-module online course, which will use text, video clips, and virtual client interactive training. Puentes-trained promotores will build parents’ knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and skills to request educational accommodations, interface with the child’s medical team, meaningfully participate in their child’s educational and medical care teams, coordinate health care and school services, and work with the school to resolve any challenges related to their child’s accommodations. The content and evaluation of Puentes will be driven by the theory of planned behavior, which has extensive empirical support and widespread applicability in health promotion interventions. In Phase I, we will create a program architecture plan comprised of a course outline, video storyboards, and virtual client details as well as a prototype of two full course modules. We will evaluate the modules in a twostage feasibility evaluation study. In Phase II, we will use the architecture plan and feasibility study findings to finalize program videos, courses, resources, and dissemination website. A group-randomized controlled trial will explore the efficacy of Puentes when implemented in Latino-serving CBOs. Our market research suggests a significant need and eager market, and support from more than 39 organizations representing over 6,000 promotores substantiates Puentes’ programmatic importance and commercial potential. Children with special health care needs (CSHCN) encounter obstacles such as school absences, lack of school engagement, and grade repetition that can lead to poor lifelong academic, health, and social outcomes. Latino parents of CSHCN frequently experience linguistic and cultural barriers while navigating the education and health care systems, compounding the disparities their children experience. Puentes will be a culturally competent, online professional development course to prepare promotores to support Latino parents to navigate the health care and educational systems. Puentes-trained promotores will provide Latino parents of CSHCN with the knowledge and skills to overcome barriers and advocate for their children’s academic and social success.",Online course to prepare promotores to support low-income Latino parents of children with special healthcare needs,9928746,R44MD012412,"['Anxiety ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Attitude ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cerebral Palsy ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Client ', ' Cognition ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Epilepsy ', ' Epileptic Seizures ', ' Epileptics ', ' Seizure Disorder ', ' epilepsia ', ' epileptiform ', ' epileptogenic ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Exhibits ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Feedback ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Hearing ', ' Insurance ', ' Laws ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Market Research ', ' Motivation ', ' Parents ', ' Peer Review ', ' Planning Theory ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publishing ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' sound ', ' Speech ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Film ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Health Care Team ', ' Healthcare Team ', ' Medical Care Team ', ' Latino ', ' Specialist ', ' Clip ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Acquired brain injury ', ' brain damage ', ' brain-injured ', ' Brain Injuries ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Immigrant ', ' Letters ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' Intellectual disability ', ' Intellectual limitation ', ' intellectual and developmental disability ', ' Intellectual functioning disability ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' psychosocial ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Learning disability ', ' Learning Disabilities ', ' medically necessary ', ' medically necessary care ', ' Emotional ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Autism ', ' Autistic Disorder ', ' Early Infantile Autism ', ' Infantile Autism ', "" Kanner's Syndrome "", ' autistic spectrum disorder ', ' autism spectrum disorder ', ' Advocate ', ' Communication Research ', ' SBIR ', ' Small Business Innovation Research ', ' Small Business Innovation Research Grant ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Text ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' virtual ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' prototype ', ' commercialization ', ' health training ', ' Secure ', ' certificate program ', ' community building ', ' class development ', ' course material development ', ' course development ', ' class module ', ' course module ', ' E-course ', ' online curriculum ', ' online course ', ' Workforce Development ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' ']",NIMHD,"KDH RESEARCH AND COMMUNICATION, INC.",R44,2020,675895,0.148453913627966
"Ethnicity and Nativity in Cancer - Latino & Asian Enclaves: The ENCLAVE Study Project Summary/Abstract Cancer is the leading cause of death for Latinos and Asian Americans, who are among the fastest growing populations in the U.S. A large proportion of Latinos and Asian Americans live in ethnic enclaves—distinct neighborhoods with high concentrations of individuals of the same ethnic origin (“co-ethnic residents”) that are also characterized by recent immigration and linguistic isolation. The existing literature is mixed, with some studies showing that ethnic enclave residence (vs. non-enclave residence) and foreign- (vs. U.S.-) birthplace are associated with both better and/or worse outcomes across the cancer continuum. In this study, we will pool cancer registry data across five states (CA, FL, NJ, NY, TX) comprising the majority of Latinos and Asian Americans in the U.S. and link these data to contextual data characterizing the social, built and healthcare environments. We will determine whether and how ethnic enclave residence and foreign-birthplace are associated with three cancer outcomes (incidence, stage at diagnosis, survival) experienced by nine of the largest Latino and Asian ethnic groups (Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, South Asian, Vietnamese) diagnosed with three cancer types (breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers). Specifically, we aim to define and characterize ethnic enclaves, and examine cancer incidence by enclave residence (Aim 1) and determine independent and joint associations of ethnic enclave residence and nativity (foreign vs. US birthplace) on stage at diagnosis (Aim 2) as well as on mortality (Aim 3). With over 200,000 Latino and Asian American breast, colorectal, and cervical cancer cases, we will use multilevel models to understand the impact of ethnic enclaves on cancer outcomes for these understudied populations. In doing so, our study will accelerate discovery about the intersections between neighborhoods, ethnicity, nativity, and cancer and will improve data and methods used by central cancer registries across the U.S. Findings have potential to inform development of multilevel interventions to leverage enclave attributes that promote health and to address any barriers to reduce disparities and improve outcomes for our fastest growing ethnic minority and immigrant communities. We will disseminate our enclave measure and imputation procedures for missing data to the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). In doing so, our methods will improve completeness of cancer registry data for surveillance of the growing Latino and Asian American populations. Our dissemination plan with collaboration from NAACCR leadership as well as the Offices of Community Outreach and Engagement at NCI Designated Cancer Centers in five states will ensure 1) methods are readily adopted by cancer registries and health disparities researchers across the nation; and 2) findings inform community-engaged efforts to address multilevel cancer disparities among Latino and Asian populations. Project Narrative Cancer is the leading cause of death for Latino and Asian ethnic groups, who are among the fastest growing U.S. populations. In this study we will pool cancer registry data across five states containing the majority of these populations and link to contextual data to determine which patients live inside ethnic enclaves—distinct neighborhoods with high concentrations of individuals of the same ethnic origin (“co-ethnic residents”), linguistically isolated residents, and immigrants. We will study the relationship among ethnic enclaves, patient nativity (U.S.- or foreign-born) and cancer incidence, stage at diagnosis, survival for three cancer types (breast, cervix, colorectal) for Asian Americans and Latinos, with attention to the 9 major ethnic groups (Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, South Asian and Vietnamese).",Ethnicity and Nativity in Cancer - Latino & Asian Enclaves: The ENCLAVE Study,9885937,R01CA237540,"['Asian Americans ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Breast ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervix Uteri ', ' Cervix ', ' Uterine Cervix ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immigration ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York ', ' Patients ', ' Population Growth ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' Businesses ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Latino ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' residential building ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Mexican ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Immigrant ', ' Koreans ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' colo-rectal ', ' colorectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' American ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' cancer registry ', ' neoplasm registry ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' response ', ' cancer location ', ' cancer site ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' social capital ', ' Data ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Stage at Diagnosis ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Control Science ', ' Cancer Control ', ' South Asian ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' evidence base ', ' population based ', ' surveillance data ', ' data registry ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' improved outcome ', ' Cuban ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,629237,0.03670091090888825
"Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K01 proposal is to develop a culturally tailored nutrition communication intervention for primary prevention of breast cancer among bicultural Latinas. The overarching goal of the study is to advance understanding of how communication and acculturation processes influence cancer risk behaviors in order to design effective culturally tailored interventions to reduce cancer risk behaviors. This approach is particularly relevant when considering research on the health of the population of CA's San Joaquin Valley (SJV). A vast, largely rural region that produces over half of the nation's fruit, nuts, and vegetables, SJV is 50% Latino, mostly of Mexican origin6. The SJV has a very diverse Latino population: 25% are foreign-born, and their primary language may be an indigenous Mexican language rather than Spanish, while 75% are native-born U.S. citizens, who possess varied fluency in English abilities and whose families may include both legal and undocumented immigrants. The linguistic and acculturative diversity of this population poses new challenges for understanding how to design effective behavior change interventions. Most community-based interventions with Latinos have focused on those who speak Spanish exclusively, limiting our understanding of how acculturation and linguistic diversity impact communication intervention design and effectiveness. mHealth strategies offer a way of delivering interventions that are not only culturally appropriate for Latinos across the acculturation spectrum, but also appropriate for primary cancer prevention among young adults who are eager adopters of technology. This study aims to fill the knowledge gaps through a research plan designed around three sequential aims employing mixed methods for message testing and community intervention research. In Aim 1, we will conduct semi-structured interviews with SJV Latinas (N=25) to explore factors that influence diet and food preparation behaviors as well as barriers and facilitators to the adoption of healthier diets. Results will inform the content categories for message tailoring, the structure of the messages, and the means of dissemination. In Aim 2, we will use the findings from Aim 1 to build and test a library of messages that are culturally appropriate for bicultural Latinas using focus groups and cognitive interviews. Aim 3 is the design, pilot test, and evaluation of an intervention to improve diet behaviors. The intervention consists of a series of culturally appropriate messages, developed in Aim 2, tailored to each participant's needs and preferences, to be disseminated via mobile phone over a 4-week period. We will evaluate preliminary outcomes (e.g., usage and feedback about the intervention and changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behavioral intentions) at four different times. We will determine preliminary estimates of effect size for behavioral outcomes (consumption of dietary fat, fruits and vegetables), based on two post-intervention data collections. We will additionally evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and sustainability in order to refine the intervention for a future larger randomized controlled trial, to be proposed in an R01 application before the end of this award. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The demographic and risk factor profiles for Latinos suggest a looming cancer epidemic: Latinos are younger, poorer, and less likely to have access to cancer screening than the general population. The ""Acculturation Paradox"" further suggests that acculturation is a risk factor for diet-related breast cancer risk. This project aims to improve eating behaviors as a primary cancer prevention strategy, and the emphasis on young adult, bicultural Latinas focuses on those at high preventable cancer risk. The overall goals of this career development grant are to improve understanding of (a) factors that influence Latinas' cancer-related behaviors that may be modifiable through communication-based strategies, and (b) factors that influence Latinas' communication preferences and intervention effectiveness, in order to inform a culturally appropriate mHealth intervention.",Breast Cancer Prevention mHealth Intervention for Rural Latinas,9955189,K01CA190659,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' dietary lipid ', ' Epidemic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Fruit ', ' dietary fruit ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Libraries ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' nutrition ', ' Nuts ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Native-Born ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Native People ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Mexican ', ' Rural ', ' mammary cancer prevention ', ' mammary tumor prevention ', ' prevent breast cancer ', ' Breast Cancer Prevention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Cancer Prevention Intervention ', ' Immigrant ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' behavior change ', ' preference ', ' cancer risk ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Categories ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modality ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' career development ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' food preparation ', ' Latinas ', ' Latina ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Legal ', ' breast cancer risk ', ' Breast Cancer Risk Factor ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Indigenous ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Cause ', ' Cancer Etiology ', ' Primary Cancer Prevention ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Consumption ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' tailored messaging ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile computing ', ' eat less ', ' reduced eating ', ' reduced food intake ', ' ethnic identity ', ' cognitive interview ', ' ']",NCI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, MERCED",K01,2020,126055,0.023015295420747706
"Self-regulation development and the transition to middle school Self-regulation and the transition to middle school  The transition from elementary to middle school often precipitates a downward spiral in academic performance characterized by declining grades, academic disengagement, and eventual high school drop-out. During this same period, risky behaviors such as substance abuse and sexual risk-taking increase. Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition. Disentangling the factors contributing to the academic success/failure of low-income African American and Latino youth requires viewing development as a complex developmental process with “intertwined developmental trajectories, social pathways, and social convoys” (Benner, 2011). For low-income African American and Latino youth in particular, it is important to consider the intersection of social class, culture, and ethnicity for children of color transitioning to middle school. Life course theory suggests that early life stress can have a cumulative effect on development. Accordingly, individual level vulnerabilities at multiple levels of the youth ecology (individual, family, school, and neighborhood) can be potentiated during times of exposure to additional normative stressors, such as developmental transition points. Minority youth from low-SES families not only experience difficulties associated with poverty but also cultural stress (e.g., assimilation, discrimination) which undermine their ability to face normative stressors such as transitioning into middle school.  We propose to follow a large cohort of low-income African American and Latino children first enrolled at age 2½ as part of the Dallas Preschool Readiness Project (DPReP) as they transition into middle school. DPReP participants have completed four waves of data collection that have included measures of emerging self- regulation skills, academic achievement, and behavior problems. By following this sample into middle school, we will characterize trajectories of self-regulation development to address the following primary aims: Aim 1. Examine how individual differences in trajectories of self-regulation development from 2½ years into  middle school are related to differences in academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school for  low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 2. Examine how the interrelated contexts of family, school and neighborhood contribute to the middle  school academic and behavioral adjustment of low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 3. Examine how the relation of family, school, and neighborhood contexts to academic and behavioral  adjustment in middle school is both mediated and moderated by self-regulation skills among low-  income African Americans and Latinos. Data collection methods will include home visits, phone interviews, teacher surveys, and classroom and neighborhood observations. Measures include child self-regulation, assessments of academic performance and social competence, family environment, classroom environment, teacher-child relationship, and neighborhood conditions. Analytic methods will include structural equations modeling, and latent differences models. Project Narrative The transition from elementary to middle school often precipitates a downward spiral in academic performance characterized by declining grades, academic disengagement, and eventual high school drop-out. Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition, and the stark race/ethnic disparities in high school graduation rates and educational attainment likely reflect its long- term consequences. Children with better self-regulation in early childhood display better academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school. In this study, we will follow a cohort of 365 low-income African American and Latino children originally enrolled at age 2½ and reassessed at age 3½, kindergarten, and first grade to conduct additional assessments in 4th through 7th grade to examine the role of self-regulation skills, family-level processes and neighborhood conditions in explaining academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school.",Self-regulation development and the transition to middle school,9952392,R01HD075311,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Buffers ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Methods ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' pre-k ', ' pre-kindergarten ', ' preschool ', ' Social Class ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Student Dropouts ', ' School Dropouts ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Assimilations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' analytical method ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' teacher ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Exposure to ', ' Complex ', ' 1st grade ', ' first grade ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' early childhood ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Transact ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' 7th grade ', ' seventh grade ', ' interpersonal competence ', ' interpersonal competency ', ' social competence ', ' social competency ', ' social skills ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' junior high ', ' middle school ', ' junior high school ', ' kindergarten ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Developmental Process ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Family Process ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' critical period ', ' early adolescence ', ' sexual risk taking ', ' Junior High School Student ', ' Junior High Student ', ' Middle School Student ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' classroom environment ', ' college atmosphere ', ' collegial atmosphere ', ' collegiate atmosphere ', ' education atmosphere ', ' educational environment ', ' intellectual atmosphere ', ' learning atmosphere ', ' learning environment ', ' school atmosphere ', ' training atmosphere ', ' university atmosphere ', ' educational atmosphere ', ' Attainment Rate ', ' Graduation Rates ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnic identity ', ' early life stress ', ' social structural ', ' socio-structural ', ' sociostructural ', ' social structure ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2020,585914,0.050536777385074325
"Exito Latino Cancer Research Leadership Training Summary/Abstract for Submission 5R25 CA 134301-10 Administrative Supplement PA18-591. As detailed in the budget justification section of this administrative supplement application, due to COVID-19 pandemic impact, we have incurred unanticipated costs within the scope of the current grant. It is important to note that the specific aims of the approved project have not changed. What has changed, however, is the timing of the training activities as well as the necessary support to see the program through to its completion. In this the 10th and final year of our program, we have been unable to conduct our June 2020 Summer Institute (SI) due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, the unanticipated duration and continual impact from the COVID-19 pandemic has forced an unforeseen delay with associated expenses, from June 2020 as originally approved to one calendar year later, June 2021. To complete the originally stated and approved goals during this last year of the program we need support to finish the important work of our program. In this first 9 years, our Éxito! program has been extremely successful. Since 2010, Éxito! has graduated 200 alumni of the SI, 27% (53) of whom are currently enrolled in doctoral programs, and 11 have already graduated. Project Narrative for Submission 5R25 CA 134301-10 Administrative Supplement PA18-591. Americans of Latino descent are the most underrepresented in doctoral programs and careers in cancer control research. The Éxito! program is working to increase the number of master's-level Latino individuals who go on to successfully attain doctoral degrees and become leaders in cancer control research. Due to COVID-19 pandemic impact, we have incurred unanticipated costs within the scope of the current grant. The timing of the training activities and the necessary support to maintain the program to its completion have had to be delayed. Thus, we are requesting in this administrative supplement the funds necessary to finish this last year of this grant and to complete the originally stated and approved goals.",Exito Latino Cancer Research Leadership Training,10205708,R25CA134301,"['recruit ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' Budgets ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' Internships ', ' intern ', ' Leadership ', ' Motivation ', ' Persons ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Students ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' career ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Address ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Doctorate Degree ', ' doctoral degree ', "" Doctor's Degree "", ' Calendar ', ' Cancer Control Research ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cost ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' health training ', ' summer institute ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS HLTH SCIENCE CENTER,R25,2020,119952,0.04792474462019719
