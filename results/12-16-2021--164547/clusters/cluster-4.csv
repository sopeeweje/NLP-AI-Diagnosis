"Impact of Pancreas-Kidney Transplants on Renal Allograft DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Simultaneous pancreas kidney transplantation (SPK) is an increasingly common treatment option for patients with end-stage renal disease due to Type I diabetes (DM). Recent studies suggest SPK may improve kidney allograft survival compared to kidney transplantation alone (KA). However, patient selection may account for this disparity since patient sociodemographics and comorbidities likely impact consideration for SPK. The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of patient selection on access to SPK versus KA and to determine the impact of SPK on renal allograft survival. In order to avoid selection bias, the comparison of renal allograft survival between SPK and KA recipients will be limited to patients waitlisted for SPK: approximately 10 percent of patients listed for SPK receive a KA due a fatty or traumatized pancreas allograft, or availability of a zero-antigen mismatch kidney alone. The USRDS has collected comorbidity data since April 1995. To assess the impact of patient selection on access to SPK we will use these national data to conduct a cross-sectional study of DM patients waitlisted for either SPK or KA after April 1995. We will compare patient socioeconomic demographics, comorbidities, and transplant center characteristics between these two groups. Logistic regression will be used to identify independent determinants of access to SPK. To determine the impact of SPK on renal allograft survival, we will conduct a retrospective cohort study of all patients waitlisted for SPK and transplanted with SPK or KA after April 1995. Renal allograft survival in SPK and KA will be compared using Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for patient and transplant center characteristics.

"Research Center to Reduce Ethnic Disparities in ESRD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substantial racial/ethnic disparities exist in the area of renal health. Minority groups are more than 50% of all persons on the waiting list for a kidney transplant in the United States. Yet, because minorities donate organs at a rate that reflects their representation in the population, the shortage of kidneys for minorities with End-Stage Renal Disease has reached crisis proportions. Such trends suggest that in addition to conducting research that can better define the correlates and causes of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney transplantation rates research is also needed to identify psychosocial and psychoneuroimmunological factors that contribute to poorer health outcomes. The findings can be exported to the design of prevention campaigns and that can efficaciously reduce the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, poor nutrition and inadequate exercise, and licit and illicit substance use among minorities. The Howard University Project Export Center of Renal Health will be structured to serve as an institutionalized and permanent research center that will complete research and test interventions and practices that can reduce current racial/ethnic differentials in renal health.

"Nitric oxide in systemic lupus erythematosus  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease marked by autoantibody production, glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. The etiology of SLE is unknown, although a genetic predisposition coupled with an environmental trigger appear necessary for the development of disease. SLE occurs 3-4 times more often in African Americans than Caucasians and African Americans with lupus have greater morbidity and mortality primarily due to renal disease. We demonstrated higher nitric oxide (NO) production in patients with lupus compared to controls, that NO production correlates with disease activity, that polymorphisms in the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS) are linked with disease in African American females and that African Americans, produce more NO than Caucasians. Our hypothesis is that NO is a pathogenic factor in SLE and that differential production of NO plays a role in the ethnic disparity in lupus. To address this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 A. Assay systemic NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) production in humans with SLE as an indicator of disease activity. Determine whether the association between NO and disease activity is evident in specific SLE subsets B. To assess potential mechanisms for NO pathogenesis in disease, we will measure renal eicosanoid/isoprostane excretion in parallel with NO measures. C. Assess in vitro effects of NO on eicosanoid production by PBMCs from lupus patients and controls. D. Assess renal expression of iNOS in renal biopsies from lupus patients correlating expression with renal outcome.   Aim 2 A. Using the unique Carolina lupus (CLU) cohort, determine the association of lupus and specific disease manifestations/progression with polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the iNOS, eNOS and nNOS genes. B. Confirm the association of iNOS polymorphisms with lupus by TDT analysis of African American families from the Oklahoma Lupus Registry. C. Determine if there are differences in NO production/iNOS expression by stimulated PBMCs between SLE patients and controls with and without the NOS polymorphisms.   Aim 3  A. Determine the mechanism for renal disease expression in MRL/lpr iNOS knockout mice compared to wild type MRL/lpr mice and MRL/lpr mice treated with iNOS inhibitors B. Assess effects of specific and nonspecific inhibitors of iNOS production on disease presentation in iNOS knockout MRL/lpr mice. C.

"ACCESS TO CARE AND SURVIVAL OF RENAL ALLOGRAFTS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recipient race is associated with renal allograft survival. Rates of allograft loss are approximately 1.5 to 2-fold higher among African-Americans compared with other racial groups. It is not clear whether genetic, immunologic, or other non-biological factors (e.g., racial differences in access to care) are responsible for these findings. We propose to explore the issue of race-specific allograft loss by comparing differences in early allograft outcomes (delayed graft function and acute rejection) and late allograft outcomes (5-year graft survival, graft failure defined as return to dialysis or death with a functioning graft) among African-Americans in Veterans' Health Administration (VHA) and non-VHA settings. While biological differences are present across practice sites, access to care is more uniform within the VHA. We will examine the associations of demographic, clinical, socioeconomic, dialysis and transplant related variables with outcomes. Analyses using conventional regression analyses (e.g., logistic and proportional hazards regression) and the marginal structural model will be performed. Given the scarcity of organs for transplantation, it is of paramount importance to ensure that graft dysfunction does not result from differences in access to care. This study will help define the contribution of access to care in racial differences in renal transplant outcomes.

"TGF-Beta, Glucose and Nephropathy in African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of end stage renal disease (ESRD), which is largely due to diabetes and hypertension, has increased markedly. African Americans, who experience more diabetes and hypertension, suffer excessive rates of ESRD. The goal of this project is to detect early markers of nephropathy in a cohort of young adult African American men and women. The project is based on the concept that oxidative stress activates aberrant regulatory pathways to renal and vessel injury. Hypertension and diabetes are two disorders that induce oxidative stress from increased blood pressure (BP) and from hyperglycemia. Our preliminary data indicate that early changes in glucose tolerance may activate factors that contribute to tissue injury. Pilot data show that urinary excretion of F2 isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, and the tissue cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Beta) increase markedly following modest hyperglycemia. The vasoactive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) is higher and urinary excretion of TGF-Beta is greater in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) compared to those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). To examine the oxidative stress concept this project is designed to test the hypothesis: Relative hyperglycemia, emanating from insulin resistance with deterioration in glucose tolerance, imposes oxidative stress to renal tissue and mediates an increase in activity of TGF-Beta and ET-1, with resultant renal tissue injury expressed by an increase in urinary albumin excretion (UAE). Our specific aims are to 1) Verify the change in glucose tolerance within a previously examined African American cohort now aged 38-43 years; 2) Determine if markers of oxidative stress can be detected in this cohort; 3) Determine if there is increased expression of TGF-Band ET-1 that is linked with deterioration in glucose tolerance; and 4) Determine if evidence of renal tissue injury (UAE) corresponds with F2 isoprostane excretion, TGF-B activity or ET-1 activity. We will reexamine a well characterized cohort of African American men and women. Measurements include an oral glucose tolerance test and assays for F2 isoprostane, TGF-Beta, ET-1, and UAE. In addition to analysis of newly obtained data, we will also utilize the previously obtained data from this cohort to test the overall theoretical model. The advantage of longitudinal assessment enables us to identify specific parameters that are predictive of an accelerated pathway for renal disease. The results of this project may contribute to improved methods for early detection and prevention of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes, as well as the development of more specific therapeutic targets for this high risk minority population.

"Smoking and Chronic Kidney Disease: Dose Race Matter? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and who require dialysis is growing rapidly. Twenty million people suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the US and are at risk for ESRD with African Americans (AA) at a much higher risk for CKD and ESRD than Caucasians (C). Cigarette smoking is a modifiable risk factor for ESRD and given the racial disparity in ESRD, it is plausible that AA may be more susceptible to renal injury from smoking than C. The study proposes to examine the associations between smoking and kidney disease and to what extent the injurious renal effects of this exposure varies by race. Existing databases will be used to examine the effect of smoking on the progression of CKD and the incidence of ESRD as it differs by race. Persons with CKD will be enrolled in a study to examine the dose dependent association between cigarette smoking and renal injury across racial groups. Focus groups will explore the awareness of the association between kidney disease and smoking and barriers to smoking cessation as they differ by race. The expected findings are that smoking has a more damaging renal effect on AA relative to C, and in this way contributes to the wide disparity in ESRD incidence rates between races.

This proposal is a renewal application for the NIH-NIDDK-funded Family Investigation of Diabetes and Nephropathy (FIND), an ongoing multicenter study to identify susceptibility genes for nephropathy.

Our central hypothesis is that some renal disease susceptibility alleles are present at higher frequency in African-Americans than in whites and that specific regions of the genome in African-Americans contain marker alleles that are in admixture linkage disequilibrium with ESRD susceptibility alleles.   MALD is a specialized form of linkage disequilibrium mapping and will be used to perform a genome-wide association study in approximately 1,500 African-American cases and 1,300 African-American controls from FIND and 250 similarly phenotyped African-American cases from the CHOICE study, also funded by NIH-NIDDK. In this proposal, we are requesting funds to recruit an additional 300 ESRD cases and 300 controls without renal disease to achieve a final sample size of approximately 3,000 cases and controls.   The Johns Hopkins center differs from other FIND centers which use either a family-based linkage approach or MALD in Mexican Americans.

"Renal Disease in Minority Populations and Developing Nations Conference Grant DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science proposes to co-sponsor ""Renal Disease in Minority Populations and Developing Nations,"" a satellite conference to the WCN. The meeting will focus on renal disease in minority populations and developing nations with carefully selected global participants and abstract presentations by junior investigators. Main topics will include etiology and prevalence of chronic kidney disease and end stage renal disease, as well as their main causes and complications. The conference will focus on innovative cost effective prevention and early treatment strategies. This symposium stems from the growing problem of progressive renal disease among racial and ethnic minorities and developing countries. The proceedings of similar symposia (2001, 2003), which were official satellite conferences to the annual American Society of Nephrology meetings, were the subject of Kidney International journal supplements (Volume 63, 2003 and under preparation).  The overarching goal is to develop a symposium where kidney specialists discuss the burgeoning problems that beset racial and ethnic minority groups worldwide as related to progressive renal disease and its complications. The symposium will allow presentation and discussion of epidemiological, clinical, and basic science advances by a diverse international panel. This will foster interdisciplinary approaches to overcoming critical roadblocks and knowledge gaps that constrain rapid advances in biomedical and clinical research progress from a global perspective. This application has four specific aims:  Specific Aim 1: To provide increased access for junior investigators to a symposium focusing on the prevention of kidney disease in minority groups and emerging nations as a satellite to the WCN meeting;  Specific Aim 2: To cultivate junior investigators' involvement in studies regarding the relationship between kidney disease and minority groups/emerging nations;  Specific Aim 3: To increase knowledge transfer around diverse innovative strategies to increase prevention of chronic kidney disease in minority groups and emerging nations; and  Specific Aim 4: To develop and publish a supplement that comprises of articles from each of the speakers at the symposium for the journal Kidney International.

"Smoking and Chronic Kidney Disease: Dose Race Matter? DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The number of Americans with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and who require dialysis is growing rapidly. Twenty million people suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the US and are at risk for ESRD with African Americans (AA) at a much higher risk for CKD and ESRD than Caucasians (C). Cigarette smoking is a modifiable risk factor for ESRD and given the racial disparity in ESRD, it is plausible that AA may be more susceptible to renal injury from smoking than C. The study proposes to examine the associations between smoking and kidney disease and to what extent the injurious renal effects of this exposure varies by race. Existing databases will be used to examine the effect of smoking on the progression of CKD and the incidence of ESRD as it differs by race. Persons with CKD will be enrolled in a study to examine the dose dependent association between cigarette smoking and renal injury across racial groups. Focus groups will explore the awareness of the association between kidney disease and smoking and barriers to smoking cessation as they differ by race. The expected findings are that smoking has a more damaging renal effect on AA relative to C, and in this way contributes to the wide disparity in ESRD incidence rates between races.

"Nitric oxide in systemic lupus erythematosus  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease marked by autoantibody production, glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. The etiology of SLE is unknown, although a genetic predisposition coupled with an environmental trigger appear necessary for the development of disease. SLE occurs 3-4 times more often in African Americans than Caucasians and African Americans with lupus have greater morbidity and mortality primarily due to renal disease. We demonstrated higher nitric oxide (NO) production in patients with lupus compared to controls, that NO production correlates with disease activity, that polymorphisms in the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS) are linked with disease in African American females and that African Americans, produce more NO than Caucasians. Our hypothesis is that NO is a pathogenic factor in SLE and that differential production of NO plays a role in the ethnic disparity in lupus. To address this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 A. Assay systemic NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) production in humans with SLE as an indicator of disease activity. Determine whether the association between NO and disease activity is evident in specific SLE subsets B. To assess potential mechanisms for NO pathogenesis in disease, we will measure renal eicosanoid/isoprostane excretion in parallel with NO measures. C. Assess in vitro effects of NO on eicosanoid production by PBMCs from lupus patients and controls. D. Assess renal expression of iNOS in renal biopsies from lupus patients correlating expression with renal outcome.   Aim 2 A. Using the unique Carolina lupus (CLU) cohort, determine the association of lupus and specific disease manifestations/progression with polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the iNOS, eNOS and nNOS genes. B. Confirm the association of iNOS polymorphisms with lupus by TDT analysis of African American families from the Oklahoma Lupus Registry. C. Determine if there are differences in NO production/iNOS expression by stimulated PBMCs between SLE patients and controls with and without the NOS polymorphisms.   Aim 3  A. Determine the mechanism for renal disease expression in MRL/lpr iNOS knockout mice compared to wild type MRL/lpr mice and MRL/lpr mice treated with iNOS inhibitors B. Assess effects of specific and nonspecific inhibitors of iNOS production on disease presentation in iNOS knockout MRL/lpr mice. C. Identify the proteins that are nitrated in the renal cortex of MRL/lpr mice using a proteomics approach.

"Quality of Life Therapy for Adults with ESRD Awaiting Renal Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary: Despite known quality of life (QOL) deficits associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there have been very few attempts to develop strategies to improve QOL in adults with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation. The long-term goal of this research program is to better understand how QOL can be enhanced, to identify the mechanisms underlying QOL changes, to identify which patients benefit most from QOL intervention, and to determine whether QOL benefits can extend beyond transplantation. The objective of this application is to determine the effectiveness, feasibility and applicability of Quality of Life Therapy (QOLT) in treating adults with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation. In a recent small, single-center clinical trial, we demonstrated that QOLT can improve QOL, psychological functioning, and social intimacy in patients awaiting lung transplantation. This application seeks to examine whether this intervention can be effectively adapted and implemented with adults with ,ESRD who are awaiting renal transplantation. The central hypothesis is that by targeting improvements in specific life domains, QOLT yields significant clinical benefits in QOL, psychological functioning, and the patient-caregiver relationship. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the effectiveness of QOLT; 2) Examine the differential effectiveness of QOLT by race (White, African American); and 3) Assess the feasibility of a multisite R01 application. Under the first aim, adults with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation will be randomized to receive QOLT, Supportive Therapy (ST), or Standard Care (SC). Primary outcomes will be changes in QOL, psychological functioning, and social intimacy at 1 and 12 weeks post-treatment. Under the second aim, the relationship between race and intervention outcomes will be closely examined. Under the third aim, attrition rates, reasons for attrition, therapist adherence to treatment protocols, and participant satisfaction ratings will be gathered to assess the need for protocol changes prior to developing a larger, multisite clinical trial R01 application. This study is innovative because it is among the first to evaluate a theoretically-driven psychological intervention to specifically improve QOL in the context of ESRD and renal transplantation. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of how QOL can be improved in patients with ESRD. Relevance to Public Health: This is an important and under- investigated area. With very long waiting times to renal transplantation and the burdens associated with dialysis, effective QOL interventions can be used to improve the quality of well-being for all patients who are otherwise medically disabled and awaiting transplantation. These benefits have the potential to extend the QOL outcomes otherwise derived from transplantation alone.          ",Quality of Life Therapy for Adults with ESRD Awaiting Renal Transplantation,7216605,R21DK077322,"['clinical trial ', ' caregiver ', ' medical record ', ' human subject ', ' audiotape ', ' interview ', ' chronic renal failure ', ' kidney transplantation ', ' longitudinal human study ', ' behavior test ', ' interpersonal relations ', ' isolation /deprivation ', ' psychotherapy ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' therapy compliance ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' quality of life ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' patient oriented research ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2006,212500,0.11138002816371036
"A Research Center to Reduce Ethnic Disparities in ESRD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Substantial racial/ethnic disparities exist in the area of renal health. Minority groups are more than 50% of all persons on the waiting list for a kidney transplant in the United States. Yet, because minorities donate organs at a rate that reflects their representation in the population, the shortage of kidneys for minorities with End-Stage Renal Disease has reached crisis proportions. Such trends suggest that in addition to conducting research that can better define the correlates and causes of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney transplantation rates research is also needed to identify psychosocial and psychoneuroimmunological factors that contribute to poorer health outcomes. The findings can be exported to the design of prevention campaigns and that can efficaciously reduce the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, poor nutrition and inadequate exercise, and licit and illicit substance use among minorities. The Howard University Project Export Center of Renal Health will be structured to serve as an institutionalized and permanent research center that will complete research and test interventions and practices that can reduce current racial/ethnic differentials in renal health. The Center will be headed by Dr. Clive O. Callender, the nation's premiere kidney transplantation specialist and a pioneer in creating interventions to remedy racial/ethnic gaps in renal health.

"Kidney and Cardiovascular Disease in American Indians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Renal dysfunction and abnormalities of the cardiovascular system often occur simultaneously and may share common pathophysiology. Factors influencing progression of one disease state are thought to influence progression of the other. The Strong Heart Study (SHS) provides a unique opportunity to study changes in renal function, CVD risk factors, subclinical CVD as well as clinical events in American Indians (AI). AI are a health disparity population due to their extremely high rates of diabetes and diabetic complications. I propose to (1) perform secondary data analyses to examine the co-progression of renal and cardiovascular disease in AI in the SHS and (2) conduct a pilot study involving measurement of oxidative stress markers in relation to progression of renal and cardiovascular disease in AI. Specifically, I propose to conduct a series of cross-sectional, survival and repeated measures analyses involving glomerular filtration rate and measures of clinical (Ml, CHD) and subclinical (carotid atherosclerosis, echocardiography) cardiovascular disease to better define the co-progression of renal and CVD in AI. Further, I propose to conduct a pilot study of CVD cases and controls in which I will use stored specimens from the SHS to examine levels of F2-isoprostane and 8- hydroxyguanine, two markers of oxidative stress. Achievement of these aims, along with the other training activities described in this application, and the structured mentoring offered by Drs. Resnick and Umans will provide me with the skills, knowledge and direction that will help me begin developing a research program focused in health disparities in renal disease.

"TGF-Beta, Glucose and Nephropathy in African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The incidence of end stage renal disease (ESRD), which is largely due to diabetes and hypertension, has increased markedly. African Americans, who experience more diabetes and hypertension, suffer excessive rates of ESRD. The goal of this project is to detect early markers of nephropathy in a cohort of young adult African American men and women. The project is based on the concept that oxidative stress activates aberrant regulatory pathways to renal and vessel injury. Hypertension and diabetes are two disorders that induce oxidative stress from increased blood pressure (BP) and from hyperglycemia. Our preliminary data indicate that early changes in glucose tolerance may activate factors that contribute to tissue injury. Pilot data show that urinary excretion of F2 isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, and the tissue cytokine transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-Beta) increase markedly following modest hyperglycemia. The vasoactive peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) is higher and urinary excretion of TGF-Beta is greater in subjects with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) compared to those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). To examine the oxidative stress concept this project is designed to test the hypothesis: Relative hyperglycemia, emanating from insulin resistance with deterioration in glucose tolerance, imposes oxidative stress to renal tissue and mediates an increase in activity of TGF-Beta and ET-1, with resultant renal tissue injury expressed by an increase in urinary albumin excretion (UAE). Our specific aims are to 1) Verify the change in glucose tolerance within a previously examined African American cohort now aged 38-43 years; 2) Determine if markers of oxidative stress can be detected in this cohort; 3) Determine if there is increased expression of TGF-Band ET-1 that is linked with deterioration in glucose tolerance; and 4) Determine if evidence of renal tissue injury (UAE) corresponds with F2 isoprostane excretion, TGF-B activity or ET-1 activity. We will reexamine a well characterized cohort of African American men and women. Measurements include an oral glucose tolerance test and assays for F2 isoprostane, TGF-Beta, ET-1, and UAE. In addition to analysis of newly obtained data, we will also utilize the previously obtained data from this cohort to test the overall theoretical model. The advantage of longitudinal assessment enables us to identify specific parameters that are predictive of an accelerated pathway for renal disease. The results of this project may contribute to improved methods for early detection and prevention of nephropathy due to type 2 diabetes, as well as the development of more specific therapeutic targets for this high risk minority population.

"A Targeted Approach to Increasing American Indian Tissue and Organ Donation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Renal transplantation is associated with a better quality of life, lower costs, and longer life expectancy than long-term dialysis. Yet, despite the generally higher prevalence end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among minority populations in the U.S., racial/ethnic disparities in access to care, appropriateness of recipients, and rates of kidney donation and transplantation have all been reported. More specifically, the prevalence of treated ESRD among American Indians (Als) is 3.5 times greater than that of Whites and results, overwhelming, from an excess of diabetes. Using incidence rates with Whites as the reference, the rate ratio of ESRD attributable to diabetes in Als is over 5.0. Additionally, the mean age of onset of ESRD among Als is 6 years younger than among their White counterparts. These statistics speak to an epidemic of ESRD among Als in the next decades. In this project, we will mount a multi-pronged program on ESRD and organ donation at 7 Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains. These states are primarily rural, contain medically underserved areas, and have large populations of Als. Because students are among those most likely to donate organs, TCUs offer the possibly of reaching a young, educated, and disease-free population of Als - features which make them desirable to approach about donation. To understand our target population's knowledge and attitudes regarding donation, we will conduct focus groups, then develop culturally appropriate educational materials (brochures, posters) to distribute at TCUs and surrounding communities. We will also create an on-line course on chronic diseases and ESRD, underscoring the need for kidney donation. Our specific aims are to 1) examine knowledge and attitudes regarding kidney donation and transplantation among Als at 7 large TCUs in Washington, Montana, and North Dakota; 2) collaborate with students and faculty to develop culturally tailored educational and media materials to heighten awareness of the need for donation and benefits of transplantation among TCU students and surrounding tribal communities; and 3) increase number of Als who consent to donate organs as documented by signed donor cards. Given the striking rates of diabetes and poverty among Als and rural location of most reservations, and the dearth of Al donors, we need understand views on organ donation. More importantly, we need to use this information to increase actual donation rates in this neglected minority.          ",A Targeted Approach to Increasing American Indian Tissue and Organ Donation,7337411,R01DK079670,"['Commit ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Physical Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Institution ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Epidemic ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Reservations ', ' Other Resources ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Faculty ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' urban area ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Incidence ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Rural ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Montana ', ' Persons ', ' Organ Donations ', ' North Dakota ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Pamphlets ', ' Brochures ', ' Booklets ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Staging ', ' Transplanted tissue ', ' Graft Material ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Population ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' statistics ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Translating ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Washington ', ' Wyoming ', ' Awareness ', ' Location ', ' Class ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Donor Card ', ' Generations ', ' Native-Born ', ' Native People ', ' Indigenous Population ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Academic Training ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' neglect ', ' Minority ', ' tribal community ', ' tribal communities ', ' tribal leader ', ' northern plains ', ' tribal college ', ' tribal university ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R01,2007,193939,0.05732309366481649
"A genetic analysis of non-diabetic end stage renal disease in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have a four-fold higher incidence rate of end stage renal disease (ESRD) relative to European Americans. This racial disparity is not fully accounted for by differences in socioeconomic status, access to medical care or control of hypertension. Additionally, familial aggregation studies indicate a strong genetic component to predisposition to ESRD. These observations suggest that an inherited susceptibility to ESRD is present. While diabetes associated ESRD is the leading individual cause of ESRD, it should be noted that more than half of all ESRD cases are not associated with diabetes. The goal of this proposal is to identify genes associated with non-diabetic ESRD in African Americans. A previous genome-wide scan of African Americans with non-diabetic ESRD showed evidence for linkage at three chromosomal regions, Ch13q13.1, Ch13q33.3, and Ch1q25.1. These regions will be investigated as part of the following Specific Aims. 1. Candidate genes in these regions will be selected based on known functional activity, subjected to high density SNP analysis, and tested for association with non-diabetic ESRD in a case-control design. 2. A dense SNP map of the most promising region, Ch13q33.3, will be completed to refine linkage peaks and prioritize regions into haplotype blocks for positional cloning of candidate genes. 3. Positional candidate genes in the haplotype blocks defined by Specific Aim 2 will be identified and tested for association with ESRD using high density SNP analysis. Associated regions will be sequenced to determine the specific genetic polymorphism contributing to ESRD susceptibility. The completion of these Specific Aims will result in the identification of one or more genes that are associated with susceptibility to non-diabetic ESRD in African Americans. The Medicare costs associated with ESRD are substantial and the personal cost to patients and their families is immeasurable.

"Nitric oxide in systemic lupus erythematosus  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multisystem autoimmune disease marked by autoantibody production, glomerulonephritis, and vasculitis. The etiology of SLE is unknown, although a genetic predisposition coupled with an environmental trigger appear necessary for the development of disease. SLE occurs 3-4 times more often in African Americans than Caucasians and African Americans with lupus have greater morbidity and mortality primarily due to renal disease. We demonstrated higher nitric oxide (NO) production in patients with lupus compared to controls, that NO production correlates with disease activity, that polymorphisms in the inducible nitric oxide synthase gene (iNOS) are linked with disease in African American females and that African Americans, produce more NO than Caucasians. Our hypothesis is that NO is a pathogenic factor in SLE and that differential production of NO plays a role in the ethnic disparity in lupus. To address this hypothesis, the following specific aims are proposed: Aim 1 A. Assay systemic NO and peroxynitrite (ONOO-) production in humans with SLE as an indicator of disease activity. Determine whether the association between NO and disease activity is evident in specific SLE subsets B. To assess potential mechanisms for NO pathogenesis in disease, we will measure renal eicosanoid/isoprostane excretion in parallel with NO measures. C. Assess in vitro effects of NO on eicosanoid production by PBMCs from lupus patients and controls. D. Assess renal expression of iNOS in renal biopsies from lupus patients correlating expression with renal outcome.   Aim 2 A. Using the unique Carolina lupus (CLU) cohort, determine the association of lupus and specific disease manifestations/progression with polymorphisms in the promoter regions of the iNOS, eNOS and nNOS genes. B. Confirm the association of iNOS polymorphisms with lupus by TDT analysis of African American families from the Oklahoma Lupus Registry. C. Determine if there are differences in NO production/iNOS expression by stimulated PBMCs between SLE patients and controls with and without the NOS polymorphisms.   Aim 3  A. Determine the mechanism for renal disease expression in MRL/lpr iNOS knockout mice compared to wild type MRL/lpr mice and MRL/lpr mice treated with iNOS inhibitors B. Assess effects of specific and nonspecific inhibitors of iNOS production on disease presentation in iNOS knockout MRL/lpr mice. C. Identify the proteins that are nitrated in the renal cortex of MRL/lpr mice using a proteomics approach.

"Quality of Life Therapy for Adults with ESRD Awaiting Renal Transplantation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary: Despite known quality of life (QOL) deficits associated with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), there have been very few attempts to develop strategies to improve QOL in adults with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation. The long-term goal of this research program is to better understand how QOL can be enhanced, to identify the mechanisms underlying QOL changes, to identify which patients benefit most from QOL intervention, and to determine whether QOL benefits can extend beyond transplantation. The objective of this application is to determine the effectiveness, feasibility and applicability of Quality of Life Therapy (QOLT) in treating adults with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation. In a recent small, single-center clinical trial, we demonstrated that QOLT can improve QOL, psychological functioning, and social intimacy in patients awaiting lung transplantation. This application seeks to examine whether this intervention can be effectively adapted and implemented with adults with ,ESRD who are awaiting renal transplantation. The central hypothesis is that by targeting improvements in specific life domains, QOLT yields significant clinical benefits in QOL, psychological functioning, and the patient-caregiver relationship. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Determine the effectiveness of QOLT; 2) Examine the differential effectiveness of QOLT by race (White, African American); and 3) Assess the feasibility of a multisite R01 application. Under the first aim, adults with ESRD awaiting renal transplantation will be randomized to receive QOLT, Supportive Therapy (ST), or Standard Care (SC). Primary outcomes will be changes in QOL, psychological functioning, and social intimacy at 1 and 12 weeks post-treatment. Under the second aim, the relationship between race and intervention outcomes will be closely examined. Under the third aim, attrition rates, reasons for attrition, therapist adherence to treatment protocols, and participant satisfaction ratings will be gathered to assess the need for protocol changes prior to developing a larger, multisite clinical trial R01 application. This study is innovative because it is among the first to evaluate a theoretically-driven psychological intervention to specifically improve QOL in the context of ESRD and renal transplantation. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of how QOL can be improved in patients with ESRD. Relevance to Public Health: This is an important and under- investigated area. With very long waiting times to renal transplantation and the burdens associated with dialysis, effective QOL interventions can be used to improve the quality of well-being for all patients who are otherwise medically disabled and awaiting transplantation. These benefits have the potential to extend the QOL outcomes otherwise derived from transplantation alone.          ",Quality of Life Therapy for Adults with ESRD Awaiting Renal Transplantation,7295790,R21DK077322,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Physical Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Environment ', ' End Point ', ' Caring ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Clinical Services ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Glomerulonephritis ', ' Heymann Nephritis ', ' Bright Disease ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Incidence ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Polycystic Kidney Diseases ', ' Polycystic Kidney ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Lung Transplantation ', ' Lung Grafting ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Phase III Clinical Trials ', ' phase III trial ', ' phase III protocol ', ' phase 3 trial ', ' Phase 3 Clinical Trials ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Supportive care ', ' Supportive Therapy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Social Workers ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Week ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Score ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Outcome Study ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' intimate behavior ', ' intimacy ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' psychological distress ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Social Functioning ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' ']",NIDDK,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R21,2007,247605,0.11138002816371036
"A Targeted Approach to Increasing American Indian Tissue and Organ Donation Renal transplantation is associated with a better quality of life, lower costs, and longer life expectancy than long-term dialysis. Yet, despite the generally higher prevalence end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among minority populations in the U.S.,racial/ethnic disparities in access to care, appropriateness of recipients, and rates of kidney donation and transplantation have all been reported. More specifically, the prevalence of treated ESRD among American Indians (Als) is 3.5 times greater than that of Whites and results, overwhelming, from an excess of diabetes. Using incidence rates with Whites as the reference, the rate ratio of ESRD attributable to diabetes in Als is over 5.0.Additionally, the mean age of onset of ESRD among Als is 6 years younger than among their White counterparts. These statistics speak to an epidemic of ESRD among Als in the next decades. In this project, we will mount a multi-pronged program on ESRD and organ donation at 7 Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains. These states are primarily rural, contain medically underserved areas, and have large populations of Als. Because students are among those most likely to donate organs, TCUs offer the possibly of reaching a young, educated, and disease-free population of Als - features which make them desirable to approach about donation. To understand our target population's knowledge and attitudes regarding donation, we will conduct focus groups, then develop culturally appropriate educational materials (brochures, posters) to distribute at TCUs and surrounding communities. We will also create an on-line course on chronic diseases and ESRD, underscoring the need for kidney donation. Our specific aims are to 1) examine knowledge and attitudes regarding kidney donation and transplantation among Als at 7 large TCUs in Washington, Montana, and North Dakota; 2) collaborate with students and faculty to develop culturally tailored educational and media materials to heighten awareness of the need for donation and benefits of transplantation among TCU students and surrounding tribal communities; and 3) increase number of Als who consent to donate organs as documented by signed donor cards. Given the striking rates of diabetes and poverty among Als and rural location of most reservations, and the dearth of Al donors, we need understand views on organ donation. More importantly, we need to use this information to increase actual donation rates in this neglected minority.

"A genetic analysis of non-diabetic end stage renal disease in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have a four-fold higher incidence rate of end stage renal disease (ESRD) relative to European Americans. This racial disparity is not fully accounted for by differences in socioeconomic status, access to medical care or control of hypertension. Additionally, familial aggregation studies indicate a strong genetic component to predisposition to ESRD. These observations suggest that an inherited susceptibility to ESRD is present. While diabetes associated ESRD is the leading individual cause of ESRD, it should be noted that more than half of all ESRD cases are not associated with diabetes. The goal of this proposal is to identify genes associated with non-diabetic ESRD in African Americans. A previous genome-wide scan of African Americans with non-diabetic ESRD showed evidence for linkage at three chromosomal regions, Ch13q13.1, Ch13q33.3, and Ch1q25.1. These regions will be investigated as part of the following Specific Aims. 1. Candidate genes in these regions will be selected based on known functional activity, subjected to high density SNP analysis, and tested for association with non-diabetic ESRD in a case-control design. 2. A dense SNP map of the most promising region, Ch13q33.3, will be completed to refine linkage peaks and prioritize regions into haplotype blocks for positional cloning of candidate genes. 3. Positional candidate genes in the haplotype blocks defined by Specific Aim 2 will be identified and tested for association with ESRD using high density SNP analysis. Associated regions will be sequenced to determine the specific genetic polymorphism contributing to ESRD susceptibility. The completion of these Specific Aims will result in the identification of one or more genes that are associated with susceptibility to non-diabetic ESRD in African Americans. The Medicare costs associated with ESRD are substantial and the personal cost to patients and their families is immeasurable. Despite the increased risk of non-diabetic ESRD among African Americans, limited research has been carried out targeted at understanding genetic susceptibility to non-diabetic ESRD. This research proposal is aimed at specifically identifying genes that are associated with susceptibility to non-diabetic ESRD.

"Response to Medicare Reimbursement Policy Change by Minority and All ESRD Patient    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately impacted by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) based upon disease prevalence, access to transplantation among diagnosed ESRD patients, and health outcomes. The Social Security Amendments of 1972 entitled almost all patients with ESRD in the United States to Medicare-funded renal transplantation, but limited coverage of post-transplant care to 1 year. Over time, post-transplant coverage was extended to 3 years and eventually in December of 2000, the Beneficiary Improvements and Protection Act (BIPA 2000) provided an opportunity for extended post-transplant coverage for Medicare beneficiaries whose eligibility was based on age or non-ESRD disability. Lack of supplementary coverage for the expensive anti-rejection drugs that are used for post-transplant care is higher among minorities, which partially explains why African Americans and other minorities historically have had lower rates of transplantation than non-Hispanic whites. A difference-in- difference model will be developed based upon recent USRDS standard analysis files (SAF) to compare two sets of Medicare eligible: the first, Seniors (Age >= 65) and/or non-ESRD disabled, who are affected by the changes in the Medicare Law, and the second, Non-seniors (Age < 65) who only have ESRD, and are unaffected by the changes in the Medicare Law. Since BIPA 2000 was intended to reduce the patient's financial burden associated with post-transplant immunosuppressant drugs, passage of this law should disproportionately (positively) impact the rates of placement on the wait list for renal transplant and actual renal transplantation for the financially disadvantaged population, many of whom are minorities. This research will inform future health policy makers regarding the Congress' ability to improve the public health of our nation's growing ESRD population and reduce racial and ethnic health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research proposed in this application will explore the response to the passage of the Beneficiary Improvements and Protection Act (BIPA 2000) on the overall rate of renal transplantation, and the rate of placement on the renal transplantation waitlist. BIPA 2000 provided an opportunity for extended Medicare coverage for post-transplantation immunosuppressant drugs; if patients with ESRD responded to this, then passage of BIPA 2000 should positively affect the rates of transplantation for all patients with ESRD but particularly those sub-populations who are financially disadvantaged. Since, unfortunately, minorities are disproportionately among this financially disadvantaged group, we propose to test whether this policy change positively affects minorities and contributes towards the reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in the transplantation rates.          ",Response to Medicare Reimbursement Policy Change by Minority and All ESRD Patient,7496311,R21AG033791,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Physical Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Caring ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Other Minority ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Placement ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' beneficiary ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Insurance ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' disability ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' wasting ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Staging ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Belief ', ' experience ', ' Budgets ', ' Amendment ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' graft failure ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2008,227206,0.10394886594725955
"Role of reactive intermediates in lupus nephritis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is complicated by lupus nephritis (LN) in approximately 50 percent of cases. Among African-Americans with LN, standard therapy prevents renal failure in only 50 percent of patients over five years, compared to 85 percent among Caucasians. Adjunctive therapies that are targeted towards mediators of this aggressive LN phenotype are needed to resolve this disparity. LN is characterized by autoantibody production, glomerular immune complex deposition, and, in the case of proliferative disease, complement activation and subsequent innate immune response. An essential arm of the innate immune response is the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (ROI and RNI or RONI). We have described increased production of RNI in human SLE, most noticeably among African-Americans and those with proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). These observations were made using a marker of RNI production that is influenced by diet, making it a potentially less useful clinical biomarker of disease. Pharmacologic inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) prevents murine LN without affecting autoantibody production or complement activation, suggesting that the effect of NOS on glomerular inflammation is distal to complement activation. However ablation of the inducible NOS gene in a murine lupus model does not prevent renal disease, suggesting that iNOS is not the only enzyme affected by NOS inhibitors that is required for disease. The identity and tissue expression of other RONI-producing enzymes and the mechanisms through which their activity leads to increased glomerular inflammation have not been well characterized. Our overarching hypothesis is that reactive intermediate production is pathogenic in the progression of lupus nephritis. To address the above noted gaps in knowledge, reactive intermediates responsible for pathology must be identified, the location and identity of enzymes producing pathogenic RONI must be determined, and methods for targeting pathogenic RONI must be tested. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the association between a novel set of biomarkers of reactive intermediate production and disease type and response to therapy in human lupus nephritis, 2) Determine the effect of targeted genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of reactive intermediate production on LN in MRL/lpr mice, and 3) Determine the effect of RONI production on MRL/lpr innate immune response and spleen T cell activation. The ultimate goal of the application is to define RONI useful as disease biomarkers and targets for therapy. The specific aims will further characterize both enzyme and RI targets for such an approach.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a serious autoimmune disease that occurs in up to 1/200 young black women.

"Genomic and Cellular Markers and Chronic Renal Allograft Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic renal allograft survival is poorer in African Americans than Caucasians which may be due to medication non-adherence, racial differences in immunosuppressive pharmacokinetics, genomic factors, increased immunoreactivity, and racial variation in immunodynamic responses. This proposal describes a pilot study that is based on our preliminary findings that indicate race and gender impact on the interpatient variability in drug transport (gene and protein) and immunodynamic responses with immunosuppressive drug exposure within a dosing interval after renal transplantation. The hypothesis of this application is that individual renal allograft recipients receiving chronic, dose-adjusted immunosuppressives exhibit a time-dependent drug transporter dynamics and immunologic responses over a dosing interval that are influenced by race and gender. The specific aims are to: 1) Examine race and gender influence on time-dependent extracellular/intracellular immunodynamic responses and their relationship to extracellular/intracellular immunosuppressive concentrations; 2) Investigate interpatient and intrapatient, time-dependent patterns of P- glycoprotein expression (gene and protein) and function in relation to race, gender and drug concentrations. These aims will extend our initial four-hour studies of time-dependent responses of MDR1 gene expression, intracellular cytokines (IL-2 and IL-4) and extracellular immunodynamic responses of CD4+ and CD8+ T regulatory cells, T Helper 1 and T Helper 2 lymphocytes to include an entire twelve-hour dosing interval in renal transplant recipients. This study will also investigate the relationship of the P-gp transport protein and immunodynamic responses to race, gender, age, drug exposure, renal function, time post-transplant, HLA compatibility and concurrent medications. The results of this study will provide preliminary data to create a bridge from the non-specific clinical monitoring methods that are currently used to create a novel approach that incorporates cellular and genomic biomarkers. This patient specific approach will allow clinicians to provide more individualized immunosuppressive therapy and enhance allograft survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The significance of this project is related to the growing need for strategies that will increase allograft survival and function following renal transplantation due to the rising incidence of end stage renal disease in the United States. A primary concern is the observed racial disparity with regard to suboptimal renal allograft outcomes in spite of improved drug therapy. The results of this study will lead to the development of new therapeutic guidelines as well as potential biomarkers that incorporate race and gender differences in response to immunosuppression and facilitate individualization of drug treatment and improved allograft survival and function.          ",Genomic and Cellular Markers and Chronic Renal Allograft

"Response to Medicare Reimbursement Policy Change by Minority and All ESRD Patient    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans and Hispanics are disproportionately impacted by end-stage renal disease (ESRD) based upon disease prevalence, access to transplantation among diagnosed ESRD patients, and health outcomes. The Social Security Amendments of 1972 entitled almost all patients with ESRD in the United States to Medicare-funded renal transplantation, but limited coverage of post-transplant care to 1 year. Over time, post-transplant coverage was extended to 3 years and eventually in December of 2000, the Beneficiary Improvements and Protection Act (BIPA 2000) provided an opportunity for extended post-transplant coverage for Medicare beneficiaries whose eligibility was based on age or non-ESRD disability. Lack of supplementary coverage for the expensive anti-rejection drugs that are used for post-transplant care is higher among minorities, which partially explains why African Americans and other minorities historically have had lower rates of transplantation than non-Hispanic whites. A difference-in- difference model will be developed based upon recent USRDS standard analysis files (SAF) to compare two sets of Medicare eligible: the first, Seniors (Age >= 65) and/or non-ESRD disabled, who are affected by the changes in the Medicare Law, and the second, Non-seniors (Age < 65) who only have ESRD, and are unaffected by the changes in the Medicare Law. Since BIPA 2000 was intended to reduce the patient's financial burden associated with post-transplant immunosuppressant drugs, passage of this law should disproportionately (positively) impact the rates of placement on the wait list for renal transplant and actual renal transplantation for the financially disadvantaged population, many of whom are minorities. This research will inform future health policy makers regarding the Congress' ability to improve the public health of our nation's growing ESRD population and reduce racial and ethnic health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The research proposed in this application will explore the response to the passage of the Beneficiary Improvements and Protection Act (BIPA 2000) on the overall rate of renal transplantation, and the rate of placement on the renal transplantation waitlist. BIPA 2000 provided an opportunity for extended Medicare coverage for post-transplantation immunosuppressant drugs; if patients with ESRD responded to this, then passage of BIPA 2000 should positively affect the rates of transplantation for all patients with ESRD but particularly those sub-populations who are financially disadvantaged. Since, unfortunately, minorities are disproportionately among this financially disadvantaged group, we propose to test whether this policy change positively affects minorities and contributes towards the reduction in racial and ethnic disparities in the transplantation rates.          ",Response to Medicare Reimbursement Policy Change by Minority and All ESRD Patient,7682146,R21AG033791,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Provider ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Caring ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' beneficiary ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Immunosuppressive Agents ', ' immunosuppressive ', ' Immunosuppressants ', ' Insurance ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' disability ', ' Laws ', ' Learning ', ' wasting ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Policies ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Organ Transplantation ', ' organ xenograft ', ' organ graft ', ' organ allograft ', ' Transplantation Surgery ', ' Organ Transplants, Including Bone Marrow for DCT ', ' Organ Transplants ', ' Grafting Procedure ', ' Clinical, Transplantation, Organ ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Public Policy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Social Security ', ' Social Insurance ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Insurance Status ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transplantation ', ' transplant ', ' United States ', ' Waiting Lists ', ' Belief ', ' experience ', ' Budgets ', ' Amendment ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' graft failure ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,R21,2009,98228,0.10394886594725955
"A Targeted Approach to Increasing American Indian Tissue and Organ Donation Renal transplantation is associated with a better quality of life, lower costs, and longer life expectancy than long-term dialysis. Yet, despite the generally higher prevalence end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among minority populations in the U.S.,racial/ethnic disparities in access to care, appropriateness of recipients, and rates of kidney donation and transplantation have all been reported. More specifically, the prevalence of treated ESRD among American Indians (Als) is 3.5 times greater than that of Whites and results, overwhelming, from an excess of diabetes. Using incidence rates with Whites as the reference, the rate ratio of ESRD attributable to diabetes in Als is over 5.0.Additionally, the mean age of onset of ESRD among Als is 6 years younger than among their White counterparts. These statistics speak to an epidemic of ESRD among Als in the next decades. In this project, we will mount a multi-pronged program on ESRD and organ donation at 7 Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains. These states are primarily rural, contain medically underserved areas, and have large populations of Als. Because students are among those most likely to donate organs, TCUs offer the possibly of reaching a young, educated, and disease-free population of Als - features which make them desirable to approach about donation. To understand our target population's knowledge and attitudes regarding donation, we will conduct focus groups, then develop culturally appropriate educational materials (brochures, posters) to distribute at TCUs and surrounding communities. We will also create an on-line course on chronic diseases and ESRD, underscoring the need for kidney donation. Our specific aims are to 1) examine knowledge and attitudes regarding kidney donation and transplantation among Als at 7 large TCUs in Washington, Montana, and North Dakota; 2) collaborate with students and faculty to develop culturally tailored educational and media materials to heighten awareness of the need for donation and benefits of transplantation among TCU students and surrounding tribal communities; and 3) increase number of Als who consent to donate organs as documented by signed donor cards. Given the striking rates of diabetes and poverty among Als and rural location of most reservations, and the dearth of Al donors, we need understand views on organ donation. More importantly, we need to use this information to increase actual donation rates in this neglected minority.

"A National Consortium to Explore the Genotypic Basis for ESRD in Lupus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End stage renal disease (ESRD), one of the most serious and costly complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurs in a sub-set of patients with SLE-related renal involvement. Factors predisposing to ESRD presumably include both genetics and environmental factors, and there is unequivocal evidence that ESRD disproportionately affects lupus persons of African American descent. Data in SLE-related ESRD suggest that at least two genetic factors, -- certain allelic variants of the genes FCGR3A and MYH9, -- contribute to ESRD risk. However, two genes alone do not define the scope of genetic risk for ESRD. Therefore, building on our precedent data for genetic contributions, it is timely to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the genetic risk factors for ESRD in European American (EA) and African Americans (AA) with lupus nephritis (LN/ESRD). Until now, two major barriers have precluded such a study. Technical limitations in genotyping platform and coverage have been overcome with the Illumina Human Omni- 1 Quad BeadChip. To surmount the second barrier of limited study populations, we have assembled an unprecedented team of rheumatologists, nephrologists and statistical geneticists with IRB protocols active, the clinical studies infrastructure in place and the patient collections and clinical data more than 75% in hand. Thus (1) Our first aim is to characterize the genetic susceptibility factors associated with ESRD by performing a  GWAS with 800 EA LN/ESRD and 800 AA LN/ESRD compared to lupus subjects of each ethnicity but  without nephritis and normal control subjects.  (2) We propose that [gene x gene] and [gene x environment] interactions are biologically important and may be more easily detectable using the machine learning and more modern likelihood-based approaches. Therefore, our second aim is to apply novel approaches to gene discovery and biological pathway characterization including Bayesian networks, alternative decision trees, HyperLasso, and penalized logistic regression.  (3) Finally, our third aim is to build an essential resource, consistent with NIH specimen and data sharing guidelines and supported by the institution. This resource will enable follow-up studies in fine-mapping, deep-sequencing, SNP identification, pathway analysis and methods development. Our consortium leverages current resources and investments by NIAMS, NIDDK, NIEHS, NCRR, CDCP and private foundations to create a unique opportunity to address a major health care challenge. We have a substantial head start, drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, and are poised to identify genetic risk factors, leading to strategies for ESRD reduction, which would enable substantial cost savings and reduction in morbidity and mortality as it reduces ethnic disparities in health outcomes.           7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, this study is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a multidisciplinary team to leverage existing resources to address important questions about the underlying genetic influences on susceptibility to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in lupus. This understanding may lead to strategies for ESRD intervention, may reduce ethnic disparities in health outcome, and may enable substantial cost savings in the health care industry.

"Role of reactive intermediates in lupus nephritis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is complicated by lupus nephritis (LN) in approximately 50 percent of cases. Among African-Americans with LN, standard therapy prevents renal failure in only 50 percent of patients over five years, compared to 85 percent among Caucasians. Adjunctive therapies that are targeted towards mediators of this aggressive LN phenotype are needed to resolve this disparity. LN is characterized by autoantibody production, glomerular immune complex deposition, and, in the case of proliferative disease, complement activation and subsequent innate immune response. An essential arm of the innate immune response is the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (ROI and RNI or RONI). We have described increased production of RNI in human SLE, most noticeably among African-Americans and those with proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). These observations were made using a marker of RNI production that is influenced by diet, making it a potentially less useful clinical biomarker of disease. Pharmacologic inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) prevents murine LN without affecting autoantibody production or complement activation, suggesting that the effect of NOS on glomerular inflammation is distal to complement activation. However ablation of the inducible NOS gene in a murine lupus model does not prevent renal disease, suggesting that iNOS is not the only enzyme affected by NOS inhibitors that is required for disease. The identity and tissue expression of other RONI-producing enzymes and the mechanisms through which their activity leads to increased glomerular inflammation have not been well characterized. Our overarching hypothesis is that reactive intermediate production is pathogenic in the progression of lupus nephritis. To address the above noted gaps in knowledge, reactive intermediates responsible for pathology must be identified, the location and identity of enzymes producing pathogenic RONI must be determined, and methods for targeting pathogenic RONI must be tested. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the association between a novel set of biomarkers of reactive intermediate production and disease type and response to therapy in human lupus nephritis, 2) Determine the effect of targeted genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of reactive intermediate production on LN in MRL/lpr mice, and 3) Determine the effect of RONI production on MRL/lpr innate immune response and spleen T cell activation. The ultimate goal of the application is to define RONI useful as disease biomarkers and targets for therapy. The specific aims will further characterize both enzyme and RI targets for such an approach.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a serious autoimmune disease that occurs in up to 1/200 young black women. We have shown previously that reactive intermediates like nitric oxide are overproduced in lupus.

"Sociodemographic Disparities in Lupus Nephritis: Healthcare Access and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Access to quality healthcare is a challenge for minority and disadvantaged groups in the U.S. Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), a complex autoimmune disease, can cause nephritis and, in severe cases, end-stage renal disease. Lupus nephritis is a potentially preventable outcome that disproportionately afflicts vulnerable groups: women, racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, those lacking medical insurance and education, and children and the elderly. We have found that the incidence of lupus end- stage renal disease rose dramatically from 1995-2004 in the U.S., in particular among those 20-39 years old, women, and racial and ethnic minorities. More new cases now occur among Blacks than whites. The causes of these growing disparities are unknown. We hypothesize that multiple barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis exist for disadvantaged patients and are responsible for premature, excess, and avoidable morbidity and mortality. Our goals are to identify and prioritize potentially remediable barriers to healthcare access for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease, leading to both future research and policy interventions. Our uniquely qualified interdisciplinary research team will address nationwide socio-demographic variation in lupus nephritis healthcare and the potentially modifiable factors responsible for outcome disparities. We will constitute two nationwide cohorts: one with > 5000 patients with incident lupus nephritis from 2000-2004, and a second with >14,000 patients with incident lupus end-stage renal disease from 1995-2009 and investigate the factors that contribute to access to care and disparities. We have developed a conceptual model for understanding the determinants of health disparities in lupus nephritis and posit that potentially modifiable factors, such as subspecialist care, provider and medical center volume, medical insurance, and adherence to therapy, contribute to long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis, including the development of end-stage renal disease and death. Lupus patients from the affected communities will likely have great insight into our findings and should be involved in the development of strategies for overcoming observed barriers. We will perform focus groups of community lupus patients and investigate the barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease from patients' perspectives. The multidisciplinary research team will be composed of investigators with expertise in healthcare disparities research, biostatistics, pharmaco-epidemiology, administrative claims data, lupus epidemiology and quantitative research methodologies. The findings will be widely disseminated to the lupus community, physicians and healthcare workers. The results will provide guidance to clinicians and policy makers on strategies to reduce barriers and improve access to care and outcomes for all Americans with lupus nephritis.

"Disparities in Progression to Renal Replacement Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now recognized as a major public health problem. When the kidneys fail, death inevitably ensues without the aid of dialysis or kidney transplantation. It has long been recognized that African Americans are much more likely to experience end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In fact, African Americans are 4 times more likely to enter dialysis than whites. Hispanics are also at increased risk of ESRD, and are 1.7 times more likely to enter dialysis. Our previous research demonstrates that a driving force behind the increased rate of ESRD among African Americans is more rapid loss of kidney function in a larger proportion of the African American population. This application proposes a study to understand the reasons for this rapid disease progression among African Americans, and will expand our analysis to Hispanics. Our focus will be on risk factor control and clinical care provided for diabetes and hypertension, which together account for almost three-fourths of all ESRD in the U.S. To this end, we propose a retrospective cohort study of 2.7 million patients within a large managed care system. This cohort demonstrates the well-known disparity in ESRD rates despite equal access to health care benefits. Our unique study setting permits further control for differences in age, gender, and health insurance, and allows for extensive data capture using electronic health record systems, thereby allowing us to focus on disease burden, risk factor control, and the management of chronic disease according to established clinical practice guidelines. We will examine the time to ESRD and death from different starting points defined by kidney function, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We will also examine the rate of change in kidney function. Variables that represent the risk factors and clinical management associated with diabetes, hypertension, and advanced CKD will be tested for their ability to explain: (1) ESRD and death, (2), the rate of change in kidney function, and (3) the differences between African Americans, Hispanics, and other racial/ethnic groups in ESRD, death, and the rate of change in kidney function. The insights gained from this proposed study are critical to determine the next steps of research to understand the root causes of the racial/ethnic disparities in ESRD, and what can be done to address disparities with the context of existing medical care. This project has the potential to benefit African Americans, Hispanics, and all other persons at high risk of CKD. Moreover, the results of this study will provide a useful benchmark for comparisons of ESRD disparities among insured and uninsured populations in the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney disease is now recognized as a major public health problem in the U.S. This research will advance knowledge about how to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in end-stage renal disease (ESRD, which includes dialysis and transplantation), particularly among African Americans and Hispanics, who are at the highest risk of kidney failure.              Narrative Chronic kidney disease is now recognized as a major public health problem in the U.S. This research will advance knowledge about how to eliminate racial/ethnic disparities in end-stage renal disease (ESRD, which includes dialysis and transplantation), particularly among African Americans and Hispanics, who are at the highest risk of kidney failure.",Disparities in Progression to Renal Replacement Therapy,7652599,R01DK080097,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Medication Management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Health Care Delivery Study ', ' Clinical Management ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Monitor ', ' sex ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Incidence ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Morbidity -

"A genetic analysis of non-diabetic end stage renal disease in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans have a four-fold higher incidence rate of end stage renal disease (ESRD) relative to European Americans. This racial disparity is not fully accounted for by differences in socioeconomic status, access to medical care or control of hypertension. Additionally, familial aggregation studies indicate a strong genetic component to predisposition to ESRD. These observations suggest that an inherited susceptibility to ESRD is present. While diabetes associated ESRD is the leading individual cause of ESRD, it should be noted that more than half of all ESRD cases are not associated with diabetes. The goal of this proposal is to identify genes associated with non-diabetic ESRD in African Americans. A previous genome-wide scan of African Americans with non-diabetic ESRD showed evidence for linkage at three chromosomal regions, Ch13q13.1, Ch13q33.3, and Ch1q25.1. These regions will be investigated as part of the following Specific Aims. 1. Candidate genes in these regions will be selected based on known functional activity, subjected to high density SNP analysis, and tested for association with non-diabetic ESRD in a case-control design. 2. A dense SNP map of the most promising region, Ch13q33.3, will be completed to refine linkage peaks and prioritize regions into haplotype blocks for positional cloning of candidate genes. 3. Positional candidate genes in the haplotype blocks defined by Specific Aim 2 will be identified and tested for association with ESRD using high density SNP analysis. Associated regions will be sequenced to determine the specific genetic polymorphism contributing to ESRD susceptibility. The completion of these Specific Aims will result in the identification of one or more genes that are associated with susceptibility to non-diabetic ESRD in African Americans. The Medicare costs associated with ESRD are substantial and the personal cost to patients and their families is immeasurable. Despite the increased risk of non-diabetic ESRD among African Americans, limited research has been carried out targeted at understanding genetic susceptibility to non-diabetic ESRD. This research proposal is aimed at specifically identifying genes that are associated with susceptibility to non-diabetic ESRD. The results of this study will enable early identification of at-risk patients and contribute to our understanding of the pathophysiology of ESRD.           ",A genetic analysis of non-diabetic end stage renal disease in African Americans,7670472,F32DK080617,"['Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Caring ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Collection ', ' Genome Scan ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism Map ', ' SNP Map ', ' Family ', ' DNA Sequence ', ' positional cloning ', ' reverse genetics ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Methods ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Patients ', ' genetic pedigree ', ' pedigree structure ', ' Pedigree ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' American ', ' member ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Early identification ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Chromosomes ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' case control ', ' Genomics ', ' Accounting ', ' genome wide association study ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Susceptibility Gene ', ' predisposing gene ', ' Predisposition gene ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' hypertension control ', ' ']",NIDDK,WAKE FOREST UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F32,2009,28952,0.1175619677773685
"Inflammation and Sub-Clinical Renal Damage in Cocaine-Dependent African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to examine the effects of cocaine dependency on renal physiology in African Americans (AAs). Cocaine-dependent AAs are at risk for sub-clinical renal damage resulting from cocaine use, yet little data exists to guide clinicians in making substance-abuse and medical treatment decisions. Cocaine has been shown to effect renal function, but the extent of these effects and the mechanisms responsible are not clear. Vascular endothelial changes from increases in inflammatory components interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) may contribute to renal damage. Links between cocaine use and increased levels of IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP have been reported, but more research is needed, especially in the AA subpopulation. The short-term objective of this case-control pilot study is to determine if cocaine-dependent AAs exhibit signs of sub-clinical renal disease resulting from vascular endothelial damage associated with high levels of IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP. The specific aims are to: 1) determine the presence of sub-clinical renal damage (by microalbuminuria levels) in cocaine-dependent AAs, and 2) examine relationships between microalbuminuria levels and serum levels of inflammatory components IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP in cocaine-dependent AAs. Power is sufficient to test the hypotheses that 1) microalbuminuria levels in cocaine-dependent AAs will be greater than microalbuminuria levels in an age/sex-matched control group of AAs who do not use cocaine; and 2) microalbuminuria levels in cocaine-dependent AAs will correlate with serum levels of IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP. Cocaine-dependent AAs who are at least 18 years old (n =51) will be recruited from substance abuse treatment centers and the community using respondent-driven sampling. AAs who are not cocaine-dependent (controls; n = 51) will be recruited from the Department of Psychiatry outpatient clinics and the community. Cocaine-dependency will be defined using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) Axis I Disorders (SCID), and by self-report of cocaine use for at least 4 days out of the last 30 days. Participants will be excluded for blood transfusion within last 2 weeks, hypertension (BP > 140/90 mm/Hg), infection (CRP >10mg/L), uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c >15%), steroid, NSAID, or salicylate use > 1 month, pre-existing renal disease, HIV, cancer, autoimmune conditions, and pregnancy. Primary outcome variables are microalbuminuria levels and serum levels of IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP. Secondary variables for covariate analysis include addiction severity, demographic, income, and education variables, and physical and mental health functioning. This research is congruent with the mission of National Institute of Drug Abuse to improve substance-abuse treatment and health disparities in medically underserved populations. The knowledge gained could be used to make treatment decisions for cocaine dependency, and to design community-level clinical trials to reduce cocaine- related morbidity and mortality through early diagnosis and treatment o renal consequences of dependency. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cocaine-dependent AAs are at risk for sub-clinical renal damage possibly due to inflammatory causes. This is important when considered in the context of medically underserved populations, in whom cocaine-related risk for renal failure could go unrecognized and untreated. The knowledge gained from this research could be used to make treatment decisions for cocaine dependency, and to design community-level clinical trials to reduce cocaine-related morbidity and mortality in African Americans through early diagnosis and treatment of renal consequences of dependency.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Cocaine-dependent AAs are at risk for sub-clinical renal damage possibly due to inflammatory causes.

"Sociodemographic Disparities in Lupus Nephritis: Healthcare Access and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Access to quality healthcare is a challenge for minority and disadvantaged groups in the U.S. Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), a complex autoimmune disease, can cause nephritis and, in severe cases, end-stage renal disease. Lupus nephritis is a potentially preventable outcome that disproportionately afflicts vulnerable groups: women, racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, those lacking medical insurance and education, and children and the elderly. We have found that the incidence of lupus end- stage renal disease rose dramatically from 1995-2004 in the U.S., in particular among those 20-39 years old, women, and racial and ethnic minorities. More new cases now occur among Blacks than whites. The causes of these growing disparities are unknown. We hypothesize that multiple barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis exist for disadvantaged patients and are responsible for premature, excess, and avoidable morbidity and mortality. Our goals are to identify and prioritize potentially remediable barriers to healthcare access for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease, leading to both future research and policy interventions. Our uniquely qualified interdisciplinary research team will address nationwide socio-demographic variation in lupus nephritis healthcare and the potentially modifiable factors responsible for outcome disparities. We will constitute two nationwide cohorts: one with > 5000 patients with incident lupus nephritis from 2000-2004, and a second with >14,000 patients with incident lupus end-stage renal disease from 1995-2009 and investigate the factors that contribute to access to care and disparities. We have developed a conceptual model for understanding the determinants of health disparities in lupus nephritis and posit that potentially modifiable factors, such as subspecialist care, provider and medical center volume, medical insurance, and adherence to therapy, contribute to long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis, including the development of end-stage renal disease and death. Lupus patients from the affected communities will likely have great insight into our findings and should be involved in the development of strategies for overcoming observed barriers. We will perform focus groups of community lupus patients and investigate the barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease from patients' perspectives. The multidisciplinary research team will be composed of investigators with expertise in healthcare disparities research, biostatistics, pharmaco-epidemiology, administrative claims data, lupus epidemiology and quantitative research methodologies. The findings will be widely disseminated to the lupus community, physicians and healthcare workers. The results will provide guidance to clinicians and policy makers on strategies to reduce barriers and improve access to care and outcomes for all Americans with lupus nephritis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lupus is an autoimmune disease that mainly afflicts disadvantaged groups in the U.S., often causing kidney failure. The reasons why some groups suffer worse outcomes are not known.

"Genomic and Cellular Markers and Chronic Renal Allograft Function    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic renal allograft survival is poorer in African Americans than Caucasians which may be due to medication non-adherence, racial differences in immunosuppressive pharmacokinetics, genomic factors, increased immunoreactivity, and racial variation in immunodynamic responses. This proposal describes a pilot study that is based on our preliminary findings that indicate race and gender impact on the interpatient variability in drug transport (gene and protein) and immunodynamic responses with immunosuppressive drug exposure within a dosing interval after renal transplantation. The hypothesis of this application is that individual renal allograft recipients receiving chronic, dose-adjusted immunosuppressives exhibit a time-dependent drug transporter dynamics and immunologic responses over a dosing interval that are influenced by race and gender. The specific aims are to: 1) Examine race and gender influence on time-dependent extracellular/intracellular immunodynamic responses and their relationship to extracellular/intracellular immunosuppressive concentrations; 2) Investigate interpatient and intrapatient, time-dependent patterns of P- glycoprotein expression (gene and protein) and function in relation to race, gender and drug concentrations. These aims will extend our initial four-hour studies of time-dependent responses of MDR1 gene expression, intracellular cytokines (IL-2 and IL-4) and extracellular immunodynamic responses of CD4+ and CD8+ T regulatory cells, T Helper 1 and T Helper 2 lymphocytes to include an entire twelve-hour dosing interval in renal transplant recipients. This study will also investigate the relationship of the P-gp transport protein and immunodynamic responses to race, gender, age, drug exposure, renal function, time post-transplant, HLA compatibility and concurrent medications. The results of this study will provide preliminary data to create a bridge from the non-specific clinical monitoring methods that are currently used to create a novel approach that incorporates cellular and genomic biomarkers. This patient specific approach will allow clinicians to provide more individualized immunosuppressive therapy and enhance allograft survival. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The significance of this project is related to the growing need for strategies that will increase allograft survival and function following renal transplantation due to the rising incidence of end stage renal disease in the United States. A primary concern is the observed racial disparity with regard to suboptimal renal allograft outcomes in spite of improved drug therapy. The results of this study will lead to the development of new therapeutic guidelines as well as potential biomarkers that incorporate race and gender differences in response to immunosuppression and facilitate individualization of drug treatment and improved allograft survival and function.          ",Genomic and Cellular Markers and Chronic Renal Allograft Function,7878591,R21DK077325,"['Drug

"Racial Disparity in Quality of Clinical Care in End Stage Renal Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses Healthy People 2010's goal of eliminating racial disparities in healthcare. It also addresses the recent national emphasis on comparative effectiveness research to achieve the eventual goal of providing optimal care to all individuals. End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing health concern in the United States. Inequalities in multiple aspects of pre-ESRD and ESRD care among racial groups have been prominently highlighted in the last decade. Racial disparities can occur at multiple levels (individual patient, dialysis center and geographical region). A fundamental challenge in addressing racial disparities is to unravel the levels at which racial disparities occur and to identify the contributing factors at each of these levels, before corrective actions can be taken. The overall objective of this application is to dissect the causes of racial disparities in the processes of care and clinical outcomes in depth at the county and dialysis center levels for patients on chronic hemodialysis. This will be accomplished by applying advanced hierarchical (multilevel) statistical models to systematically examine the racial disparities in various performance measures across dialysis centers and across counties in the U.S. and uncover the sources of these variations while controlling for patient characteristics. We will examine a number of measures corresponding to important processes of care, including anemia management, care by specialists (nephrologists, dietitians) and vascular access preparation prior to ESRD therapy, as well as dialysis dose, anemia management, and preventative care at the ESRD stage. We will also examine the racial disparities in clinical outcomes (hospitalization and mortality) and relate these clinical outcomes to the disparities in care indicators. Aim 1 will assess the racial disparities in the processes of care both at pre-ESRD and ESRD stages, and clinical outcomes within and across U.S. counties, and examine to what extent the county-level variation in disparity can be attributed to county characteristics (e.g., minority composition, socioeconomic status). Aim 2 will assess the racial disparities within and across dialysis centers focusing on the ESRD care and clinical outcomes, and relate the dialysis center disparity level to center characteristics (e.g., ownership status, facility size, and clinical practice). The expansiveness of the United States Renal Data System augmented with the Area Resource File and the Census Zip Code Files provides invaluable data to accomplish these Aims. This study is designed to enhance our understanding of how the characteristics of geographical region and dialysis center contribute to the racial disparity in the care processes, and how the care processes, geographic region, and dialysis center interact in influencing clinical outcomes. The results of this research are critical for the development of more focused healthcare policy and interventions aiming at eliminating racial disparity in pre- ESRD and ESRD care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal will critically examine the variation in racial disparity in quality of medical care at the patient level, dialysis unit level and geographical regional level in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Understanding the sources of this disparity would help to minimize racial disparities and improve the care of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.              Project Narrative The proposal will critically examine the variation in racial disparity in quality of medical care at the patient level, dialysis unit level and geographical regional level in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

"Disparities in Progression to Renal Replacement Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now recognized as a major public health problem. When the kidneys fail, death inevitably ensues without the aid of dialysis or kidney transplantation. It has long been recognized that African Americans are much more likely to experience end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In fact, African Americans are 4 times more likely to enter dialysis than whites. Hispanics are also at increased risk of ESRD, and are 1.7 times more likely to enter dialysis. Our previous research demonstrates that a driving force behind the increased rate of ESRD among African Americans is more rapid loss of kidney function in a larger proportion of the African American population. This application proposes a study to understand the reasons for this rapid disease progression among African Americans, and will expand our analysis to Hispanics. Our focus will be on risk factor control and clinical care provided for diabetes and hypertension, which together account for almost three-fourths of all ESRD in the U.S. To this end, we propose a retrospective cohort study of 2.7 million patients within a large managed care system. This cohort demonstrates the well-known disparity in ESRD rates despite equal access to health care benefits. Our unique study setting permits further control for differences in age, gender, and health insurance, and allows for extensive data capture using electronic health record systems, thereby allowing us to focus on disease burden, risk factor control, and the management of chronic disease according to established clinical practice guidelines. We will examine the time to ESRD and death from different starting points defined by kidney function, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We will also examine the rate of change in kidney function. Variables that represent the risk factors and clinical management associated with diabetes, hypertension, and advanced CKD will be tested for their ability to explain: (1) ESRD and death, (2), the rate of change in kidney function, and (3) the differences between African Americans, Hispanics, and other racial/ethnic groups in ESRD, death, and the rate of change in kidney function. The insights gained from this proposed study are critical to determine the next steps of research to understand the root causes of the racial/ethnic disparities in ESRD, and what can be done to address disparities with the context of existing medical care. This project has the potential to benefit African Americans, Hispanics, and all other persons at high risk of CKD. Moreover, the results of this study will provide a useful benchmark for comparisons of ESRD disparities among insured and uninsured populations in the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic kidney

"A Targeted Approach to Increasing American Indian Tissue and Organ Donation Renal transplantation is associated with a better quality of life, lower costs, and longer life expectancy than long-term dialysis. Yet, despite the generally higher prevalence end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among minority populations in the U.S.,racial/ethnic disparities in access to care, appropriateness of recipients, and rates of kidney donation and transplantation have all been reported. More specifically, the prevalence of treated ESRD among American Indians (Als) is 3.5 times greater than that of Whites and results, overwhelming, from an excess of diabetes. Using incidence rates with Whites as the reference, the rate ratio of ESRD attributable to diabetes in Als is over 5.0.Additionally, the mean age of onset of ESRD among Als is 6 years younger than among their White counterparts. These statistics speak to an epidemic of ESRD among Als in the next decades. In this project, we will mount a multi-pronged program on ESRD and organ donation at 7 Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs) in the Pacific Northwest and Northern Plains. These states are primarily rural, contain medically underserved areas, and have large populations of Als. Because students are among those most likely to donate organs, TCUs offer the possibly of reaching a young, educated, and disease-free population of Als - features which make them desirable to approach about donation. To understand our target population's knowledge and attitudes regarding donation, we will conduct focus groups, then develop culturally appropriate educational materials (brochures, posters) to distribute at TCUs and surrounding communities. We will also create an on-line course on chronic diseases and ESRD, underscoring the need for kidney donation. Our specific aims are to 1) examine knowledge and attitudes regarding kidney donation and transplantation among Als at 7 large TCUs in Washington, Montana, and North Dakota; 2) collaborate with students and faculty to develop culturally tailored educational and media materials to heighten awareness of the need for donation and benefits of transplantation among TCU students and surrounding tribal communities; and 3) increase number of Als who consent to donate organs as documented by signed donor cards. Given the striking rates of diabetes and poverty among Als and rural location of most reservations, and the dearth of Al donors, we need understand views on organ donation. More importantly, we need to use this information to increase actual donation rates in this neglected minority.

"Inflammation and Sub-Clinical Renal Damage in Cocaine-Dependent African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this project is to examine the effects of cocaine dependency on renal physiology in African Americans (AAs). Cocaine-dependent AAs are at risk for sub-clinical renal damage resulting from cocaine use, yet little data exists to guide clinicians in making substance-abuse and medical treatment decisions. Cocaine has been shown to effect renal function, but the extent of these effects and the mechanisms responsible are not clear. Vascular endothelial changes from increases in inflammatory components interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-1), and C-reactive protein (CRP) may contribute to renal damage. Links between cocaine use and increased levels of IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP have been reported, but more research is needed, especially in the AA subpopulation. The short-term objective of this case-control pilot study is to determine if cocaine-dependent AAs exhibit signs of sub-clinical renal disease resulting from vascular endothelial damage associated with high levels of IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP. The specific aims are to: 1) determine the presence of sub-clinical renal damage (by microalbuminuria levels) in cocaine-dependent AAs, and 2) examine relationships between microalbuminuria levels and serum levels of inflammatory components IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP in cocaine-dependent AAs. Power is sufficient to test the hypotheses that 1) microalbuminuria levels in cocaine-dependent AAs will be greater than microalbuminuria levels in an age/sex-matched control group of AAs who do not use cocaine; and 2) microalbuminuria levels in cocaine-dependent AAs will correlate with serum levels of IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP. Cocaine-dependent AAs who are at least 18 years old (n =51) will be recruited from substance abuse treatment centers and the community using respondent-driven sampling. AAs who are not cocaine-dependent (controls; n = 51) will be recruited from the Department of Psychiatry outpatient clinics and the community. Cocaine-dependency will be defined using the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) Axis I Disorders (SCID), and by self-report of cocaine use for at least 4 days out of the last 30 days. Participants will be excluded for blood transfusion within last 2 weeks, hypertension (BP > 140/90 mm/Hg), infection (CRP >10mg/L), uncontrolled diabetes (HbA1c >15%), steroid, NSAID, or salicylate use > 1 month, pre-existing renal disease, HIV, cancer, autoimmune conditions, and pregnancy. Primary outcome variables are microalbuminuria levels and serum levels of IL-6, TNF-1, and CRP. Secondary variables for covariate analysis include addiction severity, demographic, income, and education variables, and physical and mental health functioning. This research is congruent with the mission of National Institute of Drug Abuse to improve substance-abuse treatment and health disparities in medically underserved populations. The knowledge gained could be used to make treatment decisions for cocaine dependency, and to design community-level clinical trials to reduce cocaine- related morbidity and mortality through early diagnosis and treatment o renal consequences of dependency. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cocaine-dependent AAs are at risk for sub-clinical renal damage possibly due to inflammatory causes. This is important when considered in the context of medically underserved populations, in whom cocaine-related risk for renal failure could go unrecognized and untreated. The knowledge gained from this research could be used to make treatment decisions for cocaine dependency, and to design community-level clinical trials to reduce cocaine-related morbidity and mortality in African Americans through early diagnosis and treatment of renal consequences of dependency.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Cocaine-dependent AAs are at risk for sub-clinical renal damage possibly due to inflammatory causes.

"A National Consortium to Explore the Genotypic Basis for ESRD in Lupus    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): End stage renal disease (ESRD), one of the most serious and costly complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), occurs in a sub-set of patients with SLE-related renal involvement. Factors predisposing to ESRD presumably include both genetics and environmental factors, and there is unequivocal evidence that ESRD disproportionately affects lupus persons of African American descent. Data in SLE-related ESRD suggest that at least two genetic factors, -- certain allelic variants of the genes FCGR3A and MYH9, -- contribute to ESRD risk. However, two genes alone do not define the scope of genetic risk for ESRD. Therefore, building on our precedent data for genetic contributions, it is timely to undertake a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify the genetic risk factors for ESRD in European American (EA) and African Americans (AA) with lupus nephritis (LN/ESRD). Until now, two major barriers have precluded such a study. Technical limitations in genotyping platform and coverage have been overcome with the Illumina Human Omni- 1 Quad BeadChip. To surmount the second barrier of limited study populations, we have assembled an unprecedented team of rheumatologists, nephrologists and statistical geneticists with IRB protocols active, the clinical studies infrastructure in place and the patient collections and clinical data more than 75% in hand. Thus (1) Our first aim is to characterize the genetic susceptibility factors associated with ESRD by performing a  GWAS with 800 EA LN/ESRD and 800 AA LN/ESRD compared to lupus subjects of each ethnicity but  without nephritis and normal control subjects.  (2) We propose that [gene x gene] and [gene x environment] interactions are biologically important and may be more easily detectable using the machine learning and more modern likelihood-based approaches. Therefore, our second aim is to apply novel approaches to gene discovery and biological pathway characterization including Bayesian networks, alternative decision trees, HyperLasso, and penalized logistic regression.  (3) Finally, our third aim is to build an essential resource, consistent with NIH specimen and data sharing guidelines and supported by the institution. This resource will enable follow-up studies in fine-mapping, deep-sequencing, SNP identification, pathway analysis and methods development. Our consortium leverages current resources and investments by NIAMS, NIDDK, NIEHS, NCRR, CDCP and private foundations to create a unique opportunity to address a major health care challenge. We have a substantial head start, drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, and are poised to identify genetic risk factors, leading to strategies for ESRD reduction, which would enable substantial cost savings and reduction in morbidity and mortality as it reduces ethnic disparities in health outcomes.           7. PROJECT NARRATIVE Drawing on established networks and clinical research infrastructure, this study is uniquely positioned to capitalize on a multidisciplinary team to leverage existing resources to address important questions about the underlying genetic influences on susceptibility to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in lupus. This understanding may lead to strategies for ESRD intervention, may reduce ethnic disparities in health outcome, and may enable substantial cost savings in the health care industry.

"Role of reactive intermediates in lupus nephritis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is complicated by lupus nephritis (LN) in approximately 50 percent of cases. Among African-Americans with LN, standard therapy prevents renal failure in only 50 percent of patients over five years, compared to 85 percent among Caucasians. Adjunctive therapies that are targeted towards mediators of this aggressive LN phenotype are needed to resolve this disparity. LN is characterized by autoantibody production, glomerular immune complex deposition, and, in the case of proliferative disease, complement activation and subsequent innate immune response. An essential arm of the innate immune response is the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (ROI and RNI or RONI). We have described increased production of RNI in human SLE, most noticeably among African-Americans and those with proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). These observations were made using a marker of RNI production that is influenced by diet, making it a potentially less useful clinical biomarker of disease. Pharmacologic inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) prevents murine LN without affecting autoantibody production or complement activation, suggesting that the effect of NOS on glomerular inflammation is distal to complement activation. However ablation of the inducible NOS gene in a murine lupus model does not prevent renal disease, suggesting that iNOS is not the only enzyme affected by NOS inhibitors that is required for disease. The identity and tissue expression of other RONI-producing enzymes and the mechanisms through which their activity leads to increased glomerular inflammation have not been well characterized. Our overarching hypothesis is that reactive intermediate production is pathogenic in the progression of lupus nephritis. To address the above noted gaps in knowledge, reactive intermediates responsible for pathology must be identified, the location and identity of enzymes producing pathogenic RONI must be determined, and methods for targeting pathogenic RONI must be tested. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the association between a novel set of biomarkers of reactive intermediate production and disease type and response to therapy in human lupus nephritis, 2) Determine the effect of targeted genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of reactive intermediate production on LN in MRL/lpr mice, and 3) Determine the effect of RONI production on MRL/lpr innate immune response and spleen T cell activation. The ultimate goal of the application is to define RONI useful as disease biomarkers and targets for therapy. The specific aims will further characterize both enzyme and RI targets for such an approach.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE.

"Role of reactive intermediates in lupus nephritis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is complicated by lupus nephritis (LN) in approximately 50 percent of cases. Among African-Americans with LN, standard therapy prevents renal failure in only 50 percent of patients over five years, compared to 85 percent among Caucasians. Adjunctive therapies that are targeted towards mediators of this aggressive LN phenotype are needed to resolve this disparity. LN is characterized by autoantibody production, glomerular immune complex deposition, and, in the case of proliferative disease, complement activation and subsequent innate immune response. An essential arm of the innate immune response is the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (ROI and RNI or RONI). We have described increased production of RNI in human SLE, most noticeably among African-Americans and those with proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). These observations were made using a marker of RNI production that is influenced by diet, making it a potentially less useful clinical biomarker of disease. Pharmacologic inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) prevents murine LN without affecting autoantibody production or complement activation, suggesting that the effect of NOS on glomerular inflammation is distal to complement activation. However ablation of the inducible NOS gene in a murine lupus model does not prevent renal disease, suggesting that iNOS is not the only enzyme affected by NOS inhibitors that is required for disease. The identity and tissue expression of other RONI-producing enzymes and the mechanisms through which their activity leads to increased glomerular inflammation have not been well characterized. Our overarching hypothesis is that reactive intermediate production is pathogenic in the progression of lupus nephritis. To address the above noted gaps in knowledge, reactive intermediates responsible for pathology must be identified, the location and identity of enzymes producing pathogenic RONI must be determined, and methods for targeting pathogenic RONI must be tested. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the association between a novel set of biomarkers of reactive intermediate production and disease type and response to therapy in human lupus nephritis, 2) Determine the effect of targeted genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of reactive intermediate production on LN in MRL/lpr mice, and 3) Determine the effect of RONI production on MRL/lpr innate immune response and spleen T cell activation. The ultimate goal of the application is to define RONI useful as disease biomarkers and targets for therapy. The specific aims will further characterize both enzyme and RI targets for such an approach.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE.

"Racial Disparity in Quality of Clinical Care in End Stage Renal Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses Healthy People 2010's goal of eliminating racial disparities in healthcare. It also addresses the recent national emphasis on comparative effectiveness research to achieve the eventual goal of providing optimal care to all individuals. End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing health concern in the United States. Inequalities in multiple aspects of pre-ESRD and ESRD care among racial groups have been prominently highlighted in the last decade. Racial disparities can occur at multiple levels (individual patient, dialysis center and geographical region). A fundamental challenge in addressing racial disparities is to unravel the levels at which racial disparities occur and to identify the contributing factors at each of these levels, before corrective actions can be taken. The overall objective of this application is to dissect the causes of racial disparities in the processes of care and clinical outcomes in depth at the county and dialysis center levels for patients on chronic hemodialysis. This will be accomplished by applying advanced hierarchical (multilevel) statistical models to systematically examine the racial disparities in various performance measures across dialysis centers and across counties in the U.S. and uncover the sources of these variations while controlling for patient characteristics. We will examine a number of measures corresponding to important processes of care, including anemia management, care by specialists (nephrologists, dietitians) and vascular access preparation prior to ESRD therapy, as well as dialysis dose, anemia management, and preventative care at the ESRD stage. We will also examine the racial disparities in clinical outcomes (hospitalization and mortality) and relate these clinical outcomes to the disparities in care indicators. Aim 1 will assess the racial disparities in the processes of care both at pre-ESRD and ESRD stages, and clinical outcomes within and across U.S. counties, and examine to what extent the county-level variation in disparity can be attributed to county characteristics (e.g., minority composition, socioeconomic status). Aim 2 will assess the racial disparities within and across dialysis centers focusing on the ESRD care and clinical outcomes, and relate the dialysis center disparity level to center characteristics (e.g., ownership status, facility size, and clinical practice). The expansiveness of the United States Renal Data System augmented with the Area Resource File and the Census Zip Code Files provides invaluable data to accomplish these Aims. This study is designed to enhance our understanding of how the characteristics of geographical region and dialysis center contribute to the racial disparity in the care processes, and how the care processes, geographic region, and dialysis center interact in influencing clinical outcomes. The results of this research are critical for the development of more focused healthcare policy and interventions aiming at eliminating racial disparity in pre- ESRD and ESRD care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal will critically examine the variation in racial disparity in quality of medical care at the patient level, dialysis unit level and geographical regional level in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Understanding the sources of this disparity would help to minimize racial disparities and improve the care of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.              Project Narrative The proposal will critically examine the variation in racial disparity in quality of medical care at the patient level, dialysis unit level and geographical regional level in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

"ESRD: Regional Variation in Medicare Spending & Racial Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are large variations in Medicare spending and utilization (healthcare intensity) across the United States. Such regional differences in intensity of care are not explained completely by patient case mix or patient preferences. Furthermore, outcomes, quality of care and patient satisfaction appear to be similar or worse in regions with the highest compared with lowest intensity of care. These findings have been interpreted to suggest that efforts to reduce spending in high intensity regions may be undertaken without compromising quality of care. However, high spending regions differ in other important respects from low spending regions. They are disproportionately urban, and include a disproportionately large percentage of minority groups. In considering the impact of policies to reduce spending and utilization in high intensity regions, it may be important to evaluate the extent to which there are currently racial- ethnic disparities in access to and quality of care in high and low intensity regions. This information may be important in shaping future interventions to address Medicare utilization and spending in these regions. To date, the relationship between regional differences in healthcare spending and health care disparities has not been studied in depth.  The applicant proposes to evaluate this relationship among patients with end- stage renal disease-a disease that disproportionately impacts minority groups and for which there are known racial-ethnic disparities in care. We will systematically evaluate racial ethnic disparities during several distinct phases of care including prior to initiation of ESRD, during treatment for ESRD and at the end of life prior to death.  We propose the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate the relationship between regional variation in healthcare intensity and racial disparities in access to preparatory measures for initiation of dialysis and preemptive transplantation 2) to evaluate the relationship between regional variation in healthcare intensity and racial disparities in quality of care measure for dialysis and transplantation 3) to evaluate the relationship between regional variation in healthcare intensity and racial disparities in end-of-life quality measures for terminally ill patients receiving dialysis. We anticipate that the proposed study will provide a comprehensive description of regional variation in healthcare intensity and disparities for minority populations with end-stage renal disease. Our findings may be helpful in raising awareness of the potential impact on racial-ethnic disparities in access to a quality of care of future health policy interventions to reduce spending in high intensity regions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Recent research into Medicare spending patterns has identified significant regional variation across the US in Medicare spending and utilization among otherwise similar patients. These spending patterns don't seem to correlate with better patient outcomes or provider satisfaction. Some have interpreted these findings to suggest the possibility that spending may be reduced in higher spending regions without compromising quality. However, the implications of targeting high spending regions in efforts to reduce costs and utilization have not been fully explored. In particular, these high spending regions tend to be disproportionately urban and home to a disproportionately large proportion of minority patients. Thus, it may be important to evaluate the extent to which access and quality of care in high spending regions is equitable for patients of different racial ethnic groups. If disparities in access to and quality of care among racial-ethnic groups are less favorable in high spending regions, it may be important to evaluate future policy changes in the context of such disparities. We propose to evaluate health disparities across regions with different patterns of Medicare spending for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) a disease that disproportionately impacts racial ethnic minority groups and for which there are known disparities in many aspects of care, including kidney transplant and nephrology referral.           Recent research into Medicare spending patterns has identified significant regional variation across the US in Medicare spending and utilization among otherwise similar patients.

"Genetic Epidemiology of Treatment Resistant Hypertension in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Phillips is an internist and Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA. The candidate's long-term goal is to develop an independent career with expertise in the application of genetic epidemiology, translational research methods and health services research to improve primary prevention, risk stratification and management of cardiovascular disease among racial and ethnic minorities. Dr. Phillips' is committed to developing a research career in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and health disparities. His previous research has been focused on improving quality of care and clinical outcomes with respect to heart failure disease management programs and health disparities. However, during the recent two years the applicant has expanded his research focus to more upstream targets for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease including hypertension which is a common, important modifiable risk factor and an antecedent to cardio-renal dysfunction, particularly in African Americans. Therefore, this career development and clinical research training program will enable the applicant to acquire additional training in genetic epidemiology and translational research including clinical applications of gene- expression, proteomics and biomarker profiling to improve risk stratification and predict disease progression and/or response to therapy. First, the proposed career development plan incorporates a multi-disciplinary training program designed to provide an intense, closely mentored, patient-oriented research experience. Second, the candidate will also enroll in a structured curriculum of didactic coursework in genetic epidemiology, advanced biostatics and longitudinal data management, translational research, clinical trial design and research ethics. Third, the training environment and mentoring team are well aligned to provide both the necessary resources and considerable expertise in genetic epidemiology and translational research, hypertension and vascular dysfunction. The primary mentor is Dr. Gary H. Gibbons who is Director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) at Morehouse School of Medicine and a Co-mentor Dr. Arlene B. Chapman, Director of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (ACTSI) who have established track records of success and experience with mentoring junior faculty and post-doctoral trainees towards independent research careers. Finally, the candidate will also design, implement and complete a clinical research project in order to develop pilot data which will be important for the success of future funding applications on the path to independence. The candidate is interested in the natural history of treatment resistant hypertension (defined as BP>140/90 mmHg despite >3 antihypertensive agents at optimum dose including a diuretic) in African Americans. Hypertension experts suggest prevalence estimates in the range of 8% to 30%. However, epidemiologic studies pertaining to this important public health problem are sparse in African Americans. During the award period, the candidate will design and implement a pilot study of African American subjects (N=247 cases versus N=247 controls with BP <140/90mmHg and <2 drugs) to test a series of interrelated hypotheses: i) African Americans with treatment resistant hypertension have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines), biomarkers of acute and chronic renal injury (microalbuminuria, proteinuria and kidney injury marker-1 [KIM-1]), and increased vascular stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV] and augmentation index [Aix]) compared with age/sex matched controls: ii) Allele frequencies for gain of function angiotensinogen (AGT) variants and AGT levels are significantly higher: iii) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, biomarker of renal injury, AGT variants modify systemic and intra-renal RAAS activation have additive effects on predicting renal dysfunction during follow-up.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a pilot study of African American subjects with

"Evaluating Payment Reform and Provider Practices to Improve Health Outcomes in Ch    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in the financing of health care may have direct implications for health disparities by having a differential impact on providers that serve minority and underserved communities. This may be especially true in a prospective payment system (PPS), involving a ""bundled"" payment to providers for a relatively broad set of services, that may not fully account for the costs of treating certain populations. In response to the change in financial incentives, providers may alter clinical practices in ways that could reduce or widen health disparities, leading to improved or worsened health outcomes. The proposed study uses the Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) payment reform as a ""natural experiment"" to study these issues. On 1/1/ 2011, the Medicare ESRD program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader PPS for many renal dialysis services. The study focuses on implications for Blacks, whose current Medicare ESRD costs for services being added to the PPS are approximately 21% higher compared to other race groups, and rural patients, whose dialysis facilities are likely to be smaller with higher fixed costs per treatment. Analyses will include Black and rural patients in low income areas, where facilities are likely to have a payer mix that includes more patients with Medicaid and fewer patients with private insurance, limiting opportunities to shift costs. The goal is to evaluate the ESRD payment reform and subsequent changes in facility practices as factors that may influence health disparities. This will be accomplished by examining the relative changes in outcomes and specific clinical processes of care for Black and rural dialysis patients, and relating processes of care to outcomes for these groups. Study aims are: 1) Examine the effects of ESRD payment reform on clinical outcomes for Black patients and patients in rural areas, compared to other patients; 2) Examine changes in access to care and specific clinical processes of care that may be incentivized by the ESRD payment reform, for Black patients and patients in rural areas, compared to other patients; and 3) Evaluate the relationship of changes in specific clinical processes of care that occur in response to the ESRD payment reform to changes in clinical outcomes for Black patients and patients in rural areas. As potential mediating factors, the study will assess the role of the facility's racial mix, facility/organization size and the facility's payer mix. Data for the over 330,000 Medicare dialysis patients and 5,000 dialysis facilities in the Medicare ESRD program will be supplemented by Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study data on approximately 4,500 hemodialysis patients in 140 facilities. Findings from this study will have broad public policy implications by providing insights into the effects of prospective payment on the care and outcomes of minority and underserved populations who are more costly to treat in ways not accounted for by the payment system. Lessons learned from provider practice responses to payment reform can be applied to the financing of care for other high-cost chronic conditions and will highlight opportunities to alter provider behavior as a way to reduce health disparities and improving outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader prospective payment system (PPS) for many renal dialysis services on January 1, 2011.

This study, which proposes a timely evaluation of ESRD payment reform and subsequent changes in dialysis facility practices as factors that may have direct effects on health disparities, will provide insights into the effects of prospective payment and provider practices on the care and outcomes of minority and underserved populations who are more costly to treat in ways not accounted for by the payment system.           Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader prospective payment system (PPS) for many renal dialysis services on January 1, 2011.

"Sociodemographic Disparities in Lupus Nephritis: Healthcare Access and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Access to quality healthcare is a challenge for minority and disadvantaged groups in the U.S. Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), a complex autoimmune disease, can cause nephritis and, in severe cases, end-stage renal disease. Lupus nephritis is a potentially preventable outcome that disproportionately afflicts vulnerable groups: women, racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, those lacking medical insurance and education, and children and the elderly. We have found that the incidence of lupus end- stage renal disease rose dramatically from 1995-2004 in the U.S., in particular among those 20-39 years old, women, and racial and ethnic minorities. More new cases now occur among Blacks than whites. The causes of these growing disparities are unknown. We hypothesize that multiple barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis exist for disadvantaged patients and are responsible for premature, excess, and avoidable morbidity and mortality. Our goals are to identify and prioritize potentially remediable barriers to healthcare access for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease, leading to both future research and policy interventions. Our uniquely qualified interdisciplinary research team will address nationwide socio-demographic variation in lupus nephritis healthcare and the potentially modifiable factors responsible for outcome disparities. We will constitute two nationwide cohorts: one with > 5000 patients with incident lupus nephritis from 2000-2004, and a second with >14,000 patients with incident lupus end-stage renal disease from 1995-2009 and investigate the factors that contribute to access to care and disparities. We have developed a conceptual model for understanding the determinants of health disparities in lupus nephritis and posit that potentially modifiable factors, such as subspecialist care, provider and medical center volume, medical insurance, and adherence to therapy, contribute to long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis, including the development of end-stage renal disease and death. Lupus patients from the affected communities will likely have great insight into our findings and should be involved in the development of strategies for overcoming observed barriers. We will perform focus groups of community lupus patients and investigate the barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease from patients' perspectives. The multidisciplinary research team will be composed of investigators with expertise in healthcare disparities research, biostatistics, pharmaco-epidemiology, administrative claims data, lupus epidemiology and quantitative research methodologies. The findings will be widely disseminated to the lupus community, physicians and healthcare workers. The results will provide guidance to clinicians and policy makers on strategies to reduce barriers and improve access to care and outcomes for all Americans with lupus nephritis.

"Disparities in Progression to Renal Replacement Therapy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now recognized as a major public health problem. When the kidneys fail, death inevitably ensues without the aid of dialysis or kidney transplantation. It has long been recognized that African Americans are much more likely to experience end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In fact, African Americans are 4 times more likely to enter dialysis than whites. Hispanics are also at increased risk of ESRD, and are 1.7 times more likely to enter dialysis. Our previous research demonstrates that a driving force behind the increased rate of ESRD among African Americans is more rapid loss of kidney function in a larger proportion of the African American population. This application proposes a study to understand the reasons for this rapid disease progression among African Americans, and will expand our analysis to Hispanics. Our focus will be on risk factor control and clinical care provided for diabetes and hypertension, which together account for almost three-fourths of all ESRD in the U.S. To this end, we propose a retrospective cohort study of 2.7 million patients within a large managed care system. This cohort demonstrates the well-known disparity in ESRD rates despite equal access to health care benefits. Our unique study setting permits further control for differences in age, gender, and health insurance, and allows for extensive data capture using electronic health record systems, thereby allowing us to focus on disease burden, risk factor control, and the management of chronic disease according to established clinical practice guidelines. We will examine the time to ESRD and death from different starting points defined by kidney function, as measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We will also examine the rate of change in kidney function. Variables that represent the risk factors and clinical management associated with diabetes, hypertension, and advanced CKD will be tested for their ability to explain: (1) ESRD and death, (2), the rate of change in kidney function, and (3) the differences between African Americans, Hispanics, and other racial/ethnic groups in ESRD, death, and the rate of change in kidney function.

"Racial Disparity in Quality of Clinical Care in End Stage Renal Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses Healthy People 2010's goal of eliminating racial disparities in healthcare. It also addresses the recent national emphasis on comparative effectiveness research to achieve the eventual goal of providing optimal care to all individuals. End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing health concern in the United States. Inequalities in multiple aspects of pre-ESRD and ESRD care among racial groups have been prominently highlighted in the last decade. Racial disparities can occur at multiple levels (individual patient, dialysis center and geographical region). A fundamental challenge in addressing racial disparities is to unravel the levels at which racial disparities occur and to identify the contributing factors at each of these levels, before corrective actions can be taken. The overall objective of this application is to dissect the causes of racial disparities in the processes of care and clinical outcomes in depth at the county and dialysis center levels for patients on chronic hemodialysis. This will be accomplished by applying advanced hierarchical (multilevel) statistical models to systematically examine the racial disparities in various performance measures across dialysis centers and across counties in the U.S. and uncover the sources of these variations while controlling for patient characteristics. We will examine a number of measures corresponding to important processes of care, including anemia management, care by specialists (nephrologists, dietitians) and vascular access preparation prior to ESRD therapy, as well as dialysis dose, anemia management, and preventative care at the ESRD stage. We will also examine the racial disparities in clinical outcomes (hospitalization and mortality) and relate these clinical outcomes to the disparities in care indicators. Aim 1 will assess the racial disparities in the processes of care both at pre-ESRD and ESRD stages, and clinical outcomes within and across U.S. counties, and examine to what extent the county-level variation in disparity can be attributed to county characteristics (e.g., minority composition, socioeconomic status). Aim 2 will assess the racial disparities within and across dialysis centers focusing on the ESRD care and clinical outcomes, and relate the dialysis center disparity level to center characteristics (e.g., ownership status, facility size, and clinical practice). The expansiveness of the United States Renal Data System augmented with the Area Resource File and the Census Zip Code Files provides invaluable data to accomplish these Aims. This study is designed to enhance our understanding of how the characteristics of geographical region and dialysis center contribute to the racial disparity in the care processes, and how the care processes, geographic region, and dialysis center interact in influencing clinical outcomes. The results of this research are critical for the development of more focused healthcare policy and interventions aiming at eliminating racial disparity in pre- ESRD and ESRD care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal will critically examine the variation in racial disparity in quality of medical care at the patient level, dialysis unit level and geographical regional level in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Understanding the sources of this disparity would help to minimize racial disparities and improve the care of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

"Genetic Epidemiology of Treatment Resistant Hypertension in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Phillips is an internist and Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA. The candidate's long-term goal is to develop an independent career with expertise in the application of genetic epidemiology, translational research methods and health services research to improve primary prevention, risk stratification and management of cardiovascular disease among racial and ethnic minorities. Dr. Phillips' is committed to developing a research career in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and health disparities. His previous research has been focused on improving quality of care and clinical outcomes with respect to heart failure disease management programs and health disparities. However, during the recent two years the applicant has expanded his research focus to more upstream targets for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease including hypertension which is a common, important modifiable risk factor and an antecedent to cardio-renal dysfunction, particularly in African Americans. Therefore, this career development and clinical research training program will enable the applicant to acquire additional training in genetic epidemiology and translational research including clinical applications of gene- expression, proteomics and biomarker profiling to improve risk stratification and predict disease progression and/or response to therapy. First, the proposed career development plan incorporates a multi-disciplinary training program designed to provide an intense, closely mentored, patient-oriented research experience. Second, the candidate will also enroll in a structured curriculum of didactic coursework in genetic epidemiology, advanced biostatics and longitudinal data management, translational research, clinical trial design and research ethics. Third, the training environment and mentoring team are well aligned to provide both the necessary resources and considerable expertise in genetic epidemiology and translational research, hypertension and vascular dysfunction. The primary mentor is Dr. Gary H. Gibbons who is Director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) at Morehouse School of Medicine and a Co-mentor Dr. Arlene B. Chapman, Director of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (ACTSI) who have established track records of success and experience with mentoring junior faculty and post-doctoral trainees towards independent research careers. Finally, the candidate will also design, implement and complete a clinical research project in order to develop pilot data which will be important for the success of future funding applications on the path to independence. The candidate is interested in the natural history of treatment resistant hypertension (defined as BP>140/90 mmHg despite >3 antihypertensive agents at optimum dose including a diuretic) in African Americans. Hypertension experts suggest prevalence estimates in the range of 8% to 30%. However, epidemiologic studies pertaining to this important public health problem are sparse in African Americans. During the award period, the candidate will design and implement a pilot study of African American subjects (N=247 cases versus N=247 controls with BP <140/90mmHg and <2 drugs) to test a series of interrelated hypotheses: i) African Americans with treatment resistant hypertension have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines), biomarkers of acute and chronic renal injury (microalbuminuria, proteinuria and kidney injury marker-1 [KIM-1]), and increased vascular stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV] and augmentation index [Aix]) compared with age/sex matched controls: ii) Allele frequencies for gain of function angiotensinogen (AGT) variants and AGT levels are significantly higher: iii) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, biomarker of renal injury, AGT variants modify systemic and intra-renal RAAS activation have additive effects on predicting renal dysfunction during follow-up.        This is a pilot study of African American subjects with treatment resistant hypertension (BP >140/90mmHg despite >3 antihypertensive agents at optimum dose including a diuretic versus controls with BP <140/90mmHg and <2 drugs including a diuretic) to test a series of interrelated hypotheses: i) African Americans with treatment resistant hypertension have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines), biomarkers of acute and chronic renal injury (microalbuminuria, proteinuria and kidney injury marker-1 [KIM-1]), and increased vascular stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV] and augmentation index [Aix]) compared with age/sex matched controls: ii) Allele frequencies for gain of function angiotensinogen (AGT) variants and AGT levels are significantly higher: iii) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, biomarker of renal injury, AGT variants modify systemic and intra-renal RAAS activation and have additive effects on predicting renal dysfunction (incident CKD diagnosis defined as GFR <60ml/min or doubling of serum creatinine) during follow-up.

"Role of reactive intermediates in lupus nephritis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a systemic autoimmune disease that is complicated by lupus nephritis (LN) in approximately 50 percent of cases. Among African-Americans with LN, standard therapy prevents renal failure in only 50 percent of patients over five years, compared to 85 percent among Caucasians. Adjunctive therapies that are targeted towards mediators of this aggressive LN phenotype are needed to resolve this disparity. LN is characterized by autoantibody production, glomerular immune complex deposition, and, in the case of proliferative disease, complement activation and subsequent innate immune response. An essential arm of the innate immune response is the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates (ROI and RNI or RONI). We have described increased production of RNI in human SLE, most noticeably among African-Americans and those with proliferative lupus nephritis (LN). These observations were made using a marker of RNI production that is influenced by diet, making it a potentially less useful clinical biomarker of disease. Pharmacologic inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS) prevents murine LN without affecting autoantibody production or complement activation, suggesting that the effect of NOS on glomerular inflammation is distal to complement activation. However ablation of the inducible NOS gene in a murine lupus model does not prevent renal disease, suggesting that iNOS is not the only enzyme affected by NOS inhibitors that is required for disease. The identity and tissue expression of other RONI-producing enzymes and the mechanisms through which their activity leads to increased glomerular inflammation have not been well characterized. Our overarching hypothesis is that reactive intermediate production is pathogenic in the progression of lupus nephritis. To address the above noted gaps in knowledge, reactive intermediates responsible for pathology must be identified, the location and identity of enzymes producing pathogenic RONI must be determined, and methods for targeting pathogenic RONI must be tested. We propose the following specific aims: 1) Determine the association between a novel set of biomarkers of reactive intermediate production and disease type and response to therapy in human lupus nephritis, 2) Determine the effect of targeted genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of reactive intermediate production on LN in MRL/lpr mice, and 3) Determine the effect of RONI production on MRL/lpr innate immune response and spleen T cell activation. The ultimate goal of the application is to define RONI useful as disease biomarkers and targets for therapy. The specific aims will further characterize both enzyme and RI targets for such an approach.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a serious autoimmune disease that occurs in up to 1/200 young black women. We have shown previously that reactive intermediates like nitric oxide are overproduced in lupus. The proposed research targeting these intermediates will potentially identify new biomarkers of disease and identify potential new targets for disease.

"Sociodemographic Disparities in Lupus Nephritis: Healthcare Access and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Access to quality healthcare is a challenge for minority and disadvantaged groups in the U.S. Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), a complex autoimmune disease, can cause nephritis and, in severe cases, end-stage renal disease. Lupus nephritis is a potentially preventable outcome that disproportionately afflicts vulnerable groups: women, racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, those lacking medical insurance and education, and children and the elderly. We have found that the incidence of lupus end- stage renal disease rose dramatically from 1995-2004 in the U.S., in particular among those 20-39 years old, women, and racial and ethnic minorities. More new cases now occur among Blacks than whites. The causes of these growing disparities are unknown. We hypothesize that multiple barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis exist for disadvantaged patients and are responsible for premature, excess, and avoidable morbidity and mortality. Our goals are to identify and prioritize potentially remediable barriers to healthcare access for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease, leading to both future research and policy interventions. Our uniquely qualified interdisciplinary research team will address nationwide socio-demographic variation in lupus nephritis healthcare and the potentially modifiable factors responsible for outcome disparities. We will constitute two nationwide cohorts: one with > 5000 patients with incident lupus nephritis from 2000-2004, and a second with >14,000 patients with incident lupus end-stage renal disease from 1995-2009 and investigate the factors that contribute to access to care and disparities. We have developed a conceptual model for understanding the determinants of health disparities in lupus nephritis and posit that potentially modifiable factors, such as subspecialist care, provider and medical center volume, medical insurance, and adherence to therapy, contribute to long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis, including the development of end-stage renal disease and death. Lupus patients from the affected communities will likely have great insight into our findings and should be involved in the development of strategies for overcoming observed barriers. We will perform focus groups of community lupus patients and investigate the barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease from patients' perspectives. The multidisciplinary research team will be composed of investigators with expertise in healthcare disparities research, biostatistics, pharmaco-epidemiology, administrative claims data, lupus epidemiology and quantitative research methodologies. The findings will be widely disseminated to the lupus community, physicians and healthcare workers. The results will provide guidance to clinicians and policy makers on strategies to reduce barriers and improve access to care and outcomes for all Americans with lupus nephritis. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lupus is an autoimmune disease that mainly afflicts disadvantaged groups in the U.S., often causing kidney failure.

"Understanding Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Survival on Dialysis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of more than half a million persons suffering from end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, nearly one-third are black, and the relative incidence of ESRD among blacks is 3.6-times higher than that among whites. In a study of 1.3 million incident ESRD patients, we recently showed that black patients under 50 die on dialysis at up to twice the rate of their white counterparts. We hypothesize that the increased dialysis mortality specific to younger black patients results from racial differences among several interacting components: the biology of renal failure, socioeconomic status (SES) and access to healthcare, and center and network-level factors. Characterizing the underlying mechanisms is critical to improve survival in this population. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms underlying increased mortality for young black patients on dialysis, we propose: 1. To identify subgroups of young ESRD patients in whom racial disparities in dialysis survival are attenuated or amplified, 2.

"Evaluating Payment Reform and Provider Practices to Improve Health Outcomes in Ch    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in the financing of health care may have direct implications for health disparities by having a differential impact on providers that serve minority and underserved communities. This may be especially true in a prospective payment system (PPS), involving a ""bundled"" payment to providers for a relatively broad set of services, that may not fully account for the costs of treating certain populations. In response to the change in financial incentives, providers may alter clinical practices in ways that could reduce or widen health disparities, leading to improved or worsened health outcomes. The proposed study uses the Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) payment reform as a ""natural experiment"" to study these issues. On 1/1/ 2011, the Medicare ESRD program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader PPS for many renal dialysis services. The study focuses on implications for Blacks, whose current Medicare ESRD costs for services being added to the PPS are approximately 21% higher compared to other race groups, and rural patients, whose dialysis facilities are likely to be smaller with higher fixed costs per treatment. Analyses will include Black and rural patients in low income areas, where facilities are likely to have a payer mix that includes more patients with Medicaid and fewer patients with private insurance, limiting opportunities to shift costs. The goal is to evaluate the ESRD payment reform and subsequent changes in facility practices as factors that may influence health disparities. This will be accomplished by examining the relative changes in outcomes and specific clinical processes of care for Black and rural dialysis patients, and relating processes of care to outcomes for these groups. Study aims are: 1) Examine the effects of ESRD payment reform on clinical outcomes for Black patients and patients in rural areas, compared to other patients; 2) Examine changes in access to care and specific clinical processes of care that may be incentivized by the ESRD payment reform, for Black patients and patients in rural areas, compared to other patients; and 3) Evaluate the relationship of changes in specific clinical processes of care that occur in response to the ESRD payment reform to changes in clinical outcomes for Black patients and patients in rural areas. As potential mediating factors, the study will assess the role of the facility's racial mix, facility/organization size and the facility's payer mix. Data for the over 330,000 Medicare dialysis patients and 5,000 dialysis facilities in the Medicare ESRD program will be supplemented by Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study data on approximately 4,500 hemodialysis patients in 140 facilities. Findings from this study will have broad public policy implications by providing insights into the effects of prospective payment on the care and outcomes of minority and underserved populations who are more costly to treat in ways not accounted for by the payment system. Lessons learned from provider practice responses to payment reform can be applied to the financing of care for other high-cost chronic conditions and will highlight opportunities to alter provider behavior as a way to reduce health disparities and improving outcomes.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader prospective payment system (PPS) for many renal dialysis services on January 1, 2011.

This study, which proposes a timely evaluation of ESRD payment reform and subsequent changes in dialysis facility practices as factors that may have direct effects on health disparities, will provide insights into the effects of prospective payment and provider practices on the care and outcomes of minority and underserved populations who are more costly to treat in ways not accounted for by the payment system.           h Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader prospective payment system (PPS) for many renal dialysis services on January 1, 2011.

"Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Robust systems to consent, screen, return results, and to evaluate processes and outcomes of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for common chronic diseases are missing and urgently needed. We propose that hypertension-associated CKD in African ancestry communities has emerged as a highly relevant and well-suited opportunity for a 'prototype' genomic medicine demonstration project that addresses common chronic illnesses managed in primary care settings. African ancestry populations with hypertension (HTN) have 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing CKD, and a 5-fold increased risk to progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared with whites. Recent discoveries demonstrate that testable alleles of the APOL1 locus on chromosome 22 have a major effect on and explain almost all of the excess risk for hypertension-associated CKD and its progression to ESRD in African ancestry populations. In this genomic medicine demonstration pilot project, we plan to implement a cluster randomized trial at primary care facilities of a network of community health centers in Harlem and the Bronx and at Mount Sinai Medical Center. The trial will test whether the desperately low probabilities of correct renal care i.e. appropriate ordering of tests to evaluate CKD and CKD progression, appropriate prescription of renoprotective renin angiotensin blockade, appropriate control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with albuminuria of African ancestry, will be improved significantly in those facilities that receive EMR-enabled renal care CDS incorporating APOL1 genomic risk information compared with those facilities that receive renal care CDS based on conventional risk information only.  The project will have three Specific Aims: 1) Understand knowledge, attitudes, beliefs about testing for APOL1, returning results, and engaging people of African ancestry and their clinicians into a process of testing, counseling and appropriate clinical care. 2) Develop systems and evidence-based advice messages to enable point of care Clinical Decision Support (CDS) for primary care providers advising renal care practice guidelines with our without genomic APOL1 risk information. 3) Conduct a cluster randomized trial assigning eight distinct primary care facilities to receive either renal care CDS with APOL1 genomic risk information (GENOMIC RENAL CARE FACILITY) or with conventional risk information (CONVENTIONAL RENAL CARE FACILITY) to guide primary care for non-diabetic African Americans with hypertension. In the long-term, the proposed genomic medicine demonstration pilot project is expected to generate essential new insights for sustainable adoption and large-scale dissemination of genomic medicine in diverse clinical settings providing care for common adult-onset diseases in general, and for underserved African Ancestry populations with large excess burden of non-diabetic kidney diseases specifically.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will conduct a randomized trial in a network of community health centers and primary care facilities to study the effects and challenges of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for patients of African ancestry with hypertension that are at risk for or have chronic kidney disease. The study will provide information whether patients at primary care facilities where genomic risk information for kidney disease is shared between providers and patients, and patients have different outcomes than patients in facilities where genomic risk information is not shared. This pilot project will create new insights on how genomic medicine approaches will be adopted and whether they can make a difference to improve primary care for hypertensive kidney disease in underserved minorities.                ",Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care,8514374,U01HG007278,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Angiotensins ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Chromosome 22 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22 ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Family ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Medicine ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Probability ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Renin ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' modifiable risk ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' end stage disease ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' randomized trial ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' ']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2013,739599,0.05762007202718525
"Racial Disparity in Quality of Clinical Care in End Stage Renal Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal addresses Healthy People 2010's goal of eliminating racial disparities in healthcare. It also addresses the recent national emphasis on comparative effectiveness research to achieve the eventual goal of providing optimal care to all individuals. End stage renal disease (ESRD) is a growing health concern in the United States. Inequalities in multiple aspects of pre-ESRD and ESRD care among racial groups have been prominently highlighted in the last decade. Racial disparities can occur at multiple levels (individual patient, dialysis center and geographical region). A fundamental challenge in addressing racial disparities is to unravel the levels at which racial disparities occur and to identify the contributing factors at each of these levels, before corrective actions can be taken. The overall objective of this application is to dissect the causes of racial disparities in the processes of care and clinical outcomes in depth at the county and dialysis center levels for patients on chronic hemodialysis. This will be accomplished by applying advanced hierarchical (multilevel) statistical models to systematically examine the racial disparities in various performance measures across dialysis centers and across counties in the U.S. and uncover the sources of these variations while controlling for patient characteristics. We will examine a number of measures corresponding to important processes of care, including anemia management, care by specialists (nephrologists, dietitians) and vascular access preparation prior to ESRD therapy, as well as dialysis dose, anemia management, and preventative care at the ESRD stage. We will also examine the racial disparities in clinical outcomes (hospitalization and mortality) and relate these clinical outcomes to the disparities in care indicators. Aim 1 will assess the racial disparities in the processes of care both at pre-ESRD and ESRD stages, and clinical outcomes within and across U.S. counties, and examine to what extent the county-level variation in disparity can be attributed to county characteristics (e.g., minority composition, socioeconomic status). Aim 2 will assess the racial disparities within and across dialysis centers focusing on the ESRD care and clinical outcomes, and relate the dialysis center disparity level to center characteristics (e.g., ownership status, facility size, and clinical practice). The expansiveness of the United States Renal Data System augmented with the Area Resource File and the Census Zip Code Files provides invaluable data to accomplish these Aims. This study is designed to enhance our understanding of how the characteristics of geographical region and dialysis center contribute to the racial disparity in the care processes, and how the care processes, geographic region, and dialysis center interact in influencing clinical outcomes. The results of this research are critical for the development of more focused healthcare policy and interventions aiming at eliminating racial disparity in pre- ESRD and ESRD care.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposal will critically examine the variation in racial disparity in quality of medical care at the patient level, dialysis unit level and geographical regional level in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. Understanding the sources of this disparity would help to minimize racial disparities and improve the care of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease.

"Evaluating Payment Reform and Provider Practices to Improve Health Outcomes in Ch    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in the financing of health care may have direct implications for health disparities by having a differential impact on providers that serve minority and underserved communities. This may be especially true in a prospective payment system (PPS), involving a ""bundled"" payment to providers for a relatively broad set of services, that may not fully account for the costs of treating certain populations. In response to the change in financial incentives, providers may alter clinical practices in ways that could reduce or widen health disparities, leading to improved or worsened health outcomes. The proposed study uses the Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) payment reform as a ""natural experiment"" to study these issues. On 1/1/ 2011, the Medicare ESRD program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader PPS for many renal dialysis services. The study focuses on implications for Blacks, whose current Medicare ESRD costs for services being added to the PPS are approximately 21% higher compared to other race groups, and rural patients, whose dialysis facilities are likely to be smaller with higher fixed costs per treatment. Analyses will include Black and rural patients in low income areas, where facilities are likely to have a payer mix that includes more patients with Medicaid and fewer patients with private insurance, limiting opportunities to shift costs. The goal is to evaluate the ESRD payment reform and subsequent changes in facility practices as factors that may influence health disparities. This will be accomplished by examining the relative changes in outcomes and specific clinical processes of care for Black and rural dialysis patients, and relating processes of care to outcomes for these groups. Study aims are: 1) Examine the effects of ESRD payment reform on clinical outcomes for Black patients and patients in rural areas, compared to other patients; 2) Examine changes in access to care and specific clinical processes of care that may be incentivized by the ESRD payment reform, for Black patients and patients in rural areas, compared to other patients; and 3) Evaluate the relationship of changes in specific clinical processes of care that occur in response to the ESRD payment reform to changes in clinical outcomes for Black patients and patients in rural areas. As potential mediating factors, the study will assess the role of the facility's racial mix, facility/organization size and the facility's payer mix. Data for the over 330,000 Medicare dialysis patients and 5,000 dialysis facilities in the Medicare ESRD program will be supplemented by Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study data on approximately 4,500 hemodialysis patients in 140 facilities. Findings from this study will have broad public policy implications by providing insights into the effects of prospective payment on the care and outcomes of minority and underserved populations who are more costly to treat in ways not accounted for by the payment system. Lessons learned from provider practice responses to payment reform can be applied to the financing of care for other high-cost chronic conditions and will highlight opportunities to alter provider behavior as a way to reduce health disparities and improving outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader prospective payment system (PPS) for many renal dialysis services on January 1, 2011. The current costs to Medicare for the services being added to the ESRD PPS, which totaled $3.1 billion in 2007, are approximately 21% higher for Blacks compared to other race groups, but much of these higher costs of ESRD care for Blacks are not fully accounted for in the new payment system. This study, which proposes a timely evaluation of ESRD payment reform and subsequent changes in dialysis facility practices as factors that may have direct effects on health disparities, will provide insights into the effects of prospective payment and provider practices on the care and outcomes of minority and underserved populations who are more costly to treat in ways not accounted for by the payment system.

"Genetic Epidemiology of Treatment Resistant Hypertension in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Phillips is an internist and Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA. The candidate's long-term goal is to develop an independent career with expertise in the application of genetic epidemiology, translational research methods and health services research to improve primary prevention, risk stratification and management of cardiovascular disease among racial and ethnic minorities. Dr. Phillips' is committed to developing a research career in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and health disparities. His previous research has been focused on improving quality of care and clinical outcomes with respect to heart failure disease management programs and health disparities. However, during the recent two years the applicant has expanded his research focus to more upstream targets for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease including hypertension which is a common, important modifiable risk factor and an antecedent to cardio-renal dysfunction, particularly in African Americans. Therefore, this career development and clinical research training program will enable the applicant to acquire additional training in genetic epidemiology and translational research including clinical applications of gene- expression, proteomics and biomarker profiling to improve risk stratification and predict disease progression and/or response to therapy. First, the proposed career development plan incorporates a multi-disciplinary training program designed to provide an intense, closely mentored, patient-oriented research experience. Second, the candidate will also enroll in a structured curriculum of didactic coursework in genetic epidemiology, advanced biostatics and longitudinal data management, translational research, clinical trial design and research ethics. Third, the training environment and mentoring team are well aligned to provide both the necessary resources and considerable expertise in genetic epidemiology and translational research, hypertension and vascular dysfunction. The primary mentor is Dr. Gary H. Gibbons who is Director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) at Morehouse School of Medicine and a Co-mentor Dr. Arlene B. Chapman, Director of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (ACTSI) who have established track records of success and experience with mentoring junior faculty and post-doctoral trainees towards independent research careers. Finally, the candidate will also design, implement and complete a clinical research project in order to develop pilot data which will be important for the success of future funding applications on the path to independence. The candidate is interested in the natural history of treatment resistant hypertension (defined as BP>140/90 mmHg despite >3 antihypertensive agents at optimum dose including a diuretic) in African Americans. Hypertension experts suggest prevalence estimates in the range of 8% to 30%. However, epidemiologic studies pertaining to this important public health problem are sparse in African Americans. During the award period, the candidate will design and implement a pilot study of African American subjects (N=247 cases versus N=247 controls with BP <140/90mmHg and <2 drugs) to test a series of interrelated hypotheses: i) African Americans with treatment resistant hypertension have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines), biomarkers of acute and chronic renal injury (microalbuminuria, proteinuria and kidney injury marker-1 [KIM-1]), and increased vascular stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV] and augmentation index [Aix]) compared with age/sex matched controls: ii) Allele frequencies for gain of function angiotensinogen (AGT) variants and AGT levels are significantly higher: iii) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, biomarker of renal injury, AGT variants modify systemic and intra-renal RAAS activation have additive effects on predicting renal dysfunction during follow-up.        This is a pilot study of African American subjects with treatment resistant hypertension (BP >140/90mmHg despite >3 antihypertensive agents at optimum dose including a diuretic versus controls with BP <140/90mmHg and <2 drugs including a diuretic) to test a series of interrelated hypotheses: i) African Americans with treatment resistant hypertension have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines), biomarkers of acute and chronic renal injury (microalbuminuria, proteinuria and kidney injury marker-1 [KIM-1]), and increased vascular stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV] and augmentation index [Aix]) compared with age/sex matched controls: ii) Allele frequencies for gain of function angiotensinogen (AGT) variants and AGT levels are significantly higher: iii) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, biomarker of renal injury, AGT variants modify systemic and intra-renal RAAS activation and have additive effects on predicting renal dysfunction (incident CKD diagnosis defined as GFR <60ml/min or doubling of serum creatinine) during follow-up.

"Sociodemographic Disparities in Lupus Nephritis: Healthcare Access and Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Access to quality healthcare is a challenge for minority and disadvantaged groups in the U.S. Systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), a complex autoimmune disease, can cause nephritis and, in severe cases, end-stage renal disease. Lupus nephritis is a potentially preventable outcome that disproportionately afflicts vulnerable groups: women, racial and ethnic minorities, the poor, those lacking medical insurance and education, and children and the elderly. We have found that the incidence of lupus end- stage renal disease rose dramatically from 1995-2004 in the U.S., in particular among those 20-39 years old, women, and racial and ethnic minorities. More new cases now occur among Blacks than whites. The causes of these growing disparities are unknown. We hypothesize that multiple barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis exist for disadvantaged patients and are responsible for premature, excess, and avoidable morbidity and mortality. Our goals are to identify and prioritize potentially remediable barriers to healthcare access for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease, leading to both future research and policy interventions. Our uniquely qualified interdisciplinary research team will address nationwide socio-demographic variation in lupus nephritis healthcare and the potentially modifiable factors responsible for outcome disparities. We will constitute two nationwide cohorts: one with > 5000 patients with incident lupus nephritis from 2000-2004, and a second with >14,000 patients with incident lupus end-stage renal disease from 1995-2009 and investigate the factors that contribute to access to care and disparities. We have developed a conceptual model for understanding the determinants of health disparities in lupus nephritis and posit that potentially modifiable factors, such as subspecialist care, provider and medical center volume, medical insurance, and adherence to therapy, contribute to long-term outcomes in lupus nephritis, including the development of end-stage renal disease and death. Lupus patients from the affected communities will likely have great insight into our findings and should be involved in the development of strategies for overcoming observed barriers. We will perform focus groups of community lupus patients and investigate the barriers to quality healthcare for lupus nephritis and end-stage renal disease from patients' perspectives. The multidisciplinary research team will be composed of investigators with expertise in healthcare disparities research, biostatistics, pharmaco-epidemiology, administrative claims data, lupus epidemiology and quantitative research methodologies. The findings will be widely disseminated to the lupus community, physicians and healthcare workers. The results will provide guidance to clinicians and policy makers on strategies to reduce barriers and improve access to care and outcomes for all Americans with lupus nephritis.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lupus is an autoimmune disease that mainly afflicts disadvantaged groups in the U.S., often causing kidney failure. The reasons why some groups suffer worse outcomes are not known. We will investigate how differences in healthcare access are related to ""gaps"" in outcomes for lupus kidney disease.

"ESRD: Regional Variation in Medicare Spending & Racial Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are large variations in Medicare spending and utilization (healthcare intensity) across the United States. Such regional differences in intensity of care are not explained completely by patient case mix or patient preferences. Furthermore, outcomes, quality of care and patient satisfaction appear to be similar or worse in regions with the highest compared with lowest intensity of care. These findings have been interpreted to suggest that efforts to reduce spending in high intensity regions may be undertaken without compromising quality of care. However, high spending regions differ in other important respects from low spending regions. They are disproportionately urban, and include a disproportionately large percentage of minority groups. In considering the impact of policies to reduce spending and utilization in high intensity regions, it may be important to evaluate the extent to which there are currently racial- ethnic disparities in access to and quality of care in high and low intensity regions. This information may be important in shaping future interventions to address Medicare utilization and spending in these regions. To date, the relationship between regional differences in healthcare spending and health care disparities has not been studied in depth.  The applicant proposes to evaluate this relationship among patients with end- stage renal disease-a disease that disproportionately impacts minority groups and for which there are known racial-ethnic disparities in care. We will systematically evaluate racial ethnic disparities during several distinct phases of care including prior to initiation of ESRD, during treatment for ESRD and at the end of life prior to death.  We propose the following specific aims: 1) to evaluate the relationship between regional variation in healthcare intensity and racial disparities in access to preparatory measures for initiation of dialysis and preemptive transplantation 2) to evaluate the relationship between regional variation in healthcare intensity and racial disparities in quality of care measure for dialysis and transplantation 3) to evaluate the relationship between regional variation in healthcare intensity and racial disparities in end-of-life quality measures for terminally ill patients receiving dialysis. We anticipate that the proposed study will provide a comprehensive description of regional variation in healthcare intensity and disparities for minority populations with end-stage renal disease. Our findings may be helpful in raising awareness of the potential impact on racial-ethnic disparities in access to a quality of care of future health policy interventions to reduce spending in high intensity regions.        Recent research into Medicare spending patterns has identified significant regional variation across the US in Medicare spending and utilization among otherwise similar patients. These spending patterns don't seem to correlate with better patient outcomes or provider satisfaction. Some have interpreted these findings to suggest the possibility that spending may be reduced in higher spending regions without compromising quality. However, the implications of targeting high spending regions in efforts to reduce costs and utilization have not been fully explored. In particular, these high spending regions tend to be disproportionately urban and home to a disproportionately large proportion of minority patients. Thus, it may be important to evaluate the extent to which access and quality of care in high spending regions is equitable for patients of different racial ethnic groups. If disparities in access to and quality of care among racial-ethnic groups are less favorable in high spending regions, it may be important to evaluate future policy changes in the context of such disparities. We propose to evaluate health disparities across regions with different patterns of Medicare spending for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) a disease that disproportionately impacts racial ethnic minority groups and for which there are known disparities in many aspects of care, including kidney transplant and nephrology referral.

"Understanding Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Survival on Dialysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of more than half a million persons suffering from end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, nearly one-third are black, and the relative incidence of ESRD among blacks is 3.6-times higher than that among whites. In a study of 1.3 million incident ESRD patients, we recently showed that black patients under 50 die on dialysis at up to twice the rate of their white counterparts. We hypothesize that the increased dialysis mortality specific to younger black patients results from racial differences among several  interacting components: the biology of renal failure, socioeconomic status (SES) and access to healthcare, and center and network-level factors. Characterizing the underlying mechanisms is critical to improve survival in this population. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms underlying increased mortality for young black patients on dialysis, we propose: 1. To identify subgroups of young ESRD patients in whom racial disparities in dialysis survival are attenuated or amplified, 2. To identify multilevel predictors of reduced survival for younger black patients, and 3.To identify additional factors not captured in the national registry that might explain racia disparities in dialysis survival. The fellowship applicant aspires to become an academic nephrologist, dividing her time between research and patient care. She aspires to use epidemiologic and statistical methods to better understand the mechanisms underlying disease processes and to quantify the effects of treatments, practices, and policies on patient health, with the hope of improving providers' and patients' ability to make informed, evidence-based decisions. Under this fellowship she hopes to complete a combined MD and PhD in epidemiology, which will allow her to build a strong methodological foundation and afford her protected time to produce an integrated body of work addressing a complex research question, facilitating her transition from guided researcher to independent investigator. Specific goals for this fellowship include: 1. Gain exposure to clinical nephrology, 2.Gain exposure to clinical transplant, 3. Achieve a strong foundation in clinical epidemiologic methods, 4. Attain proficiency in advanced statistical methods and further develop statistical programming skills, 5. Enhance skills in scientific discourse and master effective oral and written presentation of scientific findings, 6. Gain experience in the development, conduct, and maintenance of longitudinal cohort studies, 7. Learn to coordinate a multidisciplinary research team, and 8. Develop skills to become an independent investigator. At the start of the funding period, the applicant will be entering her second year of medical training at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She has already completed a masters' degree in epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, and has spent the past 4 years pursuing epidemiologic research full-time in the Johns Hopkins Department of Surgery, under the mentorship of Dr. Dorry Segev, the sponsor of this fellowship. The proposed research seeks to understand the mechanisms underlying disparities in dialysis survival for younger black patients with end-stage renal disease. Patient, center, and regional factors and potential interactions between them will be explored using a variety of epidemiologic approaches. The results will be critical for informing interventions to improve survival in this population.",Understanding Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Survival on Dialysis,8637072,F30DK095545,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Biology ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' hematopoietin ', ' erythrocyte colony stimulating factor ', ' Epoetin ', ' ECSF ', ' Erythropoietin ', ' Fellowship ', ' Fistula ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Writing ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Subgroup ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2014,47676,0.09222064715860152
"Evaluating Payment Reform and Provider Practices to Improve Health Outcomes in Ch    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Changes in the financing of health care may have direct implications for health disparities by having a differential impact on providers that serve minority and underserved communities. This may be especially true in a prospective payment system (PPS), involving a ""bundled"" payment to providers for a relatively broad set of services, that may not fully account for the costs of treating certain populations. In response to the change in financial incentives, providers may alter clinical practices in ways that could reduce or widen health disparities, leading to improved or worsened health outcomes. The proposed study uses the Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) payment reform as a ""natural experiment"" to study these issues. On 1/1/ 2011, the Medicare ESRD program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader PPS for many renal dialysis services. The study focuses on implications for Blacks, whose current Medicare ESRD costs for services being added to the PPS are approximately 21% higher compared to other race groups, and rural patients, whose dialysis facilities are likely to be smaller with higher fixed costs per treatment. Analyses will include Black and rural patients in low income areas, where facilities are likely to have a payer mix that includes more patients with Medicaid and fewer patients with private insurance, limiting opportunities to shift costs. The goal is to evaluate the ESRD payment reform and subsequent changes in facility practices as factors that may influence health disparities. This will be accomplished by examining the relative changes in outcomes and specific clinical processes of care for Black and rural dialysis patients, and relating processes of care to outcomes for these groups. Study aims are: 1) Examine the effects of ESRD payment reform on clinical outcomes for Black patients and patients in rural areas, compared to other patients; 2) Examine changes in access to care and specific clinical processes of care that may be incentivized by the ESRD payment reform, for Black patients and patients in rural areas, compared to other patients; and 3) Evaluate the relationship of changes in specific clinical processes of care that occur in response to the ESRD payment reform to changes in clinical outcomes for Black patients and patients in rural areas. As potential mediating factors, the study will assess the role of the facility's racial mix, facility/organization size and the facility's payer mix. Data for the over 330,000 Medicare dialysis patients and 5,000 dialysis facilities in the Medicare ESRD program will be supplemented by Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study data on approximately 4,500 hemodialysis patients in 140 facilities. Findings from this study will have broad public policy implications by providing insights into the effects of prospective payment on the care and outcomes of minority and underserved populations who are more costly to treat in ways not accounted for by the payment system. Lessons learned from provider practice responses to payment reform can be applied to the financing of care for other high-cost chronic conditions and will highlight opportunities to alter provider behavior as a way to reduce health disparities and improving outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Medicare end-stage renal disease (ESRD) program will transition from fee-for-service payment to a broader prospective payment system (PPS) for many renal dialysis services on January 1, 2011. The current costs to Medicare for the services being added to the ESRD PPS, which totaled $3.1 billion in 2007, are approximately 21% higher for Blacks compared to other race groups, but much of these higher costs of ESRD care for Blacks are not fully accounted for in the new payment system. This study, which proposes a timely evaluation of ESRD payment reform and subsequent changes in dialysis facility practices as factors that may have direct effects on health disparities, will provide insights into the effects of prospective payment and provider practices on the care and outcomes of minority and underserved populations who are more costly to treat in ways not accounted for by the payment system.

"Sodium-restricted diets and symptoms in end stage renal disease: An RCT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary sodium intake independently increases mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The benefits of sodium restriction in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are consistently demonstrated in scientific reports, though little is known about the appropriate prescription of dietary sodium intake. Specifically, there is a lack of evidence of either harm or benefit of universal practiced recommendations. The overall objective of the proposed NINR Career Development Award is to receive advanced research training in: (1) Renal physiology including fluid and electrolyte balance, the physiology and mechanics of HD therapy and body composition; and the role of nutrition in management of ESRD; (2) Symptom science in patients with ESRD, the scientific rationale for symptom management, and how symptoms are related to physiological and nutritional changes; (3) Methods and measurement strategies of renal-related physiological variables, biological markers, and patient symptoms; (4) Repeated measures, longitudinal data analysis of physiologic variables; (5) Bioethics of studying vulnerable populations with chronic illness and how that content relates to the responsible conduct of research (RCR), and data/safety monitoring and randomized controlled trials (RCT). As part of my career development, I will conduct an RCT to study the effects of three levels of sodium intake (ambient control group [CG], 1500 mg/d [1.5G], 2400 mg/d [2.4G]) on the HD symptom profile of ESRD patients. The proposed study will be the first of its kind to offer empiric support for or against the current dietary sodium intake recommendations. The study will provide the first step to gathering essential evidence needed to correctly identify the appropriate dietary sodium restriction prescription. The specific aims are to: 1) demonstrate that symptom profiles and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) vary among three sodium intake groups (CG, sodium intake of 1.5G, sodium intake of 2.4G), controlling for age, race, gender, and duration of disease; 2) demonstrate that the effect of HD-specific variables [ultrafiltration rate (liters/hour) and total luid removed (liters)] on the symptom profiles vary among the three sodium intake groups (CG, 1.5G, 2.4G), controlling for age, race, gender, and duration of disease; 3) determine whether total body water (TBW), extracellular fluid (ECF), and intracellular (ICF) measured with bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) varies across sodium intake groups (CG, 1.5G, 2.4G), controlling for age, race, gender, and duration of disease. Forty-two adult participants will be recruited from the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania Renal, Electrolyte, and Hypertension Division (Renal Group) and will be randomized to one three sodium-controlled diets during a 5- day stay in the Clinical and Translational Research Center. The primary study outcomes are IDWG and symptom burden as measured with the Palliative Care Outcome Scale-Renal. Secondary outcomes include TBW, ECF, ICF, and HD-specific variables. A series of multiple regression models will be used to test the study aims.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The candidate proposes research training to prepare her to study symptom management of end-stage renal disease. She plans to study the biological basis of end-stage renal disease and the role of sodium restricted diets in the management of symptoms. As part of her training, she will initiate a small trial to determine the effects of thre levels of sodium intake (ambient control group [CG], 1500 mg/d [1.5G], 2400 mg/d [2.4G]) on the symptoms that hemodialysis patients experience.            ",Sodium-restricted diets and symptoms in end stage renal disease: An RCT,8750606,K23NR015058,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Bioethics ', ' Body Composition ', ' Body Water ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Low-Sodium Diet ', ' Low-Salt Diet ', ' Sodium-Restricted Diet ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Electrolyte Balance ', ' Electrolytes ', ' Extracellular Fluid ', ' Fluid Balance ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' University Hospitals ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Hypotension ', ' Intracellular Fluid ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Muscular Cramp ', ' Cramp ', ' Muscle Cramp ', ' Persons ', ' Nausea and Vomiting ', ' Nurses ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Palliative Care ', ' Patients ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Safety ', ' Science ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Dietary Sodium ', ' Spectrum Analyses ', ' Spectroscopy ', ' Spectrum Analysis ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Ultrafiltration ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' programs ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Scientist ', ' Hour ', ' Outcome Study ', ' hypervolemia ', ' Fluid overload ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' resection ', ' Surgical Removal ', ' Removal ', ' Extirpation ', ' Abscission ', ' Excision ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' disease length ', ' disease duration ', ' illness length ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' nutritious ', ' Nutritional ', ' Monitor ', ' symptom management ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' translational sciences center ', ' translational research center ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' public health relevance ', ' secondary outcome ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K23,2014,133264,0.04692967003156306
"Mississippi Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Researchers Program  Mississippi is among the leaders in mortality due to heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and kidney disease. Mississippi also has the greatest health care disparities in the country along with limited extramural research support necessary to recruit and retain top biomedical researchers that can address these important issues. These widening health care disparities affect underrepresented minorities, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans, who are disproportionately affected by heart disease, stroke, diabetes, nephritis/nephrosis, hypertension and hypertension related renal diseases. Therefore, a unique opportunity exists in Mississippi for building diverse research infrastructure to investigate mechanisms and new treatment options for cardiovascular and renal diseases at the very location where they are most prominent in the United States. This proposal will implement a summer research program in the state of Mississippi that will serve as a pipeline to increase the participation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented minorities in hypertension, renal and cardiovascular related research. The University of Mississippi Medical Center's (UMMC) Cardiovascular and Renal Research Center (CRRC) has a long history of excellence in cardiovascular and renal research. The mission of the CRRC is to prevent and reduce death and disability from diseases of the heart and circulation through excellence in basic and clinical research, education, and improved patient care. One of the major goals of the CRRC is to provide mentoring and training to develop the next generation of cardiovascular and renal researchers. The current proposal represents a critical component of the mission to train and mentor cardiovascular and renal researchers. It will capitalize on the expertise of a strong group of basic science and clinical investigators in cardiovascular and renal research at UMMC to implement a program to promote Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Researchers (DHCR). This will become a robust pipeline by using targeted recruitment at local undergraduate institutions and by utilizing community outreach to increase the visibility of health-related research professions as an exciting career choice among underrepresented minorities. The overall objective of this training program is to provide career and education mentoring along with state-of the art cardiovascular and renal research training experiences to individuals with disadvantaged and underrepresented ethnic or racial backgrounds in the cardiovascular and renal sciences. Undergraduate students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds will participate in this program that has the following aims: (1) To provide a multi-disciplinary training and mentoring experience in cardiovascular and renal research. (2) To provide students with professional skills training geared towards promoting careers in health-related research professions. (3) To develop an educational outreach program that will reinforce and build the pipeline to support a diverse workforce.  Mississippi is among the leaders in health disparities in cardiovascular diseases that disproportionately affect individuals from disadvantaged and underrepresented racial and ethnic populations. At the same time, Mississippi lags in the development of a robust pipeline of biomedical researchers that can address these important issues.

"Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three major academic centers propose to collaborate as a combined clinical-technology site. The 2 clinical centers, NYU School of Medicine and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, have a rich and long history of commitment to SLE and together currently treat ~1,000 SLE patients. They will jointly assemble a renal phenotype-driven patient cohort comprising diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium cohort will be leveraged to develop, standardize and validate advanced technologies to identify critical signaling pathways in tissues (renal and skin), cells and urine. Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium will enroll and follow approximately 300 patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The causes of this potentially fatal, heterogeneous, chronic, and systemic autoimmune disease are not well understood, but its incidence, prevalence and severity are known to be affected by race and ethnicity, as well as socioeconomic status. Our proposed studies will focus on identification of treatable targets specific to kidney injury, and in particular to assess whether similar targets can be identified in cells from the skin, blood or urine which may help to predict kidney disease less invasively and at an earlier stage; the goal is to begin treatment of kidney disease much earlier than is now possible, and ultimately preserve kidney function in patients with SLE.            ",Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium,8851808,UH2AR067689,"['Affect ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' cDNA ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histones ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Genetic Epidemiology of Treatment Resistant Hypertension in African Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Phillips is an internist and Associate Professor of Clinical Medicine at Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA. The candidate's long-term goal is to develop an independent career with expertise in the application of genetic epidemiology, translational research methods and health services research to improve primary prevention, risk stratification and management of cardiovascular disease among racial and ethnic minorities. Dr. Phillips' is committed to developing a research career in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and health disparities. His previous research has been focused on improving quality of care and clinical outcomes with respect to heart failure disease management programs and health disparities. However, during the recent two years the applicant has expanded his research focus to more upstream targets for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease including hypertension which is a common, important modifiable risk factor and an antecedent to cardio-renal dysfunction, particularly in African Americans. Therefore, this career development and clinical research training program will enable the applicant to acquire additional training in genetic epidemiology and translational research including clinical applications of gene- expression, proteomics and biomarker profiling to improve risk stratification and predict disease progression and/or response to therapy. First, the proposed career development plan incorporates a multi-disciplinary training program designed to provide an intense, closely mentored, patient-oriented research experience. Second, the candidate will also enroll in a structured curriculum of didactic coursework in genetic epidemiology, advanced biostatics and longitudinal data management, translational research, clinical trial design and research ethics. Third, the training environment and mentoring team are well aligned to provide both the necessary resources and considerable expertise in genetic epidemiology and translational research, hypertension and vascular dysfunction. The primary mentor is Dr. Gary H. Gibbons who is Director of the Cardiovascular Research Institute (CVRI) at Morehouse School of Medicine and a Co-mentor Dr. Arlene B. Chapman, Director of the Atlanta Clinical and Translational Science Institute (ACTSI) who have established track records of success and experience with mentoring junior faculty and post-doctoral trainees towards independent research careers. Finally, the candidate will also design, implement and complete a clinical research project in order to develop pilot data which will be important for the success of future funding applications on the path to independence. The candidate is interested in the natural history of treatment resistant hypertension (defined as BP>140/90 mmHg despite >3 antihypertensive agents at optimum dose including a diuretic) in African Americans. Hypertension experts suggest prevalence estimates in the range of 8% to 30%. However, epidemiologic studies pertaining to this important public health problem are sparse in African Americans. During the award period, the candidate will design and implement a pilot study of African American subjects (N=247 cases versus N=247 controls with BP <140/90mmHg and <2 drugs) to test a series of interrelated hypotheses: i) African Americans with treatment resistant hypertension have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines), biomarkers of acute and chronic renal injury (microalbuminuria, proteinuria and kidney injury marker-1 [KIM-1]), and increased vascular stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV] and augmentation index [Aix]) compared with age/sex matched controls: ii) Allele frequencies for gain of function angiotensinogen (AGT) variants and AGT levels are significantly higher: iii) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, biomarker of renal injury, AGT variants modify systemic and intra-renal RAAS activation have additive effects on predicting renal dysfunction during follow-up.        This is a pilot study of African American subjects with treatment resistant hypertension (BP >140/90mmHg despite >3 antihypertensive agents at optimum dose including a diuretic versus controls with BP <140/90mmHg and <2 drugs including a diuretic) to test a series of interrelated hypotheses: i) African Americans with treatment resistant hypertension have higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines), biomarkers of acute and chronic renal injury (microalbuminuria, proteinuria and kidney injury marker-1 [KIM-1]), and increased vascular stiffness (pulse wave velocity [PWV] and augmentation index [Aix]) compared with age/sex matched controls: ii) Allele frequencies for gain of function angiotensinogen (AGT) variants and AGT levels are significantly higher: iii) levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, biomarker of renal injury, AGT variants modify systemic and intra-renal RAAS activation and have additive effects on predicting renal dysfunction (incident CKD diagnosis defined as GFR <60ml/min or doubling of serum creatinine) during follow-up.

"Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Robust systems to consent, screen, return results, and to evaluate processes and outcomes of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for common chronic diseases are missing and urgently needed. We propose that hypertension-associated CKD in African ancestry communities has emerged as a highly relevant and well-suited opportunity for a 'prototype' genomic medicine demonstration project that addresses common chronic illnesses managed in primary care settings. African ancestry populations with hypertension (HTN) have 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing CKD, and a 5-fold increased risk to progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared with whites. Recent discoveries demonstrate that testable alleles of the APOL1 locus on chromosome 22 have a major effect on and explain almost all of the excess risk for hypertension-associated CKD and its progression to ESRD in African ancestry populations. In this genomic medicine demonstration pilot project, we plan to implement a cluster randomized trial at primary care facilities of a network of community health centers in Harlem and the Bronx and at Mount Sinai Medical Center. The trial will test whether the desperately low probabilities of correct renal care i.e. appropriate ordering of tests to evaluate CKD and CKD progression, appropriate prescription of renoprotective renin angiotensin blockade, appropriate control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with albuminuria of African ancestry, will be improved significantly in those facilities that receive EMR-enabled renal care CDS incorporating APOL1 genomic risk information compared with those facilities that receive renal care CDS based on conventional risk information only.  The project will have three Specific Aims: 1) Understand knowledge, attitudes, beliefs about testing for APOL1, returning results, and engaging people of African ancestry and their clinicians into a process of testing, counseling and appropriate clinical care. 2) Develop systems and evidence-based advice messages to enable point of care Clinical Decision Support (CDS) for primary care providers advising renal care practice guidelines with our without genomic APOL1 risk information. 3) Conduct a cluster randomized trial assigning eight distinct primary care facilities to receive either renal care CDS with APOL1 genomic risk information (GENOMIC RENAL CARE FACILITY) or with conventional risk information (CONVENTIONAL RENAL CARE FACILITY) to guide primary care for non-diabetic African Americans with hypertension. In the long-term, the proposed genomic medicine demonstration pilot project is expected to generate essential new insights for sustainable adoption and large-scale dissemination of genomic medicine in diverse clinical settings providing care for common adult-onset diseases in general, and for underserved African Ancestry populations with large excess burden of non-diabetic kidney diseases specifically.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will conduct a randomized trial in a network of community health centers and primary care facilities to study the effects and challenges of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for patients of African ancestry with hypertension that are at risk for or have chronic kidney disease. The study will provide information whether patients at primary care facilities where genomic risk information for kidney disease is shared between providers and patients, and patients have different outcomes than patients in facilities where genomic risk information is not shared. This pilot project will create new insights on how genomic medicine approaches will be adopted and whether they can make a difference to improve primary care for hypertensive kidney disease in underserved minorities.                ",Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care,8682897,U01HG007278,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Angiotensins ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Chromosome 22 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22 ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Family ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Medicine ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Probability ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Renin ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' modifiable risk ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' end stage disease ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' randomized trial ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' ']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2014,1260647,0.05762007202718525
"Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (PREP RRT) - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (PREP RRT) Patient education prior to renal replacement therapy (RRT) leads to reduced central venous catheter use, improved access to self-care dialysis such as peritoneal dialysis, and increased access to transplantation. Each of these modalities has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans are less likely than their White counterparts to receive nephrology care prior to dialysis initiation. African Americans are also less likely to hav a fistula for dialysis, to select peritoneal dialysis, and to appear on the renal transplant waitlit. Hospitalization may represent a ""missed opportunity"" to provide RRT education and planning to help patients make informed choices about their care that align with their preferences. Many patients are hospitalized within three months of dialysis initiation. The hospital may also capture patients who are not otherwise well-linked to the medical system. In addition, culturally-tailoring of health education messages through patient narratives has been found to be an effective means of increasing knowledge and motivating behavior change in African American patients. Therefore, I aim to develop, implement, and evaluate a patient-centered referral and education program for RRT (PREP RRT) that incorporates in- person education with a video of culturally-tailored patient narratives for hospitalized African American patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. To effectively implement these goals, I will develop expertise in qualitative research, health education design and behavioral interventions through coursework and mentorship. I have assembled a mentorship and research committee with expertise in reducing health disparities, qualitative methods, hospital-based interventions, multi-media education interventions and chronic kidney disease. I also will complete coursework in the Departments of Health Studies, Sociology and at the University of Illinois School of Public Health related to Survey Research, Qualitative Analysis and Behavior Change Interventions. Through successful implementation of this project, we aim to reduce health disparities and to decrease morbidity, mortality and health care utilization in patients with ESRD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improved patient education prior to renal replacement therapy (RRT) leads to reduced central venous catheter use, improved access to self-care dialysis such as peritoneal dialysis, and increased access to transplant for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Each of these modalities has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of life. While these modalities are underused overall, African Americans are less likely to have a fistula for dialysis, to select peritoneal dialysis, and to appear on the renal transplant waitlist than their White counterparts. This proposal seeks to develop, implement and evaluate a novel patient- centered referral and education program for RRT (PREP RRT) that incorporates in-person education with a video of culturally-tailored patient narratives for hospitalized African American patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The data from this proposal will be critical for the development of future R-01 studies to assess the cost-effectiveness and impact on clinical and public health outcomes of this approach to education and referral for patients with advanced CKD and ESRD.            ",Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (PREP RRT) - Resubmission 01,8968041,K23DK103111,"['Affect ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Arteriovenous Aneurysm ', ' Arteriovenous fistula ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fistula ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Home Renal Dialysis ', ' Home Hemodialyses ', ' Home Hemodialysis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Peritoneal Dialysis ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Sociology ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Misinformation ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Catheters ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Glean ', ' Caring ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Venous ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' education planning ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' common treatment ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K23,2015,178323,0.06495418981049142

"Understanding Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Survival on Dialysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of more than half a million persons suffering from end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, nearly one-third are black, and the relative incidence of ESRD among blacks is 3.6-times higher than that among whites. In a study of 1.3 million incident ESRD patients, we recently showed that black patients under 50 die on dialysis at up to twice the rate of their white counterparts. We hypothesize that the increased dialysis mortality specific to younger black patients results from racial differences among several  interacting components: the biology of renal failure, socioeconomic status (SES) and access to healthcare, and center and network-level factors. Characterizing the underlying mechanisms is critical to improve survival in this population. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms underlying increased mortality for young black patients on dialysis, we propose: 1. To identify subgroups of young ESRD patients in whom racial disparities in dialysis survival are attenuated or amplified, 2. To identify multilevel predictors of reduced survival for younger black patients, and 3.To identify additional factors not captured in the national registry that might explain racia disparities in dialysis survival. The fellowship applicant aspires to become an academic nephrologist, dividing her time between research and patient care. She aspires to use epidemiologic and statistical methods to better understand the mechanisms underlying disease processes and to quantify the effects of treatments, practices, and policies on patient health, with the hope of improving providers' and patients' ability to make informed, evidence-based decisions. Under this fellowship she hopes to complete a combined MD and PhD in epidemiology, which will allow her to build a strong methodological foundation and afford her protected time to produce an integrated body of work addressing a complex research question, facilitating her transition from guided researcher to independent investigator. Specific goals for this fellowship include: 1. Gain exposure to clinical nephrology, 2.Gain exposure to clinical transplant, 3. Achieve a strong foundation in clinical epidemiologic methods, 4. Attain proficiency in advanced statistical methods and further develop statistical programming skills, 5. Enhance skills in scientific discourse and master effective oral and written presentation of scientific findings, 6. Gain experience in the development, conduct, and maintenance of longitudinal cohort studies, 7. Learn to coordinate a multidisciplinary research team, and 8. Develop skills to become an independent investigator. At the start of the funding period, the applicant will be entering her second year of medical training at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She has already completed a masters' degree in epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, and has spent the past 4 years pursuing epidemiologic research full-time in the Johns Hopkins Department of Surgery, under the mentorship of Dr. Dorry Segev, the sponsor of this fellowship. The proposed research seeks to understand the mechanisms underlying disparities in dialysis survival for younger black patients with end-stage renal disease. Patient, center, and regional factors and potential interactions between them will be explored using a variety of epidemiologic approaches. The results will be critical for informing interventions to improve survival in this population.",Understanding Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Survival on Dialysis,8829822,F30DK095545,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Biology ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' hematopoietin ', ' erythrocyte colony stimulating factor ', ' Epoetin ', ' ECSF ', ' Erythropoietin ', ' Fellowship ', ' Fistula ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Persons ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Writing ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Caring ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Subgroup ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2015,48120,0.09222064715860152
"Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Robust systems to consent, screen, return results, and to evaluate processes and outcomes of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for common chronic diseases are missing and urgently needed. We propose that hypertension-associated CKD in African ancestry communities has emerged as a highly relevant and well-suited opportunity for a 'prototype' genomic medicine demonstration project that addresses common chronic illnesses managed in primary care settings. African ancestry populations with hypertension (HTN) have 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing CKD, and a 5-fold increased risk to progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared with whites. Recent discoveries demonstrate that testable alleles of the APOL1 locus on chromosome 22 have a major effect on and explain almost all of the excess risk for hypertension-associated CKD and its progression to ESRD in African ancestry populations. In this genomic medicine demonstration pilot project, we plan to implement a cluster randomized trial at primary care facilities of a network of community health centers in Harlem and the Bronx and at Mount Sinai Medical Center. The trial will test whether the desperately low probabilities of correct renal care i.e. appropriate ordering of tests to evaluate CKD and CKD progression, appropriate prescription of renoprotective renin angiotensin blockade, appropriate control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with albuminuria of African ancestry, will be improved significantly in those facilities that receive EMR-enabled renal care CDS incorporating APOL1 genomic risk information compared with those facilities that receive renal care CDS based on conventional risk information only.  The project will have three Specific Aims: 1) Understand knowledge, attitudes, beliefs about testing for APOL1, returning results, and engaging people of African ancestry and their clinicians into a process of testing, counseling and appropriate clinical care. 2) Develop systems and evidence-based advice messages to enable point of care Clinical Decision Support (CDS) for primary care providers advising renal care practice guidelines with our without genomic APOL1 risk information. 3) Conduct a cluster randomized trial assigning eight distinct primary care facilities to receive either renal care CDS with APOL1 genomic risk information (GENOMIC RENAL CARE FACILITY) or with conventional risk information (CONVENTIONAL RENAL CARE FACILITY) to guide primary care for non-diabetic African Americans with hypertension. In the long-term, the proposed genomic medicine demonstration pilot project is expected to generate essential new insights for sustainable adoption and large-scale dissemination of genomic medicine in diverse clinical settings providing care for common adult-onset diseases in general, and for underserved African Ancestry populations with large excess burden of non-diabetic kidney diseases specifically.

"Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three major academic centers propose to collaborate as a combined clinical-technology site. The 2 clinical centers, NYU School of Medicine and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, have a rich and long history of commitment to SLE and together currently treat ~1,000 SLE patients. They will jointly assemble a renal phenotype-driven patient cohort comprising diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium cohort will be leveraged to develop, standardize and validate advanced technologies to identify critical signaling pathways in tissues (renal and skin), cells and urine. Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium will enroll and follow approximately 300 patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The causes of this potentially fatal, heterogeneous, chronic, and systemic autoimmune disease are not well understood, but its incidence, prevalence and severity are known to be affected by race and ethnicity, as well as socioeconomic status. Our proposed studies will focus on identification of treatable targets specific to kidney injury, and in particular to assess whether similar targets can be identified in cells from the skin, blood or urine which may help to predict kidney disease less invasively and at an earlier stage; the goal is to begin treatment of kidney disease much earlier than is now possible, and ultimately preserve kidney function in patients with SLE.",Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium,8932655,UH2AR067689,"['Affect ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' cDNA ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Head ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histones ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Mississippi Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Researchers Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mississippi is among the leaders in mortality due to heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and kidney disease. Mississippi also has the greatest health care disparities in the country along with limited extramural research support necessary to recruit and retain top biomedical researchers that can address these important issues. These widening health care disparities affect underrepresented minorities, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans, who are disproportionately affected by heart disease, stroke, diabetes, nephritis/nephrosis, hypertension and hypertension related renal diseases. Therefore, a unique opportunity exists in Mississippi for building diverse research infrastructure to investigate mechanisms and new treatment options for cardiovascular and renal diseases at the very location where they are most prominent in the United States. This proposal will implement a summer research program in the state of Mississippi that will serve as a pipeline to increase the participation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented minorities in hypertension, renal and cardiovascular related research. The University of Mississippi Medical Center's (UMMC) Cardiovascular and Renal Research Center (CRRC) has a long history of excellence in cardiovascular and renal research. The mission of the CRRC is to prevent and reduce death and disability from diseases of the heart and circulation through excellence in basic and clinical research, education, and improved patient care. One of the major goals of the CRRC is to provide mentoring and training to develop the next generation of cardiovascular and renal researchers. The current proposal represents a critical component of the mission to train and mentor cardiovascular and renal researchers. It will capitalize on the expertise of a strong group of basic science and clinical investigators in cardiovascular and renal research at UMMC to implement a program to promote Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Researchers (DHCR). This will become a robust pipeline by using targeted recruitment at local undergraduate institutions and by utilizing community outreach to increase the visibility of health-related research professions as an exciting career choice among underrepresented minorities. The overall objective of this training program is to provide career and education mentoring along with state-of the art cardiovascular and renal research training experiences to individuals with disadvantaged and underrepresented ethnic or racial backgrounds in the cardiovascular and renal sciences.

"Sodium-restricted diets and symptoms in end stage renal disease: An RCT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary sodium intake independently increases mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The benefits of sodium restriction in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are consistently demonstrated in scientific reports, though little is known about the appropriate prescription of dietary sodium intake. Specifically, there is a lack of evidence of either harm or benefit of universal practiced recommendations. The overall objective of the proposed NINR Career Development Award is to receive advanced research training in: (1) Renal physiology including fluid and electrolyte balance, the physiology and mechanics of HD therapy and body composition; and the role of nutrition in management of ESRD; (2) Symptom science in patients with ESRD, the scientific rationale for symptom management, and how symptoms are related to physiological and nutritional changes; (3) Methods and measurement strategies of renal-related physiological variables, biological markers, and patient symptoms; (4) Repeated measures, longitudinal data analysis of physiologic variables; (5) Bioethics of studying vulnerable populations with chronic illness and how that content relates to the responsible conduct of research (RCR), and data/safety monitoring and randomized controlled trials (RCT). As part of my career development, I will conduct an RCT to study the effects of three levels of sodium intake (ambient control group [CG], 1500 mg/d [1.5G], 2400 mg/d [2.4G]) on the HD symptom profile of ESRD patients. The proposed study will be the first of its kind to offer empiric support for or against the current dietary sodium intake recommendations. The study will provide the first step to gathering essential evidence needed to correctly identify the appropriate dietary sodium restriction prescription.

"Sodium-restricted diets and symptoms in end stage renal disease: An RCT     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dietary sodium intake independently increases mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). The benefits of sodium restriction in patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD) are consistently demonstrated in scientific reports, though little is known about the appropriate prescription of dietary sodium intake. Specifically, there is a lack of evidence of either harm or benefit of universal practiced recommendations. The overall objective of the proposed NINR Career Development Award is to receive advanced research training in: (1) Renal physiology including fluid and electrolyte balance, the physiology and mechanics of HD therapy and body composition; and the role of nutrition in management of ESRD; (2) Symptom science in patients with ESRD, the scientific rationale for symptom management, and how symptoms are related to physiological and nutritional changes; (3) Methods and measurement strategies of renal-related physiological variables, biological markers, and patient symptoms; (4) Repeated measures, longitudinal data analysis of physiologic variables; (5) Bioethics of studying vulnerable populations with chronic illness and how that content relates to the responsible conduct of research (RCR), and data/safety monitoring and randomized controlled trials (RCT). As part of my career development, I will conduct an RCT to study the effects of three levels of sodium intake (ambient control group [CG], 1500 mg/d [1.5G], 2400 mg/d [2.4G]) on the HD symptom profile of ESRD patients. The proposed study will be the first of its kind to offer empiric support for or against the current dietary sodium intake recommendations. The study will provide the first step to gathering essential evidence needed to correctly identify the appropriate dietary sodium restriction prescription. The specific aims are to: 1) demonstrate that symptom profiles and interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) vary among three sodium intake groups (CG, sodium intake of 1.5G, sodium intake of 2.4G), controlling for age, race, gender, and duration of disease; 2) demonstrate that the effect of HD-specific variables [ultrafiltration rate (liters/hour) and total luid removed (liters)] on the symptom profiles vary among the three sodium intake groups (CG, 1.5G, 2.4G), controlling for age, race, gender, and duration of disease; 3) determine whether total body water (TBW), extracellular fluid (ECF), and intracellular (ICF) measured with bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) varies across sodium intake groups (CG, 1.5G, 2.4G), controlling for age, race, gender, and duration of disease.

"Risk Clustering and Stratification in Genetically High-Risk Individuals Using Electronic Medical Records and Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a revised submission for a K23 award by Dr. Girish Nadkarni at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Nadkarni is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease. This project will try to improve risk prediction and stratification for kidney disease progression in minority populations at baseline high genetic risk due to Apolipoprotein1 (APOL1) variants. Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Girish Nadkarni's career development into an independent investigator in the field of leveraging biomarkers, genomics and “big data” approaches for renal research. Dr. Nadkarni's career goal is to accurately risk stratify patients for renal functional decline for future targeted enrolment into clinical trials evaluating novel interventions. To achieve these goals, Dr. Nadkarni has assembled a mentoring and advisory team led by a primary mentor, Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor and Director of Clinical Research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and a co-mentor Dr. Erwin Bottinger, Professor of Medicine and former Director of The Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine. His advisory team consists of Dr. Emilia Bagiella, Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at Mount Sinai and an expert in longitudinal analysis; Dr. Eimear Kenny, Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Genomics and an expert in statistical and population genetics; Dr. Avi Ma'ayan, an Associate Professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics and an expert in bioinformatics and Dr. Judy Cho, the incoming director of the Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine and an expert in translational genetics. His proposed training plan focuses on four areas (1) Advanced Statistical and Epidemiological Methodology; (2) Biomarker Methodology; (3) Computational Bioinformatics and Programming and (4) Focused mentorship and career development. Environment: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research and is one of the top 20 medical schools in NIH funding. ISMMS was also named as one of the ""The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies In Big Data"" due to its computing resources and the BioMe Biobank, whose primary architect is Dr.Bottinger and is currently led by Dr. Cho. Research: Ethnic minorities are at higher risk of both development and progression of chronic kidney disease. This has been linked in part to risk variants in the APOL1 gene that are present in up to 14% in populations of African descent (including African Americans [AAs] and Hispanic Latinos [HLas]) but are absent in non- Hispanic Whites. Although APOL1 high-risk genotype is, in general, associated with faster eGFR decline, only about 50% progress to ESRD and patients within this group have differing rates of renal functional decline. Thus, risk stratification within this group is poor, limiting early intervention. With a large proportion of vulnerable ethnic minorities at increased risk, innovative methods for predicting renal function decline within this genetically high-risk group are urgently needed. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) Establish associations of clinical predictors, lifestyle factors and laboratory parameters with longitudinal eGFR decline in AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; (2) To develop a novel plasma biomarker panel assessing inflammation, injury, vascular insult and fibrosis, for risk prognostication of longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; and (3) To conduct comprehensive, external validation of the highest performing plasma biomarkers and traditional predictors and derive risk clusters using validated predictors for longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLa's with APOL1 high-risk genotype. Aims 1 and 2 will be conducted using the largest cohort of participants with APOL1 risk variants ever assembled (n=809). Aim 3 will be conducted using four external cohorts, the Vanderbilt BioVU cohort, the Genetic testing to Understand and Address Renal Disease Disparities (GUARDD) study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC). These approaches integrating genetic, biomarker and electronic medical record clinical information, will form the basis for future work investigating targeted enrolment of high-risk patients in pragmatic, randomized controlled trials for early interventions, which will be proposed in an R01 application before the end of the K award period. PROJECT NARRATIVE APOL1 genetic variants have emerged as a key risk factor for renal disease risk in ethnic minorities. However, only a fraction of those who are APOL1 high-risk progress to renal failure. We plan to use commonly collected clinical information and novel plasma proteins to accurately identify subsets of patients within this genetically high-risk group for early identification and interventions and in the process, train Dr. Girish N. Nadkarni, to accelerate his progress towards being an independent clinical and translational investigator in the field of utilizing big data in nephrology.",Risk Clustering and Stratification in

"Understanding Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Survival on Dialysis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of more than half a million persons suffering from end stage renal disease (ESRD) in the United States, nearly one-third are black, and the relative incidence of ESRD among blacks is 3.6-times higher than that among whites. In a study of 1.3 million incident ESRD patients, we recently showed that black patients under 50 die on dialysis at up to twice the rate of their white counterparts. We hypothesize that the increased dialysis mortality specific to younger black patients results from racial differences among several  interacting components: the biology of renal failure, socioeconomic status (SES) and access to healthcare, and center and network-level factors. Characterizing the underlying mechanisms is critical to improve survival in this population. In an effort to better understand the mechanisms underlying increased mortality for young black patients on dialysis, we propose: 1. To identify subgroups of young ESRD patients in whom racial disparities in dialysis survival are attenuated or amplified, 2. To identify multilevel predictors of reduced survival for younger black patients, and 3.To identify additional factors not captured in the national registry that might explain racia disparities in dialysis survival. The fellowship applicant aspires to become an academic nephrologist, dividing her time between research and patient care. She aspires to use epidemiologic and statistical methods to better understand the mechanisms underlying disease processes and to quantify the effects of treatments, practices, and policies on patient health, with the hope of improving providers' and patients' ability to make informed, evidence-based decisions. Under this fellowship she hopes to complete a combined MD and PhD in epidemiology, which will allow her to build a strong methodological foundation and afford her protected time to produce an integrated body of work addressing a complex research question, facilitating her transition from guided researcher to independent investigator. Specific goals for this fellowship include: 1. Gain exposure to clinical nephrology, 2.Gain exposure to clinical transplant, 3. Achieve a strong foundation in clinical epidemiologic methods, 4. Attain proficiency in advanced statistical methods and further develop statistical programming skills, 5. Enhance skills in scientific discourse and master effective oral and written presentation of scientific findings, 6. Gain experience in the development, conduct, and maintenance of longitudinal cohort studies, 7. Learn to coordinate a multidisciplinary research team, and 8. Develop skills to become an independent investigator. At the start of the funding period, the applicant will be entering her second year of medical training at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She has already completed a masters' degree in epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, and has spent the past 4 years pursuing epidemiologic research full-time in the Johns Hopkins Department of Surgery, under the mentorship of Dr. Dorry Segev, the sponsor of this fellowship. The proposed research seeks to understand the mechanisms underlying disparities in dialysis survival for younger black patients with end-stage renal disease. Patient, center, and regional factors and potential interactions between them will be explored using a variety of epidemiologic approaches. The results will be critical for informing interventions to improve survival in this population.",Understanding Mechanisms for Racial Disparities in Survival on Dialysis,9045613,F30DK095545,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Biology ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' hematopoietin ', ' erythrocyte colony stimulating factor ', ' Epoetin ', ' ECSF ', ' Erythropoietin ', ' Fellowship ', ' Fistula ', ' Foundations ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Incidence ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' Learning ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Survival Analyses ', ' Survival Analysis ', ' Time ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Weight ', ' Writing ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Caring ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Location ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' experience ', ' hazard ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', "" Master's Degree "", ' Subgroup ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Population ', ' treatment effect ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' evidence base ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIDDK,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F30,2016,48576,0.09222064715860152
"Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Robust systems to consent, screen, return results, and to evaluate processes and outcomes of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for common chronic diseases are missing and urgently needed. We propose that hypertension-associated CKD in African ancestry communities has emerged as a highly relevant and well-suited opportunity for a 'prototype' genomic medicine demonstration project that addresses common chronic illnesses managed in primary care settings. African ancestry populations with hypertension (HTN) have 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing CKD, and a 5-fold increased risk to progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared with whites. Recent discoveries demonstrate that testable alleles of the APOL1 locus on chromosome 22 have a major effect on and explain almost all of the excess risk for hypertension-associated CKD and its progression to ESRD in African ancestry populations. In this genomic medicine demonstration pilot project, we plan to implement a cluster randomized trial at primary care facilities of a network of community health centers in Harlem and the Bronx and at Mount Sinai Medical Center. The trial will test whether the desperately low probabilities of correct renal care i.e. appropriate ordering of tests to evaluate CKD and CKD progression, appropriate prescription of renoprotective renin angiotensin blockade, appropriate control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with albuminuria of African ancestry, will be improved significantly in those facilities that receive EMR-enabled renal care CDS incorporating APOL1 genomic risk information compared with those facilities that receive renal care CDS based on conventional risk information only.  The project will have three Specific Aims: 1) Understand knowledge, attitudes, beliefs about testing for APOL1, returning results, and engaging people of African ancestry and their clinicians into a process of testing, counseling and appropriate clinical care. 2) Develop systems and evidence-based advice messages to enable point of care Clinical Decision Support (CDS) for primary care providers advising renal care practice guidelines with our without genomic APOL1 risk information. 3) Conduct a cluster randomized trial assigning eight distinct primary care facilities to receive either renal care CDS with APOL1 genomic risk information (GENOMIC RENAL CARE FACILITY) or with conventional risk information (CONVENTIONAL RENAL CARE FACILITY) to guide primary care for non-diabetic African Americans with hypertension. In the long-term, the proposed genomic medicine demonstration pilot project is expected to generate essential new insights for sustainable adoption and large-scale dissemination of genomic medicine in diverse clinical settings providing care for common adult-onset diseases in general, and for underserved African Ancestry populations with large excess burden of non-diabetic kidney diseases specifically. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will conduct a randomized trial in a network of community health centers and primary care facilities to study the effects and challenges of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for patients of African ancestry with hypertension that are at risk for or have chronic kidney disease. The study will provide information whether patients at primary care facilities where genomic risk information for kidney disease is shared between providers and patients, and patients have different outcomes than patients in facilities where genomic risk information is not shared. This pilot project will create new insights on how genomic medicine approaches will be adopted and whether they can make a difference to improve primary care for hypertensive kidney disease in underserved minorities.",Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care,9091594,U01HG007278,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Angiotensins ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Chromosome 22 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22 ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Probability ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Renin ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' modifiable risk ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' end stage disease ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' underserved minority ', ' ']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2016,1274890,0.05762007202718525
"Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three major academic centers propose to collaborate as a combined clinical-technology site. The 2 clinical centers, NYU School of Medicine and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, have a rich and long history of commitment to SLE and together currently treat ~1,000 SLE patients. They will jointly assemble a renal phenotype-driven patient cohort comprising diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium cohort will be leveraged to develop, standardize and validate advanced technologies to identify critical signaling pathways in tissues (renal and skin), cells and urine. Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium will enroll and follow approximately 300 patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The causes of this potentially fatal, heterogeneous, chronic, and systemic autoimmune disease are not well understood, but its incidence, prevalence and severity are known to be affected by race and ethnicity, as well as socioeconomic status. Our proposed studies will focus on identification of treatable targets specific to kidney injury, and in particular to assess whether similar targets can be identified in cells from the skin, blood or urine which may help to predict kidney disease less invasively and at an earlier stage; the goal is to begin treatment of kidney disease much earlier than is now possible, and ultimately preserve kidney function in patients with SLE.",Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium,9278769,UH2AR067689,"['Affect ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Antibodies ', '

"Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Augmented intrarenal angiotensinogen (AGT) is a critical contributor to the activation of intrarenal renin- angiotensin system (RAS) which leads to the development of hypertension and associated tissue injury. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms underlying AGT upregulation is essential for the development of strategies to treat these diseases. Chronic Ang II elevation induces increased immune cell infiltration in the kidneys contributing to increase in intrarenal cytokine levels specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6). Notably, IL-6 is required for Ang II-induced AGT augmentation in renal proximal tubular cells (PTC). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions leading to AGT augmentation have not been delineated. Renal cortical AGT levels are lower in female rodents than in males under normal conditions; however, plasma and liver AGT levels do not exhibit this gender disparity, suggesting that kidneys have a unique mechanism inherent to establishing basal AGT levels. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) levels are higher in the kidneys of female rats than those of male rats and that HDAC9 inhibitions by siRNA and an inhibitor resulted in augmentation of AGT levels in PTC. These results indicate that HDAC9 is a suppressor of intrarenal AGT expression. Since HDACs suppress gene transcription by histone-deacetylation, changes in HDAC levels alter accessibility of activated transcription factors to their binding sites on gene promoters. The preliminary study showed that HDAC9 levels are decreased by Ang II in PTC. Accordingly, we hypothesize that downregulation of HDAC9 by Ang II reduces the suppressive effects of HDAC9 on AGT expression. This allows other transcription factors activated by pathological stimuli, in particula IL-6, to augment AGT expression, thus leading to the progression of hypertension and associated tissue injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. To address this hypothesis, we will establish that Ang II suppresses intrarenal HDAC9 levels during the development of Ang II-dependent hypertension using unique PTC and Ang II- dependent hypertensive animal models (Specific Aim 1). In addition, the proposed studies will demonstrate that Ang II-induced intrarenal HDAC9 downregulation is required for intrarenal AGT augmentation by synergistic effects of Ang II and IL-6 and consequent development of hypertension (Specific Aim 2). In these experiments, HDAC9 knockdown by siRNA and overexpression via AAV2 infection will be used to show that the HDAC9 knockdown and IL-6 synergistically augment AGT expression in PTC and that kidney-specific HDAC9 overexpression attenuates intrarenal AGT elevation facilitating consequent the development of kidney injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. Gender differences of intrarenal HDAC9 regulation and its contribution to AGT regulation in hypertension will also be investigated in the projects. The results will establish the cardinal rol of intrarenal HDAC9 in the regulation of intrarenal AGT in Ang II-dependent hypertension and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting HDAC9 to treat hypertension and RAS associated tissue injury.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Angiotensinogen (AGT) regulation in the kidney is a key contributor to the hypertensive process. The overall goal of this project is to show an enzyme, HDAC9, regulates AGT levels in the kidney during progression of hypertension using genetically modified cell and animal models. The outcomes are expected to provide a novel and more effective approach for curtailing the development of hypertension and kidney injury and may facilitate clinical efforts to drastically reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with hypertension.            ","Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension",9008798,R01DK107694,"['Aldosterone ', ' Renin-Substrate ', ' Proangiotensin ', ' Hypertensinogen ', ' Angiotensinogen ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' HDAC ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Infection ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' male ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Renin ', ' Renin-Angiotensin System ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transfection ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Injury ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Stimulus ', ' Attenuated ', ' Tubular ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Infiltration ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment duration ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' Renal Cell ', ' kidney cell ', ' ATF ', ' activating transcription factor ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' siRNA ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' Histone Deacetylation ', ' kidney development ', ' nephrogenesis ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' in vivo ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Outcome ', ' genetically modified cells ', ' genetically engineered cells ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' public health relevance ', ' HDAC9 gene ', ' MITR protein ', ' MITR gene ', ' MEF2-Interacting Transcription Repressor Protein ', ' KIAA0744 ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9A ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9 ', ' Histone Deacetylase 7B ', ' HDAC9A ', ' HDAC9 ', ' HDAC7B ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender disparity ', ' ']",NIDDK,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2016,270900,0.03783790743639386
"Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Robust systems to consent, screen, return results, and to evaluate processes and outcomes of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for common chronic diseases are missing and urgently needed. We propose that hypertension-associated CKD in African ancestry communities has emerged as a highly relevant and well-suited opportunity for a 'prototype' genomic medicine demonstration project that addresses common chronic illnesses managed in primary care settings. African ancestry populations with hypertension (HTN) have 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing CKD, and a 5-fold increased risk to progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared with whites. Recent discoveries demonstrate that testable alleles of the APOL1 locus on chromosome 22 have a major effect on and explain almost all of the excess risk for hypertension-associated CKD and its progression to ESRD in African ancestry populations. In this genomic medicine demonstration pilot project, we plan to implement a cluster randomized trial at primary care facilities of a network of community health centers in Harlem and the Bronx and at Mount Sinai Medical Center.

"Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (PREP RRT) - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (PREP RRT) Patient education prior to renal replacement therapy (RRT) leads to reduced central venous catheter use, improved access to self-care dialysis such as peritoneal dialysis, and increased access to transplantation. Each of these modalities has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans are less likely than their White counterparts to receive nephrology care prior to dialysis initiation. African Americans are also less likely to hav a fistula for dialysis, to select peritoneal dialysis, and to appear on the renal transplant waitlit. Hospitalization may represent a ""missed opportunity"" to provide RRT education and planning to help patients make informed choices about their care that align with their preferences. Many patients are hospitalized within three months of dialysis initiation. The hospital may also capture patients who are not otherwise well-linked to the medical system. In addition, culturally-tailoring of health education messages through patient narratives has been found to be an effective means of increasing knowledge and motivating behavior change in African American patients. Therefore, I aim to develop, implement, and evaluate a patient-centered referral and education program for RRT (PREP RRT) that incorporates in- person education with a video of culturally-tailored patient narratives for hospitalized African American patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. To effectively implement these goals, I will develop expertise in qualitative research, health education design and behavioral interventions through coursework and mentorship. I have assembled a mentorship and research committee with expertise in reducing health disparities, qualitative methods, hospital-based interventions, multi-media education interventions and chronic kidney disease. I also will complete coursework in the Departments of Health Studies, Sociology and at the University of Illinois School of Public Health related to Survey Research, Qualitative Analysis and Behavior Change Interventions. Through successful implementation of this project, we aim to reduce health disparities and to decrease morbidity, mortality and health care utilization in patients with ESRD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improved patient education prior to renal replacement therapy (RRT) leads to reduced central venous catheter use, improved access to self-care dialysis such as peritoneal dialysis, and increased access to transplant for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Each of these modalities has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of life. While these modalities are underused overall, African Americans are less likely to have a fistula for dialysis, to select peritoneal dialysis, and to appear on the renal transplant waitlist than their White counterparts. This proposal seeks to develop, implement and evaluate a novel patient- centered referral and education program for RRT (PREP RRT) that incorporates in-person education with a video of culturally-tailored patient narratives for hospitalized African American patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The data from this proposal will be critical for the development of future R-01 studies to assess the cost-effectiveness and impact on clinical and public health outcomes of this approach to education and referral for patients with advanced CKD and ESRD.",Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (PREP RRT) - Resubmission 01,9115607,K23DK103111,"['Affect ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Arteriovenous Aneurysm ', ' Arteriovenous fistula ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fistula ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Home Renal Dialysis ', ' Home Hemodialyses ', ' Home Hemodialysis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Peritoneal Dialysis ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Sociology ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Survival Rate ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Misinformation ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Catheters ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Glean ', ' Caring ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Venous ', ' transplant patient ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' education planning ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' common treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K23,2016,176823,0.06495418981049142
"Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three major academic centers propose to collaborate as a combined clinical-technology site. The 2 clinical centers, NYU School of Medicine and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, have a rich and long history of commitment to SLE and together currently treat ~1,000 SLE patients. They will jointly assemble a renal phenotype-driven patient cohort comprising diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium cohort will be leveraged to develop, standardize and validate advanced technologies to identify critical signaling pathways in tissues (renal and skin), cells and urine. Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium will enroll and follow approximately 300 patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Our proposed studies will focus on identification of treatable targets specific to kidney injury, and in particular to assess whether similar targets can be identified in cells from the skin, blood or

"Mississippi Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Researchers Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mississippi is among the leaders in mortality due to heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and kidney disease. Mississippi also has the greatest health care disparities in the country along with limited extramural research support necessary to recruit and retain top biomedical researchers that can address these important issues. These widening health care disparities affect underrepresented minorities, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans, who are disproportionately affected by heart disease, stroke, diabetes, nephritis/nephrosis, hypertension and hypertension related renal diseases. Therefore, a unique opportunity exists in Mississippi for building diverse research infrastructure to investigate mechanisms and new treatment options for cardiovascular and renal diseases at the very location where they are most prominent in the United States. This proposal will implement a summer research program in the state of Mississippi that will serve as a pipeline to increase the participation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented minorities in hypertension, renal and cardiovascular related research. The University of Mississippi Medical Center's (UMMC) Cardiovascular and Renal Research Center (CRRC) has a long history of excellence in cardiovascular and renal research. The mission of the CRRC is to prevent and reduce death and disability from diseases of the heart and circulation through excellence in basic and clinical research, education, and improved patient care. One of the major goals of the CRRC is to provide mentoring and training to develop the next generation of cardiovascular and renal researchers. The current proposal represents a critical component of the mission to train and mentor cardiovascular and renal researchers. It will capitalize on the expertise of a strong group of basic science and clinical investigators in cardiovascular and renal research at UMMC to implement a program to promote Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Researchers (DHCR). This will become a robust pipeline by using targeted recruitment at local undergraduate institutions and by utilizing community outreach to increase the visibility of health-related research professions as an exciting career choice among underrepresented minorities. The overall objective of this training program is to provide career and education mentoring along with state-of the art cardiovascular and renal research training experiences to individuals with disadvantaged and underrepresented ethnic or racial backgrounds in the cardiovascular and renal sciences.

"Low Birth Weight, Blood Pressure, and Kidney Disease Project Summary Low birth weight (LBW) is an important risk factor for hypertension, cardiovascular and kidney disease; however, the mechanisms by which an adverse fetal environment programs risk for adult disease are poorly understood. Because this risk factor is determined at the beginning of a person’s lifespan, a better understanding of developmental programming can provide insight that improves early disease prevention and intervention to drastically reduce the burden of disease in later adulthood. Novel findings in this area also have great potential to reduce health disparities, as African-Americans are disproportionately affected by LBW and other conditions linked to this risk factor including hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Placental insufficiency is the most common cause of LBW in the Western world, and the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) animal model of preeclampsia mimics the same health effects seen in human offspring, including the sex differences in how programming influences cardio-renal disease. Evidence suggests that renal inflammation plays a mediatorial role in the link between hypertension and kidney damage. The objective of this project is to study the effects of chronic elevations in blood pressure on renal health in intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) offspring, and to elucidate the mechanisms by which changes during development lead to increased renal risk in later life in a sex-specific manner. This will be done by inducing a secondary insult of reduced renal mass by uni-nephrectomy in 18 month old IUGR offspring, and comparing physiological indicators of renal function as well as molecular and histological markers of tissue injury between control and IUGR males and females. Blood pressure-lowering and anti-inflammatory medications will also be used to determine whether early intervention can prevent this renal damage in response to an insult. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that intrauterine growth restriction programs a long-term increase in blood pressure in males that initiates a progressive accelerated age-related decline in renal function leading to an enhanced susceptibility to renal injury in growth-restricted rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that intrauterine growth restriction programs enhanced up-regulation of renal TNF-α and TGF-β1 in response to a secondary renal insult that contributes to enhanced susceptibility to renal injury in growth-restricted rats. Project Narrative Low birth weight is an important risk factor for hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding how low birth weight increases the risk for hypertension and chronic kidney disease is important in developing early interventions and better therapeutics for these conditions. This research seeks to understand the role of inflammatory cytokines in linking high blood pressure and kidney damage, and how these effects differ between low birth weight males and females.","Low Birth Weight, Blood Pressure, and Kidney Disease",9378059,F30DK112718,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Neoplasms ', ' Renal Tumor ', ' Renal Neoplasms ', ' Kidney Tumor ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' male ', ' Mississippi ', ' Morbidity -

"Risk Clustering and Stratification in Genetically High-Risk Individuals Using Electronic Medical Records and Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a revised submission for a K23 award by Dr. Girish Nadkarni at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Nadkarni is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease. This project will try to improve risk prediction and stratification for kidney disease progression in minority populations at baseline high genetic risk due to Apolipoprotein1 (APOL1) variants. Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Girish Nadkarni's career development into an independent investigator in the field of leveraging biomarkers, genomics and “big data” approaches for renal research. Dr. Nadkarni's career goal is to accurately risk stratify patients for renal functional decline for future targeted enrolment into clinical trials evaluating novel interventions. To achieve these goals, Dr. Nadkarni has assembled a mentoring and advisory team led by a primary mentor, Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor and Director of Clinical Research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and a co-mentor Dr. Erwin Bottinger, Professor of Medicine and former Director of The Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine. His advisory team consists of Dr. Emilia Bagiella, Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at Mount Sinai and an expert in longitudinal analysis; Dr. Eimear Kenny, Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Genomics and an expert in statistical and population genetics; Dr. Avi Ma'ayan, an Associate Professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics and an expert in bioinformatics and Dr. Judy Cho, the incoming director of the Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine and an expert in translational genetics. His proposed training plan focuses on four areas (1) Advanced Statistical and Epidemiological Methodology; (2) Biomarker Methodology; (3) Computational Bioinformatics and Programming and (4) Focused mentorship and career development. Environment: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research and is one of the top 20 medical schools in NIH funding. ISMMS was also named as one of the ""The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies In Big Data"" due to its computing resources and the BioMe Biobank, whose primary architect is Dr.Bottinger and is currently led by Dr. Cho. Research: Ethnic minorities are at higher risk of both development and progression of chronic kidney disease. This has been linked in part to risk variants in the APOL1 gene that are present in up to 14% in populations of African descent (including African Americans [AAs] and Hispanic Latinos [HLas]) but are absent in non- Hispanic Whites. Although APOL1 high-risk genotype is, in general, associated with faster eGFR decline, only about 50% progress to ESRD and patients within this group have differing rates of renal functional decline. Thus, risk stratification within this group is poor, limiting early intervention. With a large proportion of vulnerable ethnic minorities at increased risk, innovative methods for predicting renal function decline within this genetically high-risk group are urgently needed. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) Establish associations of clinical predictors, lifestyle factors and laboratory parameters with longitudinal eGFR decline in AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; (2) To develop a novel plasma biomarker panel assessing inflammation, injury, vascular insult and fibrosis, for risk prognostication of longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; and (3) To conduct comprehensive, external validation of the highest performing plasma biomarkers and traditional predictors and derive risk clusters using validated predictors for longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLa's with APOL1 high-risk genotype. Aims 1 and 2 will be conducted using the largest cohort of participants with APOL1 risk variants ever assembled (n=809). Aim 3 will be conducted using four external cohorts, the Vanderbilt BioVU cohort, the Genetic testing to Understand and Address Renal Disease Disparities (GUARDD) study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC). These approaches integrating genetic, biomarker and electronic medical record clinical information, will form the basis for future work investigating targeted enrolment of high-risk patients in pragmatic, randomized controlled trials for early interventions, which will be proposed in an R01 application before the end of the K award period. PROJECT NARRATIVE APOL1 genetic variants have emerged as a key risk factor for renal disease risk in ethnic minorities. However, only a fraction of those who are APOL1 high-risk progress to renal failure. We plan to use commonly collected clinical information and novel plasma proteins to accurately identify subsets of patients within this genetically high-risk group for early identification and interventions and in the process, train Dr. Girish N. Nadkarni, to accelerate his progress towards being an independent clinical and translational investigator in the field of utilizing big data in nephrology.",Risk Clustering and Stratification in

"Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three major academic centers propose to collaborate as a combined clinical-technology site. The 2 clinical centers, NYU School of Medicine and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, have a rich and long history of commitment to SLE and together currently treat ~1,000 SLE patients. They will jointly assemble a renal phenotype-driven patient cohort comprising diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium cohort will be leveraged to develop, standardize and validate advanced technologies to identify critical signaling pathways in tissues (renal and skin), cells and urine. Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium will enroll and follow approximately 300 patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The causes of this potentially fatal, heterogeneous, chronic, and systemic autoimmune disease are not well understood, but its incidence, prevalence and severity are known to be affected by race and ethnicity, as well as socioeconomic status. Our proposed studies will focus on identification of treatable targets specific to kidney injury, and in particular to assess whether similar targets can be identified in cells from the skin, blood or urine which may help to predict kidney disease less invasively and at an earlier stage; the goal is to begin treatment of kidney disease much earlier than is now possible, and ultimately preserve kidney function in patients with SLE.",Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium,9542609,UH2AR067689,"['Affect ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Antibodies ', '

"Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Robust systems to consent, screen, return results, and to evaluate processes and outcomes of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for common chronic diseases are missing and urgently needed. We propose that hypertension-associated CKD in African ancestry communities has emerged as a highly relevant and well-suited opportunity for a 'prototype' genomic medicine demonstration project that addresses common chronic illnesses managed in primary care settings. African ancestry populations with hypertension (HTN) have 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing CKD, and a 5-fold increased risk to progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared with whites. Recent discoveries demonstrate that testable alleles of the APOL1 locus on chromosome 22 have a major effect on and explain almost all of the excess risk for hypertension-associated CKD and its progression to ESRD in African ancestry populations. In this genomic medicine demonstration pilot project, we plan to implement a cluster randomized trial at primary care facilities of a network of community health centers in Harlem and the Bronx and at Mount Sinai Medical Center. The trial will test whether the desperately low probabilities of correct renal care i.e. appropriate ordering of tests to evaluate CKD and CKD progression, appropriate prescription of renoprotective renin angiotensin blockade, appropriate control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with albuminuria of African ancestry, will be improved significantly in those facilities that receive EMR-enabled renal care CDS incorporating APOL1 genomic risk information compared with those facilities that receive renal care CDS based on conventional risk information only.  The project will have three Specific Aims: 1) Understand knowledge, attitudes, beliefs about testing for APOL1, returning results, and engaging people of African ancestry and their clinicians into a process of testing, counseling and appropriate clinical care. 2) Develop systems and evidence-based advice messages to enable point of care Clinical Decision Support (CDS) for primary care providers advising renal care practice guidelines with our without genomic APOL1 risk information. 3) Conduct a cluster randomized trial assigning eight distinct primary care facilities to receive either renal care CDS with APOL1 genomic risk information (GENOMIC RENAL CARE FACILITY) or with conventional risk information (CONVENTIONAL RENAL CARE FACILITY) to guide primary care for non-diabetic African Americans with hypertension. In the long-term, the proposed genomic medicine demonstration pilot project is expected to generate essential new insights for sustainable adoption and large-scale dissemination of genomic medicine in diverse clinical settings providing care for common adult-onset diseases in general, and for underserved African Ancestry populations with large excess burden of non-diabetic kidney diseases specifically. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will conduct a randomized trial in a network of community health centers and primary care facilities to study the effects and challenges of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for patients of African ancestry with hypertension that are at risk for or have chronic kidney disease. The study will provide information whether patients at primary care facilities where genomic risk information for kidney disease is shared between providers and patients, and patients have different outcomes than patients in facilities where genomic risk information is not shared. This pilot project will create new insights on how genomic medicine approaches will be adopted and whether they can make a difference to improve primary care for hypertensive kidney disease in underserved minorities.",Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care,9402857,U01HG007278,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Angiotensins ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Chromosome 22 ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22 ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Counseling ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Probability ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renin ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Institution ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' modifiable risk ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' end stage disease ', ' exome ', ' exomes ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' underserved minority ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' ']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2017,680814,0.05762007202718525
"Mississippi Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Researchers Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mississippi is among the leaders in mortality due to heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and kidney disease. Mississippi also has the greatest health care disparities in the country along with limited extramural research support necessary to recruit and retain top biomedical researchers that can address these important issues. These widening health care disparities affect underrepresented minorities, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans, who are disproportionately affected by heart disease, stroke, diabetes, nephritis/nephrosis, hypertension and hypertension related renal diseases. Therefore, a unique opportunity exists in Mississippi for building diverse research infrastructure to investigate mechanisms and new treatment options for cardiovascular and renal diseases at the very location where they are most prominent in the United States. This proposal will implement a summer research program in the state of Mississippi that will serve as a pipeline to increase the participation of individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented minorities in hypertension, renal and cardiovascular related research.

"Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Augmented intrarenal angiotensinogen (AGT) is a critical contributor to the activation of intrarenal renin- angiotensin system (RAS) which leads to the development of hypertension and associated tissue injury. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms underlying AGT upregulation is essential for the development of strategies to treat these diseases. Chronic Ang II elevation induces increased immune cell infiltration in the kidneys contributing to increase in intrarenal cytokine levels specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6). Notably, IL-6 is required for Ang II-induced AGT augmentation in renal proximal tubular cells (PTC). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions leading to AGT augmentation have not been delineated. Renal cortical AGT levels are lower in female rodents than in males under normal conditions; however, plasma and liver AGT levels do not exhibit this gender disparity, suggesting that kidneys have a unique mechanism inherent to establishing basal AGT levels. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) levels are higher in the kidneys of female rats than those of male rats and that HDAC9 inhibitions by siRNA and an inhibitor resulted in augmentation of AGT levels in PTC. These results indicate that HDAC9 is a suppressor of intrarenal AGT expression. Since HDACs suppress gene transcription by histone-deacetylation, changes in HDAC levels alter accessibility of activated transcription factors to their binding sites on gene promoters. The preliminary study showed that HDAC9 levels are decreased by Ang II in PTC. Accordingly, we hypothesize that downregulation of HDAC9 by Ang II reduces the suppressive effects of HDAC9 on AGT expression. This allows other transcription factors activated by pathological stimuli, in particula IL-6, to augment AGT expression, thus leading to the progression of hypertension and associated tissue injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. To address this hypothesis, we will establish that Ang II suppresses intrarenal HDAC9 levels during the development of Ang II-dependent hypertension using unique PTC and Ang II- dependent hypertensive animal models (Specific Aim 1). In addition, the proposed studies will demonstrate that Ang II-induced intrarenal HDAC9 downregulation is required for intrarenal AGT augmentation by synergistic effects of Ang II and IL-6 and consequent development of hypertension (Specific Aim 2). In these experiments, HDAC9 knockdown by siRNA and overexpression via AAV2 infection will be used to show that the HDAC9 knockdown and IL-6 synergistically augment AGT expression in PTC and that kidney-specific HDAC9 overexpression attenuates intrarenal AGT elevation facilitating consequent the development of kidney injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. Gender differences of intrarenal HDAC9 regulation and its contribution to AGT regulation in hypertension will also be investigated in the projects. The results will establish the cardinal rol of intrarenal HDAC9 in the regulation of intrarenal AGT in Ang II-dependent hypertension and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting HDAC9 to treat hypertension and RAS associated tissue injury. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Angiotensinogen (AGT) regulation in the kidney is a key contributor to the hypertensive process. The overall goal of this project is to show an enzyme, HDAC9, regulates AGT levels in the kidney during progression of hypertension using genetically modified cell and animal models. The outcomes are expected to provide a novel and more effective approach for curtailing the development of hypertension and kidney injury and may facilitate clinical efforts to drastically reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with hypertension.","Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension",9187452,R01DK107694,"['Aldosterone ', ' Renin-Substrate ', ' Proangiotensin ', ' Hypertensinogen ', ' Angiotensinogen ', ' inhibitor ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' HDAC ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Infection ', ' Interleukin-2 ', ' Thymocyte Stimulating Factor ', ' T-Cell Stimulating Factor ', ' T-Cell Growth Factor ', ' T cell growth factor ', ' Mitogenic Factor ', ' Lymphocyte Mitogenic Factor ', ' Interleukine II ', ' Interleukine 2 Precursor ', ' Interleukine 2 ', ' Interleukin II ', ' Interleukin 2 Precursor ', ' Interleukin 2 ', ' IL2 Protein ', ' IL-2 ', ' Epidermal Thymocyte Activating Factor ', ' Costimulator ', ' Co-Stimulator ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' male ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Renin ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Renin-Angiotensin System ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transfection ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Injury ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Stimulus ', ' Attenuated ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Tubular ', ' Infiltration ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' Histone Deacetylation ', ' nephrogenesis ', ' kidney development ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' in vivo ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Outcome ', ' genetically modified cells ', ' genetically engineered cells ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' public health relevance ', ' HDAC9 gene ', ' MITR protein ', ' MITR gene ', ' MEF2-Interacting Transcription Repressor Protein ', ' KIAA0744 ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9A ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9 ', ' Histone Deacetylase 7B ', ' HDAC9A ', ' HDAC9 ', ' HDAC7B ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender disparity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIDDK,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2017,270900,0.03783790743639386
"Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (PREP RRT) - Resubmission 01 ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (PREP RRT) Patient education prior to renal replacement therapy (RRT) leads to reduced central venous catheter use, improved access to self-care dialysis such as peritoneal dialysis, and increased access to transplantation. Each of these modalities has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of life for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). African Americans are less likely than their White counterparts to receive nephrology care prior to dialysis initiation. African Americans are also less likely to hav a fistula for dialysis, to select peritoneal dialysis, and to appear on the renal transplant waitlit. Hospitalization may represent a ""missed opportunity"" to provide RRT education and planning to help patients make informed choices about their care that align with their preferences. Many patients are hospitalized within three months of dialysis initiation. The hospital may also capture patients who are not otherwise well-linked to the medical system. In addition, culturally-tailoring of health education messages through patient narratives has been found to be an effective means of increasing knowledge and motivating behavior change in African American patients. Therefore, I aim to develop, implement, and evaluate a patient-centered referral and education program for RRT (PREP RRT) that incorporates in- person education with a video of culturally-tailored patient narratives for hospitalized African American patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. To effectively implement these goals, I will develop expertise in qualitative research, health education design and behavioral interventions through coursework and mentorship. I have assembled a mentorship and research committee with expertise in reducing health disparities, qualitative methods, hospital-based interventions, multi-media education interventions and chronic kidney disease. I also will complete coursework in the Departments of Health Studies, Sociology and at the University of Illinois School of Public Health related to Survey Research, Qualitative Analysis and Behavior Change Interventions. Through successful implementation of this project, we aim to reduce health disparities and to decrease morbidity, mortality and health care utilization in patients with ESRD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improved patient education prior to renal replacement therapy (RRT) leads to reduced central venous catheter use, improved access to self-care dialysis such as peritoneal dialysis, and increased access to transplant for patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Each of these modalities has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality and to improve quality of life. While these modalities are underused overall, African Americans are less likely to have a fistula for dialysis, to select peritoneal dialysis, and to appear on the renal transplant waitlist than their White counterparts. This proposal seeks to develop, implement and evaluate a novel patient- centered referral and education program for RRT (PREP RRT) that incorporates in-person education with a video of culturally-tailored patient narratives for hospitalized African American patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). The data from this proposal will be critical for the development of future R-01 studies to assess the cost-effectiveness and impact on clinical and public health outcomes of this approach to education and referral for patients with advanced CKD and ESRD.",Patient Referral and Education Program prior to Renal Replacement Therapy (PREP RRT) - Resubmission 01,9267457,K23DK103111,"['Affect ', ' Outpatient Care ', ' Ambulatory Care ', ' Arteriovenous Aneurysm ', ' Arteriovenous fistula ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Chicago ', ' Communication ', ' cost assessment ', ' assess cost ', ' Cost Analyses ', ' Cost Analysis ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Fistula ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health education ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Home Renal Dialysis ', ' Home Hemodialyses ', ' Home Hemodialysis ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Illinois ', ' Inpatients ', ' Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Peritoneal Dialysis ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Sociology ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Survival Rate ', ' transplant ', ' Transplantation ', ' Transportation ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Misinformation ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Catheters ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Glean ', ' Caring ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' uptake ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Venous ', ' Transplant Recipients ', ' transplant patient ', ' Multimedia ', ' Multimedium ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Modality ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' education planning ', ' biomedical referral center ', ' referral center ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' motivated behavior ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' public health relevance ', ' primary outcome ', ' common treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Theory of Change ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' minority-serving hospitals ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,K23,2017,190125,0.06495418981049142
"Low Birth Weight, Blood Pressure, and Kidney Disease Project Summary Low birth weight (LBW) is an important risk factor for hypertension, cardiovascular and kidney disease; however, the mechanisms by which an adverse fetal environment programs risk for adult disease are poorly understood. Because this risk factor is determined at the beginning of a person’s lifespan, a better understanding of developmental programming can provide insight that improves early disease prevention and intervention to drastically reduce the burden of disease in later adulthood. Novel findings in this area also have great potential to reduce health disparities, as African-Americans are disproportionately affected by LBW and other conditions linked to this risk factor including hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Placental insufficiency is the most common cause of LBW in the Western world, and the reduced uterine perfusion pressure (RUPP) animal model of preeclampsia mimics the same health effects seen in human offspring, including the sex differences in how programming influences cardio-renal disease. Evidence suggests that renal inflammation plays a mediatorial role in the link between hypertension and kidney damage. The objective of this project is to study the effects of chronic elevations in blood pressure on renal health in intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) offspring, and to elucidate the mechanisms by which changes during development lead to increased renal risk in later life in a sex-specific manner. This will be done by inducing a secondary insult of reduced renal mass by uni-nephrectomy in 18 month old IUGR offspring, and comparing physiological indicators of renal function as well as molecular and histological markers of tissue injury between control and IUGR males and females. Blood pressure-lowering and anti-inflammatory medications will also be used to determine whether early intervention can prevent this renal damage in response to an insult. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that intrauterine growth restriction programs a long-term increase in blood pressure in males that initiates a progressive accelerated age-related decline in renal function leading to an enhanced susceptibility to renal injury in growth-restricted rats. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that intrauterine growth restriction programs enhanced up-regulation of renal TNF-α and TGF-β1 in response to a secondary renal insult that contributes to enhanced susceptibility to renal injury in growth-restricted rats. Project Narrative Low birth weight is an important risk factor for hypertension, cardiovascular and renal disease, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Understanding how low birth weight increases the risk for hypertension and chronic kidney disease is important in developing early interventions and better therapeutics for these conditions. This research seeks to understand the role of inflammatory cytokines in linking high blood pressure and kidney damage, and how these effects differ between low birth weight males and females.","Low Birth Weight, Blood Pressure, and Kidney Disease",9557040,F30DK112718,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Fetal Growth Retardation ', ' prenatal growth disorder ', ' intrauterine growth restriction ', ' intra-uterine growth retardation ', ' intra-uterine growth restriction ', ' impaired fetal growth ', ' Intrauterine Growth Retardation ', ' IUGR ', ' Fetal Growth Restriction ', ' Glomerular Filtration Rate ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Neoplasms ', ' Renal Tumor ', ' Renal Neoplasms ', ' Kidney Tumor ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' male ', ' Mississippi ', ' Morbidity -

"Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three major academic centers propose to collaborate as a combined clinical-technology site. The 2 clinical centers, NYU School of Medicine and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, have a rich and long history of commitment to SLE and together currently treat ~1,000 SLE patients. They will jointly assemble a renal phenotype-driven patient cohort comprising diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium cohort will be leveraged to develop, standardize and validate advanced technologies to identify critical signaling pathways in tissues (renal and skin), cells and urine. Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium will enroll and follow approximately 300 patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The causes of this potentially fatal, heterogeneous, chronic, and systemic autoimmune disease are not well understood, but its incidence, prevalence and severity are known to be affected by race and ethnicity, as well as socioeconomic status. Our proposed studies will focus on identification of treatable targets specific to kidney injury, and in particular to assess whether similar targets can be identified in cells from the skin, blood or urine which may help to predict kidney disease less invasively and at an earlier stage; the goal is to begin treatment of kidney disease much earlier than is now possible, and ultimately preserve kidney function in patients with SLE.",Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium,9530391,UH2AR067689,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Antibodies ', '

"Renal Mechanisms in Blood Pressure Control OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this PPG is to understand the role of the kidney in the pathogenesis of hypertension, a major cause of global mortality and a primary modifiable risk factor for renal, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Approximately half of all hypertensive subjects demonstrate sodium-sensitivity of blood pressure, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Several important discoveries from the investigators of this program provide unique conceptual insight into the development of salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage and form the basis for this proposal. The integrated hypothesis of our program is that salt-induced hypertension proceeds in two phases. An initial, or primary, increase in blood pressure (BP) is followed by a more dramatic, secondary rise of BP that is dependent upon the initial increase in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and culminates in `malignant hypertension' and renal end-organ damage. This global hypothesis will be tested in three projects which are exploring previously unrecognized areas of importance in hypertension. One entirely new area of research, to be examined in Project 1, is focused around the mechanisms of action of mTOR pathways in salt- sensitive hypertension and the potential therapeutic use of mTOR inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat hypertension. Project 2 is testing the innovative hypothesis that alterations in cellular metabolism, specifically insufficiencies in fumarase-related metabolism in the kidney, contribute to hypertension by decreasing arginine regeneration and nitric oxide levels. Project 3 is based upon the unique observation made in the current PPG indicating that an initial elevation in renal perfusion pressure is necessary to mediate the infiltration of immune cells into the kidney which amplifies the disease process; the proposed experiments will elucidate the molecular transduction of this physical force. To facilitate this important work, the projects are supported by an administrative core (Core A), and two scientific cores, which have been specially designed to meet the needs of the program and facilitate an economy of resources. Core B will supply the unique genetic animal models which have been generated to address the particular hypotheses of the scientific projects. Core C will provide many of the unique scientific approaches that will be used in the projects. Together, the three integrated projects and three cores of this PPG will provide important new information and insight into the mechanisms of salt-sensitive hypertension in a collaborative research effort that will accelerate the acquisition of knowledge more effectively than a simple aggregate of research projects that have no interaction or thematic integration. OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE The work in this PPG is designed to understand the role of the kidney in development of hypertension, which is the leading identifiable cause of death worldwide and a major risk factor for a number of related cardiovascular and renal diseases in the US. This program will examine the role of three, previously unexamined mechanisms which lead to the development and maintenance of sodium-sensitive hypertension. Specifically, the studies address the complex interrelationship between factors important in regulation of sodium excretion, cell growth and proliferation, mechanisms regulating cellular metabolism, and the immune system in the development of hypertension. The scientific projects that address these unique concepts will be supported by scientific core facilities which provide unique animal models and experimental approaches and methodologies to aid in these studies.",Renal Mechanisms in Blood Pressure Control,9417462,P01HL116264,"['Pathogenesis ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Therapeutic Uses ', '

"Risk Clustering and Stratification in Genetically High-Risk Individuals Using Electronic Medical Records and Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a revised submission for a K23 award by Dr. Girish Nadkarni at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Nadkarni is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease. This project will try to improve risk prediction and stratification for kidney disease progression in minority populations at baseline high genetic risk due to Apolipoprotein1 (APOL1) variants. Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Girish Nadkarni's career development into an independent investigator in the field of leveraging biomarkers, genomics and “big data” approaches for renal research. Dr. Nadkarni's career goal is to accurately risk stratify patients for renal functional decline for future targeted enrolment into clinical trials evaluating novel interventions. To achieve these goals, Dr. Nadkarni has assembled a mentoring and advisory team led by a primary mentor, Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor and Director of Clinical Research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and a co-mentor Dr. Erwin Bottinger, Professor of Medicine and former Director of The Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine. His advisory team consists of Dr. Emilia Bagiella, Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at Mount Sinai and an expert in longitudinal analysis; Dr. Eimear Kenny, Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Genomics and an expert in statistical and population genetics; Dr. Avi Ma'ayan, an Associate Professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics and an expert in bioinformatics and Dr. Judy Cho, the incoming director of the Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine and an expert in translational genetics. His proposed training plan focuses on four areas (1) Advanced Statistical and Epidemiological Methodology; (2) Biomarker Methodology; (3) Computational Bioinformatics and Programming and (4) Focused mentorship and career development. Environment: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research and is one of the top 20 medical schools in NIH funding. ISMMS was also named as one of the ""The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies In Big Data"" due to its computing resources and the BioMe Biobank, whose primary architect is Dr.Bottinger and is currently led by Dr. Cho. Research: Ethnic minorities are at higher risk of both development and progression of chronic kidney disease. This has been linked in part to risk variants in the APOL1 gene that are present in up to 14% in populations of African descent (including African Americans [AAs] and Hispanic Latinos [HLas]) but are absent in non- Hispanic Whites. Although APOL1 high-risk genotype is, in general, associated with faster eGFR decline, only about 50% progress to ESRD and patients within this group have differing rates of renal functional decline. Thus, risk stratification within this group is poor, limiting early intervention. With a large proportion of vulnerable ethnic minorities at increased risk, innovative methods for predicting renal function decline within this genetically high-risk group are urgently needed. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) Establish associations of clinical predictors, lifestyle factors and laboratory parameters with longitudinal eGFR decline in AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; (2) To develop a novel plasma biomarker panel assessing inflammation, injury, vascular insult and fibrosis, for risk prognostication of longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; and (3) To conduct comprehensive, external validation of the highest performing plasma biomarkers and traditional predictors and derive risk clusters using validated predictors for longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLa's with APOL1 high-risk genotype. Aims 1 and 2 will be conducted using the largest cohort of participants with APOL1 risk variants ever assembled (n=809). Aim 3 will be conducted using four external cohorts, the Vanderbilt BioVU cohort, the Genetic testing to Understand and Address Renal Disease Disparities (GUARDD) study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC). These approaches integrating genetic, biomarker and electronic medical record clinical information, will form the basis for future work investigating targeted enrolment of high-risk patients in pragmatic, randomized controlled trials for early interventions, which will be proposed in an R01 application before the end of the K award period. PROJECT NARRATIVE APOL1 genetic variants have emerged as a key risk factor for renal disease risk in ethnic minorities. However, only a fraction of those who are APOL1 high-risk progress to renal failure. We plan to use commonly collected clinical information and novel plasma proteins to accurately identify subsets of patients within this genetically high-risk group for early identification and interventions and in the process, train Dr. Girish N. Nadkarni, to accelerate his progress towards being an independent clinical and translational investigator in the field of utilizing big data in nephrology.",Risk Clustering and Stratification in

"Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Augmented intrarenal angiotensinogen (AGT) is a critical contributor to the activation of intrarenal renin- angiotensin system (RAS) which leads to the development of hypertension and associated tissue injury. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms underlying AGT upregulation is essential for the development of strategies to treat these diseases. Chronic Ang II elevation induces increased immune cell infiltration in the kidneys contributing to increase in intrarenal cytokine levels specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6). Notably, IL-6 is required for Ang II-induced AGT augmentation in renal proximal tubular cells (PTC). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions leading to AGT augmentation have not been delineated. Renal cortical AGT levels are lower in female rodents than in males under normal conditions; however, plasma and liver AGT levels do not exhibit this gender disparity, suggesting that kidneys have a unique mechanism inherent to establishing basal AGT levels. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) levels are higher in the kidneys of female rats than those of male rats and that HDAC9 inhibitions by siRNA and an inhibitor resulted in augmentation of AGT levels in PTC. These results indicate that HDAC9 is a suppressor of intrarenal AGT expression. Since HDACs suppress gene transcription by histone-deacetylation, changes in HDAC levels alter accessibility of activated transcription factors to their binding sites on gene promoters. The preliminary study showed that HDAC9 levels are decreased by Ang II in PTC. Accordingly, we hypothesize that downregulation of HDAC9 by Ang II reduces the suppressive effects of HDAC9 on AGT expression. This allows other transcription factors activated by pathological stimuli, in particula IL-6, to augment AGT expression, thus leading to the progression of hypertension and associated tissue injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. To address this hypothesis, we will establish that Ang II suppresses intrarenal HDAC9 levels during the development of Ang II-dependent hypertension using unique PTC and Ang II- dependent hypertensive animal models (Specific Aim 1). In addition, the proposed studies will demonstrate that Ang II-induced intrarenal HDAC9 downregulation is required for intrarenal AGT augmentation by synergistic effects of Ang II and IL-6 and consequent development of hypertension (Specific Aim 2). In these experiments, HDAC9 knockdown by siRNA and overexpression via AAV2 infection will be used to show that the HDAC9 knockdown and IL-6 synergistically augment AGT expression in PTC and that kidney-specific HDAC9 overexpression attenuates intrarenal AGT elevation facilitating consequent the development of kidney injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. Gender differences of intrarenal HDAC9 regulation and its contribution to AGT regulation in hypertension will also be investigated in the projects. The results will establish the cardinal rol of intrarenal HDAC9 in the regulation of intrarenal AGT in Ang II-dependent hypertension and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting HDAC9 to treat hypertension and RAS associated tissue injury. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Angiotensinogen (AGT) regulation in the kidney is a key contributor to the hypertensive process. The overall goal of this project is to show an enzyme, HDAC9, regulates AGT levels in the kidney during progression of hypertension using genetically modified cell and animal models. The outcomes are expected to provide a novel and more effective approach for curtailing the development of hypertension and kidney injury and may facilitate clinical efforts to drastically reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with hypertension.","Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension",9399644,R01DK107694,"['Aldosterone ', ' Angiotensinogen ', ' Renin-Substrate ', ' Proangiotensin ', ' Hypertensinogen ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' HDAC ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Infection ', ' Interleukin-2 ', ' Thymocyte Stimulating Factor ', ' T-Cell Stimulating Factor ', ' T-Cell Growth Factor ', ' T cell growth factor ', ' Mitogenic Factor ', ' Lymphocyte Mitogenic Factor ', ' Interleukine II ', ' Interleukine 2 Precursor ', ' Interleukine 2 ', ' Interleukin II ', ' Interleukin 2 Precursor ', ' Interleukin 2 ', ' IL2 Protein ', ' IL-2 ', ' Epidermal Thymocyte Activating Factor ', ' Costimulator ', ' Co-Stimulator ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' male ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Renin ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Renin-Angiotensin System ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Transfection ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' Injury ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Stimulus ', ' Attenuated ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Tubular ', ' Infiltration ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' Histone Deacetylation ', ' nephrogenesis ', ' kidney development ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' in vivo ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Outcome ', ' genetically engineered cells ', ' genetically modified cells ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' overexpress ', ' over-expression ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' MITR protein ', ' MITR gene ', ' MEF2-Interacting Transcription Repressor Protein ', ' KIAA0744 ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9A ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9 ', ' Histone Deacetylase 7B ', ' HDAC9A ', ' HDAC9 ', ' HDAC7B ', ' HDAC9 gene ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' gender disparity ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NIDDK,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2018,270900,0.03783790743639386
"Patient-centered Approach To Improving Dialysis Adherence in African Americans Dr. Ebele Umeukeje is a Nephrologist and a Health Services Researcher in the Nephrology Division at Vanderbilt University. Her long-term career goal is to become a successful Independent Physician Scientist with expertise in kidney disease disparities research focused on improving clinical outcomes in vulnerable kidney disease patients. She is specifically interested in reducing the excessive hospitalization and re- hospitalization in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) by intervening upon dialysis treatment non-adherence. Her short-term career goals, with support from this K23, are to gain 1) advanced skills in the development of novel culturally sensitive, multi-level strategies to eliminate disparities by enhancing patient engagement in self-care and 2) practical experience in patient-centered adherence and disparities research, including the responsible conduct of research. Excessive hospitalization and re-hospitalization in ESRD has significant  Excessive hospitalization and re-hospitalization in ESRD has significant public health relevance to patients, providers and health systems due to its costs both financially and to patients' morbidity and mortality, and emerging evidence shows dialysis treatment adherence is an important modifiable contributor. Compared to whites, African American ESRD patients have a four-fold higher ESRD prevalence, an unacceptably high re- hospitalization rate and higher rates of dialysis treatment non-adherence. The goals of this proposal are to 1) identify novel patient and provider-level determinants of dialysis treatment non-adherence; 2) develop culturally sensitive interventions to improve dialysis treatment adherence; and 3) provide the expert mentorship and experience necessary to facilitate Dr. Umeukeje's successful transition to an independent Physician Scientist with expertise in improving adherence, reducing disparities and optimizing outcomes in ESRD.",Patient-centered Approach To Improving Dialysis Adherence in African Americans,9521230,K23DK114566,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Influentials ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Publishing ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Self Determination ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Urea ', ' Ureaphil ', ' Urea Carbamide ', ' Elaqua XX ', ' Carbamide ', ' World Health Organization ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' Funding ', ' Patient Noncompliance ', ' Patient Nonadherence ', ' Patient Non-Adherence ', ' Patient Non Compliance ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Self Care outcome ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' cultural competence ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' motivational interview ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' cost ', ' Dialysis patients ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' trial comparing ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment adherence ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' racial minority ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Prospective cohort ', ' patient engagement ', ' hospitalization rates ', ' ']",NIDDK,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,K23,2018,186258,0.059013717822736664
"Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Robust systems to consent, screen, return results, and to evaluate processes and outcomes of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for common chronic diseases are missing and urgently needed. We propose that hypertension-associated CKD in African ancestry communities has emerged as a highly relevant and well-suited opportunity for a 'prototype' genomic medicine demonstration project that addresses common chronic illnesses managed in primary care settings. African ancestry populations with hypertension (HTN) have 2- to 3-fold higher risk of developing CKD, and a 5-fold increased risk to progress to end stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared with whites. Recent discoveries demonstrate that testable alleles of the APOL1 locus on chromosome 22 have a major effect on and explain almost all of the excess risk for hypertension-associated CKD and its progression to ESRD in African ancestry populations. In this genomic medicine demonstration pilot project, we plan to implement a cluster randomized trial at primary care facilities of a network of community health centers in Harlem and the Bronx and at Mount Sinai Medical Center. The trial will test whether the desperately low probabilities of correct renal care i.e. appropriate ordering of tests to evaluate CKD and CKD progression, appropriate prescription of renoprotective renin angiotensin blockade, appropriate control of blood pressure in hypertensive patients with albuminuria of African ancestry, will be improved significantly in those facilities that receive EMR-enabled renal care CDS incorporating APOL1 genomic risk information compared with those facilities that receive renal care CDS based on conventional risk information only.  The project will have three Specific Aims: 1) Understand knowledge, attitudes, beliefs about testing for APOL1, returning results, and engaging people of African ancestry and their clinicians into a process of testing, counseling and appropriate clinical care. 2) Develop systems and evidence-based advice messages to enable point of care Clinical Decision Support (CDS) for primary care providers advising renal care practice guidelines with our without genomic APOL1 risk information. 3) Conduct a cluster randomized trial assigning eight distinct primary care facilities to receive either renal care CDS with APOL1 genomic risk information (GENOMIC RENAL CARE FACILITY) or with conventional risk information (CONVENTIONAL RENAL CARE FACILITY) to guide primary care for non-diabetic African Americans with hypertension. In the long-term, the proposed genomic medicine demonstration pilot project is expected to generate essential new insights for sustainable adoption and large-scale dissemination of genomic medicine in diverse clinical settings providing care for common adult-onset diseases in general, and for underserved African Ancestry populations with large excess burden of non-diabetic kidney diseases specifically. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We will conduct a randomized trial in a network of community health centers and primary care facilities to study the effects and challenges of incorporating genomic risk information in clinical care for patients of African ancestry with hypertension that are at risk for or have chronic kidney disease. The study will provide information whether patients at primary care facilities where genomic risk information for kidney disease is shared between providers and patients, and patients have different outcomes than patients in facilities where genomic risk information is not shared. This pilot project will create new insights on how genomic medicine approaches will be adopted and whether they can make a difference to improve primary care for hypertensive kidney disease in underserved minorities.",Genomic Medicine Pilot For Hypertension And Kidney Disease In Primary Care,9654805,U01HG007278,"['Renin ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Caring ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' insight ', ' African ', ' Disease Progression ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Community Health Networks ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Medical center ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' regulate blood pressure ', ' regulate BP ', ' blood pressure management ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP regulation ', ' BP management ', ' BP homeostasis ', ' BP control ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Genomics ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Institution ', ' genome sequencing ', ' Address ', ' Consent ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' modifiable risk ', ' nondiabetic ', ' non-diabetic ', ' prototype ', ' tumor ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' end stage disease ', ' exomes ', ' exome ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' clinical risk ', ' screening ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' underserved minority ', ' APOL1 ', ' APOL-I ', ' APOL1 gene ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' clinical decision support ', ' clinical implementation ', ' Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Albuminuria ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Angiotensins ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22 ', ' Chromosome 22 ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Counseling ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Family ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health care facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Renal Hypertension ', ' hypertensive kidney ', ' Hypertensive Nephropathy ', ' Institutes ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' New York City ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Probability ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' ']",NHGRI,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,U01,2018,338980,0.05762007202718525
"Predicting and Reducing Future Health Disparities for U.S. Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Disparities in diabetes and its complications have persisted, despite increased public health focus on reducing them. Compared to whites living with diabetes, blacks have a two-fold increased risk of stroke, amputation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD); Hispanics and Asians have a 20 to 50% higher risk for eye problems, and at least an 80% higher risk of ESRD. Many interventions have been developed to reduce diabetes health disparities; however, despite accumulated evidence, adoption of interventions to eliminate disparities has been slow across healthcare organizations and payers. A critical barrier to developing and adopting policies to eliminate diabetes health disparities is the lack of long-term data on the economic and clinical impact of these interventions. Simulation models are mathematical representations of the complex relationships between predictors (e.g., hemoglobin A1c) and outcomes (e.g., ESRD) among specific populations. Diabetes simulation models have been used for over a decade to describe the cost-effectiveness of clinical guidelines, clinical interventions, and new drugs and devices. However, they have been rarely used to study the disparate impact between populations, i.e. health disparities. Without such a model, it is difficult to compare the relative value of different clinical and public health interventions to reduce health disparities and difficult for policymakers to decide where to allocate resources. The reason that such a model does not exist is that the majority of current diabetes simulation models rely on data from the UKPDS and other sources, which did not have large populations of Hispanic and/or Asian patients. The major challenge to developing a more useful multi-ethnic diabetes simulation model is the need to have comprehensive data across all domains of healthcare utilization, including clinically-measured risk factors (e.g., blood pressure and laboratory results) and race/ethnicity data. We will use data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a multi-ethnic, socioeconomically diverse population with diabetes (n~192,000) (16% Latino, 11% African American, 7% South Asian, 4% Chinese; 13% difficulty with English) to develop a mathematical model of the relationships between patient risk factors and outcomes using Kaiser data, and then to input national data and published data into the model in order to forecast the long-term implications of efforts to reduce diabetes health disparities. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a simulation model of diabetes outcomes for white, African American, Latino, South Asian, and Chinese populations; 2) forecast the impact of past changes in risk factor control on future diabetes health disparities; and 3) determine the cost-effectiveness of diabetes health disparities interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eliminating diabetes health disparities has been a national goal since 2000, but disparities in diabetes quality of care and outcomes still persist. In order to reduce diabetes health disparities, one essential tool that is not available is an accurate model for predicting future health disparities. We aim to develop a multi-ethnic simulation model of diabetes outcomes and to use this model to forecast the long-term implications of efforts to reduce diabetes health disparities.",Predicting and Reducing Future Health Disparities for U.S. Adults with Diabetes,9624565,R01MD013420,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lipids ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Veterans ', ' Woman ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' tool ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' English Language ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' deprivation ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' South Asian ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health intervention ', ' Patient risk ', ' study population ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2018,415465,0.048399428556200996
"'Crashing' onto Dialysis: Diagnosis Experiences, Coping Styles, and Treatment Decision-Making Preferences of Patients with Unexpected End-Stage Renal Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 15% of the adult U.S. population is affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD), with more than 700,000 in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD has devastating health, quality of life, and economic consequences, rendering most afflicted patients unable to work and costing Medicare $33.9 billion in 2015. The ESRD population comprises some of the most vulnerable members of society, with minority and low- resource groups disproportionately affected. Arguably, the most disadvantaged group is the subset of patients that receive a sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis with no prior planning or nephrological care, which currently accounts for 36% of the total ESRD population. This population suffers increased morbidity and mortality and has limited access to kidney transplantation. Further, the subset of patients that received no or an unknown length of pre-ESRD nephrological care is more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities (40.5% of African American and 42.7% of Hispanic incident patients as compared to 35.1% of Caucasians), compounding existing racial and ethnic disparities within the ESRD population. To date, there has been no U.S.-based examination of the ESRD diagnosis experiences, coping styles and strategies, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) decision-making preferences of patients experiencing this life changing diagnosis under such uniquely traumatic circumstances. Therefore, we propose a study that will compare the ESRD diagnosis experiences, coping styles and strategies, and RRT decision-making preferences of patients who had sudden, unexpected ESRD diagnosis and who were unknown to nephrology, to patients who had expected ESRD diagnosis as part of ongoing nephrological care (Aim 1). We will also assess nephrologists' current practices and perspectives on the manner and timing of RRT education for patients with sudden, unexpected ESRD diagnosis (Aim 2). This multi-methods study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the diagnosis experiences, coping styles and strategies, and RRT decision-making preferences of patients facing sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis. The proposed study will contribute important knowledge about patients who have sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis and the results of this research will inform clinical practice and the direct care of thousands of patients experiencing sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis. Finally, the collected data will serve as the preliminary work needed to inform the development of a RRT decision support tool. The tool will be validated and tested, using a randomized controlled design, to determine its impact on RRT decisions and steps toward kidney transplantation among patients with sudden, unexpected ESRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high prevalence and high costs of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have deleterious effects on afflicted individuals and the whole of society. Increasing our understanding of some of the most disadvantaged patients with ESRD, such as those who experience sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis, has the potential to inform future intervention research that can improve clinical practice and remediate existing racial and ethnic health disparities for all patients with ESRD.","'Crashing' onto Dialysis: Diagnosis Experiences, Coping Styles, and Treatment Decision-Making Preferences of Patients with Unexpected End-Stage Renal Disease",9611946,F31DK117539,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Climacteric ', ' life change ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Insurance ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Learning ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Caring ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Disease Costs ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' news ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' acute stress ', ' case control ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' shared decision making ', ' trial design ', ' support tools ', ' training opportunity ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subsets ', ' ']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2018,41663,0.09826827144574704
"Development of biomarkers for improved classification of membranous lupus nephritis SUMMARY/ABSTRACT African Americans are disproportionately affected by chronic and end stage kidney disease: while 35% of patients on dialysis are African American, only 13.2% of the U.S. population is African American. One factor contributing to this disparity is the high incidence of autoimmune disease, especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), present in the African American population. Lupus nephritis is a common complication of SLE that leads to end stage renal disease (ESRD) in 5.4% of affected individuals. African Americans and Hispanics are known to have worse outcomes with lupus nephritis compared to Caucasians. The incidence of reduced GFR or other renal disease in African Americans is 38% compared to 19% in Caucasians with SLE [1]. The current classification scheme of lupus nephritis, put forth as a joint effort between the International Society of Nephrology and the Renal Pathology Society (ISN/RPS) recognizes 6 subclasses, based entirely on morphological criteria, ranging from minimal (Class I) to advanced sclerosing kidney disease (Class VI) [2]. However, this classification system is markedly deficient in that it poorly predicts outcomes, especially in identifying those patients with early disease at greatest risk for progressing to ESRD. What is needed is an improved classification system based on the pathophysiology of the disease process. Such a classification is expected to better predict outcomes and would therefore be more useful in guiding therapy of patients with lupus nephritis. The two major types of lupus nephritis (LN) associated with progression to ESRD are proliferative LN (Classes III and IV) and membranous LN (Class V), all of which are driven by immune complexes that accumulate in the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium. Patients with membranous LN are especially problematic to manage, as they may remain quiescent or actively progress to ESRD, and the current classification system offers no guidance into which patients will progress, nor how best to manage this challenging patient population. Arkana plans to develop an improved classification system for membranous LN based on the antigenic composition of the immune complexes present in glomeruli. At the conclusion of Phase I, we expect to have defined a proteomic profile of autoantigens and complement factors that drive membranous LN. In addition, we will correlate these drivers of autoimmunity with those present in other forms of membranous glomerulopathy, including PLA2R- and THSD7A-associated membranous glomerulopathy. In the Phase II, we will begin to determine outcomes in patients with different subclasses of membranous LN, and we will also develop antibodies against these autoantigens into serological, immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence assays that can be deployed in diagnostic assays. In the Phase III, we will commercialize these assays and continue to study outcomes and response to therapy in the post-market setting. PROJECT NARRATIVE Lupus nephritis is a disease that is markedly over-represented in minority populations, leading in many cases to end-stage renal disease, with associated significant morbidity and mortality. The current classification system for lupus nephritis poorly predicts which patients will progress to end-stage renal disease, as well as which therapeutic interventions are most likely to be efficacious. In this Phase I application, we will identify antigenic proteins and other inflammatory factors present in immune complexes in the kidneys of patients with membranous lupus nephritis. Such information is likely to lead to improved understanding of the mechanism of renal injury in patients with different types of membranous lupus nephritis. In turn, these results will guide the development of improved classification systems and diagnostic assays that can inform clinicians of which patients need more aggressive immunosuppressive therapy.",Development of biomarkers for improved classification of membranous lupus nephritis,9796488,R43MD014110,"['Affect ', ' Antibodies ', ' Antigen-Antibody Complex ', ' Immune Complex ', ' Antigens ', ' immunogen ', ' ATGN ', ' Archives ', ' Arteries ', ' Autoantibodies ', ' self reactive antibody ', ' autoimmune antibody ', ' Autoantigens ', ' Self-Antigens ', ' Autologous Antigens ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' Autoimmunity ', ' Autoimmune Status ', ' Basement membrane ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Western Blotting ', ' protein blotting ', ' Western Immunoblotting ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' Complication ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Membranous Nephropathy ', ' Membranous Glomerulopathy ', ' Membranous Glomerulonephropathy ', ' Extramembranous Glomerulopathy ', ' Membranous Glomerulonephritis ', ' Goals ', ' IgG ', ' 7S Gamma Globulin ', ' Immunoglobulin G ', ' immunosuppression therapy ', ' artificial immunosuppression ', ' Immunosuppressive Therapy ', ' Antirejection Therapy ', ' Anti-Rejection Therapy ', ' Therapeutic immunosuppression ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Lupus Glomerulonephritis ', ' Lupus Nephritis ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peptides ', ' Proteins ', ' Risk ', ' Societies ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Staining method ', ' Stains ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Immunofluorescence ', ' Immunofluorescence Immunologic ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Residual state ', ' Residual ', ' Phase ', ' Serological ', ' Serologic ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Tubular ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' programs ', ' Notification ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Reaction ', ' System ', ' Glomerular capsule structure ', ' Malpighian Capsule ', "" Bowman's Capsule "", ' Outcome Study ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Physical shape ', ' morphological signature ', ' morphological criteria ', ' morphologic signature ', ' morphologic criteria ', ' Morphologic Finding ', ' Proteome ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' response ', ' Proteomics ', ' laser capture microdissection ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Tissue Sample ', ' Incubated ', ' Detection ', ' International ', ' Renal Tissue ', ' Subgroup ', ' Classification Scheme ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' post-market ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' patient population ', ' novel marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' new marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' candidate validation ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' phase 2 study ', ' phase II study ', ' diagnostic assay ', ' biomarker development ', ' outcome prediction ', ' predictors of outcomes ', ' predictive outcomes ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEPHROPATHOLOGY ASSOCIATES,R43,2019,281247,0.10370053184685377
"Risk Clustering and Stratification in Genetically High-Risk Individuals Using Electronic Medical Records and Biomarkers PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This is a revised submission for a K23 award by Dr. Girish Nadkarni at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Dr. Nadkarni is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient oriented clinical research of chronic kidney disease. This project will try to improve risk prediction and stratification for kidney disease progression in minority populations at baseline high genetic risk due to Apolipoprotein1 (APOL1) variants. Candidate: The primary objective of this application is to support Dr. Girish Nadkarni's career development into an independent investigator in the field of leveraging biomarkers, genomics and “big data” approaches for renal research. Dr. Nadkarni's career goal is to accurately risk stratify patients for renal functional decline for future targeted enrolment into clinical trials evaluating novel interventions. To achieve these goals, Dr. Nadkarni has assembled a mentoring and advisory team led by a primary mentor, Dr. Steven Coca, Associate Professor and Director of Clinical Research at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and a co-mentor Dr. Erwin Bottinger, Professor of Medicine and former Director of The Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine. His advisory team consists of Dr. Emilia Bagiella, Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at Mount Sinai and an expert in longitudinal analysis; Dr. Eimear Kenny, Assistant Professor in the Department of Genetics and Genomics and an expert in statistical and population genetics; Dr. Avi Ma'ayan, an Associate Professor in the Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics and an expert in bioinformatics and Dr. Judy Cho, the incoming director of the Charles Bronfman Institute of Personalized Medicine and an expert in translational genetics. His proposed training plan focuses on four areas (1) Advanced Statistical and Epidemiological Methodology; (2) Biomarker Methodology; (3) Computational Bioinformatics and Programming and (4) Focused mentorship and career development. Environment: Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai is a national leader in research and is one of the top 20 medical schools in NIH funding. ISMMS was also named as one of the ""The World's Top 10 Most Innovative Companies In Big Data"" due to its computing resources and the BioMe Biobank, whose primary architect is Dr.Bottinger and is currently led by Dr. Cho. Research: Ethnic minorities are at higher risk of both development and progression of chronic kidney disease. This has been linked in part to risk variants in the APOL1 gene that are present in up to 14% in populations of African descent (including African Americans [AAs] and Hispanic Latinos [HLas]) but are absent in non- Hispanic Whites. Although APOL1 high-risk genotype is, in general, associated with faster eGFR decline, only about 50% progress to ESRD and patients within this group have differing rates of renal functional decline. Thus, risk stratification within this group is poor, limiting early intervention. With a large proportion of vulnerable ethnic minorities at increased risk, innovative methods for predicting renal function decline within this genetically high-risk group are urgently needed. Therefore, our specific aims are: (1) Establish associations of clinical predictors, lifestyle factors and laboratory parameters with longitudinal eGFR decline in AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; (2) To develop a novel plasma biomarker panel assessing inflammation, injury, vascular insult and fibrosis, for risk prognostication of longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLas with APOL1 high-risk genotype; and (3) To conduct comprehensive, external validation of the highest performing plasma biomarkers and traditional predictors and derive risk clusters using validated predictors for longitudinal eGFR decline in self-reported AA/HLa's with APOL1 high-risk genotype. Aims 1 and 2 will be conducted using the largest cohort of participants with APOL1 risk variants ever assembled (n=809). Aim 3 will be conducted using four external cohorts, the Vanderbilt BioVU cohort, the Genetic testing to Understand and Address Renal Disease Disparities (GUARDD) study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC). These approaches integrating genetic, biomarker and electronic medical record clinical information, will form the basis for future work investigating targeted enrolment of high-risk patients in pragmatic, randomized controlled trials for early interventions, which will be proposed in an R01 application before the end of the K award period. PROJECT NARRATIVE APOL1 genetic variants have emerged as a key risk factor for renal disease risk in ethnic minorities. However, only a fraction of those who are APOL1 high-risk progress to renal failure. We plan to use commonly collected clinical information and novel plasma proteins to accurately identify subsets of patients within this genetically high-risk group for early identification and interventions and in the process, train Dr. Girish N. Nadkarni, to accelerate his progress towards being an independent clinical and translational investigator in the field of utilizing big data in nephrology.",Risk Clustering and Stratification in

"Conference on Control of Renal Function in Health and Disease PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The purpose of this proposal is to seek support for a travel award program for the American Physiological Society (APS) conference entitled Control of Renal Function in Health and Disease scheduled for June 23rd-29th, 2019 in Charlottesville, VA. Interest in the control of renal function and renal hemodynamics has grown considerably over the past couple decades as the incidences of hypertension and kidney injury in the U.S. have ballooned. Thus, there is great need in the scientific community for meetings focused on the mechanisms underlying the control of renal hemodynamics and hypertensive kidney injury. The overall goal of the 2019 Control of Renal Function in Health and Disease conference is to bring together basic scientists and clinician scientists to discuss new ideas about renal and cardiovascular function and the mechanisms underlying kidney injury. As such, the conference objectives are to: 1) gather a critical mass of expert basic and clinical researchers with interests in the mechanisms underlying renal and cardiovascular disease and renal hemodynamics to promote the exchange of ideas, develop scientific relationships, and to promote potential future collaborations; 2) present largely unpublished data so that the ""current state of the art"" is communicated; and, 3) promote the interest of early career investigators and trainees in developing new studies into the roles of novel signaling mechanisms, inflammation, hypertension, sex disparities, circadian influences and related issues that contribute to renal and renal vascular dysfunction. In order to achieve the conference objectives above, the organizing committee has developed a meeting program that focuses on novel areas of renal function and disease including symposia on the following topics: obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome; sex steroids and the kidney; developmental programming of kidney disease; genetics, epigenetics and the kidney; and immunology and the kidney and circadian biology of kidney function. Symposia will also cover recent advances in the traditional areas of renal hemodynamics, acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease and podocytes, autacoids and the kidney, and hypertension and the kidney. In order to promote the interest of trainees and early career investigators in the field and their participation in the conference, we propose to administer an NIH-funded travel award program for trainees and early career investigators.

"Predicting and Reducing Future Health Disparities for U.S. Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Disparities in diabetes and its complications have persisted, despite increased public health focus on reducing them. Compared to whites living with diabetes, blacks have a two-fold increased risk of stroke, amputation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD); Hispanics and Asians have a 20 to 50% higher risk for eye problems, and at least an 80% higher risk of ESRD. Many interventions have been developed to reduce diabetes health disparities; however, despite accumulated evidence, adoption of interventions to eliminate disparities has been slow across healthcare organizations and payers. A critical barrier to developing and adopting policies to eliminate diabetes health disparities is the lack of long-term data on the economic and clinical impact of these interventions. Simulation models are mathematical representations of the complex relationships between predictors (e.g., hemoglobin A1c) and outcomes (e.g., ESRD) among specific populations. Diabetes simulation models have been used for over a decade to describe the cost-effectiveness of clinical guidelines, clinical interventions, and new drugs and devices. However, they have been rarely used to study the disparate impact between populations, i.e. health disparities. Without such a model, it is difficult to compare the relative value of different clinical and public health interventions to reduce health disparities and difficult for policymakers to decide where to allocate resources. The reason that such a model does not exist is that the majority of current diabetes simulation models rely on data from the UKPDS and other sources, which did not have large populations of Hispanic and/or Asian patients. The major challenge to developing a more useful multi-ethnic diabetes simulation model is the need to have comprehensive data across all domains of healthcare utilization, including clinically-measured risk factors (e.g., blood pressure and laboratory results) and race/ethnicity data. We will use data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a multi-ethnic, socioeconomically diverse population with diabetes (n~192,000) (16% Latino, 11% African American, 7% South Asian, 4% Chinese; 13% difficulty with English) to develop a mathematical model of the relationships between patient risk factors and outcomes using Kaiser data, and then to input national data and published data into the model in order to forecast the long-term implications of efforts to reduce diabetes health disparities. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a simulation model of diabetes outcomes for white, African American, Latino, South Asian, and Chinese populations; 2) forecast the impact of past changes in risk factor control on future diabetes health disparities; and 3) determine the cost-effectiveness of diabetes health disparities interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eliminating diabetes health disparities has been a national goal since 2000, but disparities in diabetes quality of care and outcomes still persist. In order to reduce diabetes health disparities, one essential tool that is not available is an accurate model for predicting future health disparities. We aim to develop a multi-ethnic simulation model of diabetes outcomes and to use this model to forecast the long-term implications of efforts to reduce diabetes health disparities.",Predicting and Reducing Future Health Disparities for U.S. Adults with Diabetes,9788527,R01MD013420,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' virtual simulation ', ' in silico ', ' computerized simulation ', ' computerized modeling ', ' computer based models ', ' computational simulation ', ' computational models ', ' computational modeling ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' Computerized Models ', ' Computer based Simulation ', ' Computer Models ', ' Computer Simulation ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lipids ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Veterans ', ' Woman ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Individual ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Integrated Delivery of Health Care ', ' integrated delivery of healthcare ', ' tool ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' English Language ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' health care service organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' health care organization ', ' models and simulation ', ' model-based simulation ', ' Devices ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' deprivation ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematic model ', ' Math Models ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' South Asian ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' predictive modeling ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health intervention ', ' Patient risk ', ' study population ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' stroke risk ', ' risk of stroke ', ' risk for stroke ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2019,401785,0.048399428556200996
"Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Augmented intrarenal angiotensinogen (AGT) is a critical contributor to the activation of intrarenal renin- angiotensin system (RAS) which leads to the development of hypertension and associated tissue injury. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms underlying AGT upregulation is essential for the development of strategies to treat these diseases. Chronic Ang II elevation induces increased immune cell infiltration in the kidneys contributing to increase in intrarenal cytokine levels specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6). Notably, IL-6 is required for Ang II-induced AGT augmentation in renal proximal tubular cells (PTC). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions leading to AGT augmentation have not been delineated. Renal cortical AGT levels are lower in female rodents than in males under normal conditions; however, plasma and liver AGT levels do not exhibit this gender disparity, suggesting that kidneys have a unique mechanism inherent to establishing basal AGT levels. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) levels are higher in the kidneys of female rats than those of male rats and that HDAC9 inhibitions by siRNA and an inhibitor resulted in augmentation of AGT levels in PTC. These results indicate that HDAC9 is a suppressor of intrarenal AGT expression. Since HDACs suppress gene transcription by histone-deacetylation, changes in HDAC levels alter accessibility of activated transcription factors to their binding sites on gene promoters. The preliminary study showed that HDAC9 levels are decreased by Ang II in PTC. Accordingly, we hypothesize that downregulation of HDAC9 by Ang II reduces the suppressive effects of HDAC9 on AGT expression. This allows other transcription factors activated by pathological stimuli, in particula IL-6, to augment AGT expression, thus leading to the progression of hypertension and associated tissue injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. To address this hypothesis, we will establish that Ang II suppresses intrarenal HDAC9 levels during the development of Ang II-dependent hypertension using unique PTC and Ang II- dependent hypertensive animal models (Specific Aim 1). In addition, the proposed studies will demonstrate that Ang II-induced intrarenal HDAC9 downregulation is required for intrarenal AGT augmentation by synergistic effects of Ang II and IL-6 and consequent development of hypertension (Specific Aim 2). In these experiments, HDAC9 knockdown by siRNA and overexpression via AAV2 infection will be used to show that the HDAC9 knockdown and IL-6 synergistically augment AGT expression in PTC and that kidney-specific HDAC9 overexpression attenuates intrarenal AGT elevation facilitating consequent the development of kidney injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. Gender differences of intrarenal HDAC9 regulation and its contribution to AGT regulation in hypertension will also be investigated in the projects. The results will establish the cardinal rol of intrarenal HDAC9 in the regulation of intrarenal AGT in Ang II-dependent hypertension and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting HDAC9 to treat hypertension and RAS associated tissue injury. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Angiotensinogen (AGT) regulation in the kidney is a key contributor to the hypertensive process. The overall goal of this project is to show an enzyme, HDAC9, regulates AGT levels in the kidney during progression of hypertension using genetically modified cell and animal models. The outcomes are expected to provide a novel and more effective approach for curtailing the development of hypertension and kidney injury and may facilitate clinical efforts to drastically reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with hypertension.","Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension",9609450,R01DK107694,"['Aldosterone ', ' Angiotensinogen ', ' Renin-Substrate ', ' Proangiotensin ', ' Hypertensinogen ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Combining Site ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' HDAC ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Infection ', ' T-Cell Growth Factor ', ' T cell growth factor ', ' Mitogenic Factor ', ' Lymphocyte Mitogenic Factor ', ' Interleukine II ', ' Interleukine 2 Precursor ', ' Interleukine 2 ', ' Interleukin II ', ' Interleukin 2 Precursor ', ' Interleukin 2 ', ' IL2 Protein ', ' IL-2 ', ' Epidermal Thymocyte Activating Factor ', ' Costimulator ', ' Co-Stimulator ', ' Thymocyte Stimulating Factor ', ' T-Cell Stimulating Factor ', ' Interleukin-2 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' male ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rattus ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Renin ', ' Renin-Angiotensin System ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodent ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Specificity ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' transcription factor ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transfection ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' Injury ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' KO mice ', ' Stimulus ', ' Attenuated ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Tubular ', ' Infiltration ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' treatment duration ', ' treatment days ', ' Treatment Period ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' Histone Deacetylation ', ' kidney development ', ' nephrogenesis ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' in vivo ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' knock-down ', ' knockdown ', ' Outcome ', ' genetically modified cells ', ' genetically engineered cells ', ' Cell model ', ' Cellular model ', ' overexpression ', ' overexpress ', ' public health relevance ', ' HDAC9 gene ', ' MITR protein ', ' MITR gene ', ' MEF2-Interacting Transcription Repressor Protein ', ' KIAA0744 ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9A ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9 ', ' Histone Deacetylase 7B ', ' HDAC9A ', ' HDAC9 ', ' HDAC7B ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender disparity ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIDDK,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2019,270900,0.03783790743639386
"Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three major academic centers propose to collaborate as a combined clinical-technology site. The 2 clinical centers, NYU School of Medicine and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, have a rich and long history of commitment to SLE and together currently treat ~1,000 SLE patients. They will jointly assemble a renal phenotype-driven patient cohort comprising diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium cohort will be leveraged to develop, standardize and validate advanced technologies to identify critical signaling pathways in tissues (renal and skin), cells and urine. Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium will enroll and follow approximately 300 patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The causes of this potentially fatal, heterogeneous, chronic, and systemic autoimmune disease are not well understood, but its incidence, prevalence and severity are known to be affected by race and ethnicity, as well as socioeconomic status. Our proposed studies will focus on identification of treatable targets specific to kidney injury, and in particular to assess whether similar targets can be identified in cells from the skin, blood or urine which may help to predict kidney disease less invasively and at an earlier stage; the goal is to begin treatment of kidney disease much earlier than is now possible, and ultimately preserve kidney function in patients with SLE.",Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium,9913037,UH2AR067689,"['Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Dermal ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Renal function ', ' kidney function ', ' insight ', ' Patient Recruitments ', ' participant recruitment ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Recurrent disease ', ' Relapsed Disease ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Leucocytic infiltrate ', ' Cellular Infiltrate ', ' Liquid substance ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Normal tissue morphology ', ' Normal Tissue ', ' Deposition ', ' Deposit ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' interest ', ' kidney cell ', ' Renal Cell ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' interstitial ', ' kidney preservation ', ' cohort ', ' Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell ', ' PBMC ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Structure ', ' validation studies ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Gene Expression Profiling ', ' transcriptional profiling ', ' gene expression assay ', ' gene expression analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analysis ', ' Transcript Expression Analyses ', ' Gene Expression Pattern Analysis ', ' Gene Expression Monitoring ', ' Code ', ' Coding System ', ' Early identification ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' RNA analysis ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-translated RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Skin ', ' Capillary Endothelial Cell ', ' Small RNA ', ' Address ', ' Copy Number Polymorphism ', ' copy number variation ', ' copy number variant ', ' Molecular Analysis ', ' Renal Tissue ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Flare ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Validation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Gene Expression Profile ', ' transcriptional signature ', ' gene expression signature ', ' gene expression pattern ', ' Expression Signature ', ' deep sequencing ', ' Lupus ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new drugs ', ' new drug treatments ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' therapeutic development ', ' therapeutic agent development ', ' public health relevance ', ' patient population ', ' systemic autoimmune disease ', ' systemic autoimmune disorder ', ' candidate identification ', ' biobank ', ' biorepository ', ' transcriptome sequencing ', ' RNAseq ', ' RNA sequencing ', ' RNA Seq ', ' Drug Targeting ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' transcriptome ', ' global transcription profile ', ' global gene expression ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' kidney biopsy ', ' renal biopsy ', ' Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Antibodies ', ' Archives ', ' Biopsy ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Complementary DNA ', ' cDNA ', ' cell sorting ', ' Cell Separation Technology ', ' Cell Segregation ', ' Cell Isolation ', ' Cell Separation ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Future ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Goals ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Histones ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"'Crashing' onto Dialysis: Diagnosis Experiences, Coping Styles, and Treatment Decision-Making Preferences of Patients with Unexpected End-Stage Renal Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 15% of the adult U.S. population is affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD), with more than 700,000 in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). ESRD has devastating health, quality of life, and economic consequences, rendering most afflicted patients unable to work and costing Medicare $33.9 billion in 2015. The ESRD population comprises some of the most vulnerable members of society, with minority and low- resource groups disproportionately affected. Arguably, the most disadvantaged group is the subset of patients that receive a sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis with no prior planning or nephrological care, which currently accounts for 36% of the total ESRD population. This population suffers increased morbidity and mortality and has limited access to kidney transplantation. Further, the subset of patients that received no or an unknown length of pre-ESRD nephrological care is more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities (40.5% of African American and 42.7% of Hispanic incident patients as compared to 35.1% of Caucasians), compounding existing racial and ethnic disparities within the ESRD population. To date, there has been no U.S.-based examination of the ESRD diagnosis experiences, coping styles and strategies, and renal replacement therapy (RRT) decision-making preferences of patients experiencing this life changing diagnosis under such uniquely traumatic circumstances. Therefore, we propose a study that will compare the ESRD diagnosis experiences, coping styles and strategies, and RRT decision-making preferences of patients who had sudden, unexpected ESRD diagnosis and who were unknown to nephrology, to patients who had expected ESRD diagnosis as part of ongoing nephrological care (Aim 1). We will also assess nephrologists' current practices and perspectives on the manner and timing of RRT education for patients with sudden, unexpected ESRD diagnosis (Aim 2). This multi-methods study will provide a comprehensive understanding of the diagnosis experiences, coping styles and strategies, and RRT decision-making preferences of patients facing sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis. The proposed study will contribute important knowledge about patients who have sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis and the results of this research will inform clinical practice and the direct care of thousands of patients experiencing sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis. Finally, the collected data will serve as the preliminary work needed to inform the development of a RRT decision support tool. The tool will be validated and tested, using a randomized controlled design, to determine its impact on RRT decisions and steps toward kidney transplantation among patients with sudden, unexpected ESRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE The high prevalence and high costs of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have deleterious effects on afflicted individuals and the whole of society. Increasing our understanding of some of the most disadvantaged patients with ESRD, such as those who experience sudden and unexpected ESRD diagnosis, has the potential to inform future intervention research that can improve clinical practice and remediate existing racial and ethnic health disparities for all patients with ESRD.","'Crashing' onto Dialysis: Diagnosis Experiences, Coping Styles, and Treatment Decision-Making Preferences of Patients with Unexpected End-Stage Renal Disease",9747668,F31DK117539,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' life change ', ' Climacteric ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dialysis ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Insurance ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Interview ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' kidney tx ', ' Renal Transplants ', ' Renal Transplantation ', ' Kidney Transplants ', ' Kidney Grafting ', ' Kidney Transplantation ', ' Learning ', ' Life Experience ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nephrology ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' Privatization ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Savings ', ' Societies ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Caring ', ' Cost of Illness ', ' Sickness Cost ', ' Disease Costs ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Renal Replacement Therapy ', ' Kidney Replacement Therapy ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' news ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' tool ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' member ', ' acute stress ', ' case control ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' ESRD ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Monitor ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' post-doctoral training ', ' postdoctoral training ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' clinical practice ', ' disease diagnosis ', ' shared decision making ', ' trial design ', ' support tools ', ' training opportunity ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' ethnic health disparity ', ' patient subsets ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subgroups ', ' ']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,F31,2019,39136,0.09826827144574704
"Renal Mechanisms in Blood Pressure Control OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this PPG is to understand the role of the kidney in the pathogenesis of hypertension, a major cause of global mortality and a primary modifiable risk factor for renal, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Approximately half of all hypertensive subjects demonstrate sodium-sensitivity of blood pressure, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Several important discoveries from the investigators of this program provide unique conceptual insight into the development of salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage and form the basis for this proposal. The integrated hypothesis of our program is that salt-induced hypertension proceeds in two phases. An initial, or primary, increase in blood pressure (BP) is followed by a more dramatic, secondary rise of BP that is dependent upon the initial increase in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and culminates in `malignant hypertension' and renal end-organ damage. This global hypothesis will be tested in three projects which are exploring previously unrecognized areas of importance in hypertension. One entirely new area of research, to be examined in Project 1, is focused around the mechanisms of action of mTOR pathways in salt- sensitive hypertension and the potential therapeutic use of mTOR inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat hypertension. Project 2 is testing the innovative hypothesis that alterations in cellular metabolism, specifically insufficiencies in fumarase-related metabolism in the kidney, contribute to hypertension by decreasing arginine regeneration and nitric oxide levels. Project 3 is based upon the unique observation made in the current PPG indicating that an initial elevation in renal perfusion pressure is necessary to mediate the infiltration of immune cells into the kidney which amplifies the disease process; the proposed experiments will elucidate the molecular transduction of this physical force. To facilitate this important work, the projects are supported by an administrative core (Core A), and two scientific cores, which have been specially designed to meet the needs of the program and facilitate an economy of resources. Core B will supply the unique genetic animal models which have been generated to address the particular hypotheses of the scientific projects. Core C will provide many of the unique scientific approaches that will be used in the projects. Together, the three integrated projects and three cores of this PPG will provide important new information and insight into the mechanisms of salt-sensitive hypertension in a collaborative research effort that will accelerate the acquisition of knowledge more effectively than a simple aggregate of research projects that have no interaction or thematic integration. OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE The work in this PPG is designed to understand the role of the kidney in development of hypertension, which is the leading identifiable cause of death worldwide and a major risk factor for a number of related cardiovascular and renal diseases in the US. This program will examine the role of three, previously unexamined mechanisms which lead to the development and maintenance of sodium-sensitive hypertension. Specifically, the studies address the complex interrelationship between factors important in regulation of sodium excretion, cell growth and proliferation, mechanisms regulating cellular metabolism, and the immune system in the development of hypertension. The scientific projects that address these unique concepts will be supported by scientific core facilities which provide unique animal models and experimental approaches and methodologies to aid in these studies.",Renal Mechanisms in Blood Pressure Control,9619345,P01HL116264,"['Aldosterone ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular

"Renal Mechanisms in Blood Pressure Control OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this PPG is to understand the role of the kidney in the pathogenesis of hypertension, a major cause of global mortality and a primary modifiable risk factor for renal, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Approximately half of all hypertensive subjects demonstrate sodium-sensitivity of blood pressure, the mechanisms of which are poorly understood. Several important discoveries from the investigators of this program provide unique conceptual insight into the development of salt-sensitive hypertension and renal damage and form the basis for this proposal. The integrated hypothesis of our program is that salt-induced hypertension proceeds in two phases. An initial, or primary, increase in blood pressure (BP) is followed by a more dramatic, secondary rise of BP that is dependent upon the initial increase in renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and culminates in `malignant hypertension' and renal end-organ damage. This global hypothesis will be tested in three projects which are exploring previously unrecognized areas of importance in hypertension. One entirely new area of research, to be examined in Project 1, is focused around the mechanisms of action of mTOR pathways in salt- sensitive hypertension and the potential therapeutic use of mTOR inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy to treat hypertension. Project 2 is testing the innovative hypothesis that alterations in cellular metabolism, specifically insufficiencies in fumarase-related metabolism in the kidney, contribute to hypertension by decreasing arginine regeneration and nitric oxide levels. Project 3 is based upon the unique observation made in the current PPG indicating that an initial elevation in renal perfusion pressure is necessary to mediate the infiltration of immune cells into the kidney which amplifies the disease process; the proposed experiments will elucidate the molecular transduction of this physical force. To facilitate this important work, the projects are supported by an administrative core (Core A), and two scientific cores, which have been specially designed to meet the needs of the program and facilitate an economy of resources. Core B will supply the unique genetic animal models which have been generated to address the particular hypotheses of the scientific projects. Core C will provide many of the unique scientific approaches that will be used in the projects. Together, the three integrated projects and three cores of this PPG will provide important new information and insight into the mechanisms of salt-sensitive hypertension in a collaborative research effort that will accelerate the acquisition of knowledge more effectively than a simple aggregate of research projects that have no interaction or thematic integration. OVERALL PROJECT NARRATIVE The work in this PPG is designed to understand the role of the kidney in development of hypertension, which is the leading identifiable cause of death worldwide and a major risk factor for a number of related cardiovascular and renal diseases in the US. This program will examine the role of three, previously unexamined mechanisms which lead to the development and maintenance of sodium-sensitive hypertension. Specifically, the studies address the complex interrelationship between factors important in regulation of sodium excretion, cell growth and proliferation, mechanisms regulating cellular metabolism, and the immune system in the development of hypertension. The scientific projects that address these unique concepts will be supported by scientific core facilities which provide unique animal models and experimental approaches and methodologies to aid in these studies.",Renal Mechanisms in Blood Pressure Control,9841969,P01HL116264,"['Aldosterone ', ' Arginine ', ' L-Arginine ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular

"Investigation of the bidirectional relationship between kidney cancer treatment and dementia We have long known that real-world black-white racial disparities have existed in the treatment and outcomes of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, it is unclear how these disparities will change with the recent introduction and widespread adoption of oral anticancer agents (OAAs). As with any advance in medical technology, the introduction of these agents has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes, but also has the potential to exacerbate current disparities if these advances in OAAs are not equally available or do not provide the same benefit to all patients. The proposed study addresses this critical gap in our knowledge by investigating a mix of nationally representative, yet diverse populations of patients with kidney cancer in the United States. Unfortunately, no single dataset of patients with kidney cancer exists that is able to capture nationally-representative data on patients of all ages and all insurance status within the United States. However, by using three complementary data sources we are able to include patients of all ages, insurance, geography, and race to investigate the current and future utilization, outcomes, and costs associated with emerging OAAs in patients with kidney cancer. Aim 1 – Investigate patient-level disparities in OAA use in RCC patients Aim 2 – Investigate provider- and system-level disparities in OAA use in RCC patients.. Aim 3 – Investigate the impact of patient-provider networks (PPNs) on OAA adoption and identify pockets of late or non-adopting providers. The proposed research will (1) assess and describe the current state of oral anticancer medication utilization, delivery, and adherence; (2) identify patient, provider, structural, and systemic barriers to adherence and disparities in outcomes; and (3) develop models and strategies to improve safe and effective delivery of these agents in order to improve access to optimal clinical care and outcomes. . We have long known that real-world black-white racial disparities have existed in the treatment and outcomes of patients with renal cell carcinoma.

"Mississippi Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Research Program Mississippi is among the leaders in mortality due to heart disease, stroke, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and kidney disease. Mississippi also has the greatest health care disparities in the country along with limited extramural research support necessary to recruit and retain top biomedical researchers that can address these important issues. These widening health care disparities affect underrepresented minorities, including African Americans and Hispanic Americans, who are disproportionately affected by heart disease, stroke, diabetes, nephritis/nephrosis, hypertension and hypertension related renal diseases. Therefore, a unique opportunity exists in Mississippi for building diverse research infrastructure to investigate mechanisms and new treatment options for cardiovascular and renal diseases at the very location where they are most prominent in the United States. This application proposes to continue a highly successful summer research program in the State of Mississippi that increased the participation of individuals from underrepresented minorities (URM) in hypertension, renal and cardiovascular related biomedical fields over the last five years. The Mississippi Diversity in Hypertension and Cardiorenal Research Program (MSDHCR) supported over forty URM students in the first funding cycle, with greater than 90% of graduates utilizing their science degree in graduate school, professional school, or in their employment. The University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) has a long history of excellence in cardiovascular and renal research, and mentoring. The current proposal seeks an additional five years for the MSDHCR program, and represents a critical component of the mission to train and mentor cardiovascular and renal researchers. This competitive renewal includes enhanced institutional support and innovative improvements that ensure the continued development of a robust biomedical pipeline. The overall objective of this training program is to provide career and education mentoring along with state-of the art cardiovascular and renal research training experiences to individuals with disadvantaged and underrepresented ethnic or racial backgrounds in the cardiovascular and renal sciences. Undergraduate students from disadvantaged and underrepresented backgrounds will participate in this program that has the following aims: 1. To provide program participants a multi-disciplinary training and mentoring experience in cardiovascular and renal research. 2. To provide program participants with opportunities for professional development that will help them achieve careers in health-related research professions. 3. To provide standardized test training for program participants that will prepare them for the next steps in their educational training. Mississippi is among the leaders in health disparities in cardiovascular diseases that disproportionately affect individuals from disadvantaged and underrepresented racial and ethnic populations. At the same time, Mississippi lags in the development of a robust pipeline of biomedical researchers that can address these important issues.

"Informal Advance Care Planning with Family in Blacks with End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis Project Summary Chronic kidney disease affects 15% of the population in the United States, resulting in greater than 30 million people affected and over half of this population requires treatment with hemodialysis to replace the function of the renal system. The mortality rate at one and three years after hemodialysis initiation is 16% and 43%, respectively. Additionally, Blacks are 2.9 times more likely to be diagnosed with end stage renal disease (ESRD) when compared to Whites. Due to this racial disparity and associated mortality in ESRD, advance care planning (ACP) is of extreme importance for this population because of its association with high quality care at the end of life. Formal ACP is defined as a written advance directive that states preferences for care or treatment near the end-of-life and/or a written document that designates a surrogate decision maker should one become incapacitated called a healthcare power of attorney. The prevalence of ACP has been primarily assessed by written advance directives, and Blacks are more likely to engage in informal ACP with family, that is discussions without the associated written documents. Therefore, Blacks are largely underrepresented in ACP research. If more were known about the factors associated with informal ACP in Blacks, interventions could be developed to enhance the content and rate of Informal ACP in Blacks with ESRD on hemodialysis. Guided by a conceptual framework that illustrates the multiple factors that impact ACP in Blacks, a sequential explanatory mixed methods study design will be used to examine and explore the relationships between personal, interpersonal, and structural factors and the engagement of family in informal ACP among Blacks with ESRD on hemodialysis. The following specific aims are proposed Aim 1: To examine the relationships between personal factors (illness perception, expectations of end stage renal disease and hemodialysis treatment), interpersonal factors (religiosity, spirituality, and social support), and structural factors (health literacy and trust in healthcare) and whether Blacks with ESRD on hemodialysis engage family in informal ACP. Aim 2:To explore the context of informal ACP with family among Blacks with ESRD on hemodialysis. Aim 3: To comprehensively describe how factors identified in aims 1 and 2 impact informal ACP with family among Blacks with ESRD on hemodialysis. The proposed study is in alignment with the strategic plan of the National Institute of Nursing Research, to understand healthcare decision making across the lifespan for those with advanced illness and those suffering from disparities in health. The results of this study will contribute new knowledge on informal ACP with family in Blacks with ESRD on hemodialysis, leading to the development of culturally sensitive measures of informal ACP and the development of future interventions to increase the rate and content of informal ACP with family. Project Narrative Advance care planning is associated with high quality of care at the end-of-life and persons with renal failure on hemodialysis have a 16% chance of dying with in 1 year and 43% in 3 years. Blacks are approximately three times as likely to have renal failure when compared to Whites. The proposed study will explore and describe multiple factors and their association with informal advance care planning with family among Blacks with end stage renal disease on hemodialysis.",Informal Advance Care Planning with Family in Blacks with End Stage Renal Disease on Hemodialysis,9991340,F31NR019211,"['Adoption ', ' Advance Directives ', ' advanced directive ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Baltimore ', ' Bereavement ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Communities ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Decision Making ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Hemodialysis ', ' Hemodialyses ', ' Chronic Kidney Failure ', ' Chronic Renal Disease ', ' Chronic Renal Failure ', ' chronic kidney disease ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Marriage ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Patients ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Kidney Failure ', ' Kidney Insufficiency ', ' Renal Failure ', ' Renal Insufficiency ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Friends ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Distress ', ' kidney function ', ' Renal function ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Measurement ', ' Knowledge ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Health Care Power of Attorney ', ' Healthcare Power of Attorney ', ' preference ', ' Advance Health Care Planning ', ' Advance Healthcare Planning ', ' Advance Care Planning ', ' Structure ', ' expectation ', ' advanced illness ', ' advanced disease ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' end-of-life ', ' end of life ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' health literacy ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' care preference ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' illness perceptions ', ' end of life decision making ', ' end-of-life decision making ', ' surrogate decision maker ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NINR,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F31,2020,45520,0.13983699767522773
"Disparities in the Use of Oral Anticancer Agents in Kidney Cancer We have long known that real-world black-white racial disparities have existed in the treatment and outcomes of patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, it is unclear how these disparities will change with the recent introduction and widespread adoption of oral anticancer agents (OAAs). As with any advance in medical technology, the introduction of these agents has the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes, but also has the potential to exacerbate current disparities if these advances in OAAs are not equally available or do not provide the same benefit to all patients. The proposed study addresses this critical gap in our knowledge by investigating a mix of nationally representative, yet diverse populations of patients with kidney cancer in the United States. Unfortunately, no single dataset of patients with kidney cancer exists that is able to capture nationally-representative data on patients of all ages and all insurance status within the United States. However, by using three complementary data sources we are able to include patients of all ages, insurance, geography, and race to investigate the current and future utilization, outcomes, and costs associated with emerging OAAs in patients with kidney cancer. Aim 1 – Investigate patient-level disparities in OAA use in RCC patients Aim 2 – Investigate provider- and system-level disparities in OAA use in RCC patients.. Aim 3 – Investigate the impact of patient-provider networks (PPNs) on OAA adoption and identify pockets of late or non-adopting providers. The proposed research will (1) assess and describe the current state of oral anticancer medication utilization, delivery, and adherence; (2) identify patient, provider, structural, and systemic barriers to adherence and disparities in outcomes; and (3) develop models and strategies to improve safe and effective delivery of these agents in order to improve access to optimal clinical care and outcomes. . We have long known that real-world black-white racial disparities have existed in the treatment and outcomes of patients with renal cell carcinoma. However, it is unclear how these disparities will change with the recent introduction and widespread adoption of oral anticancer agents (OAAs), which have the potential to either widen or narrow current disparities. The proposed study addresses this critical gap in our knowledge by using three complementary data sources to capture both nationally representative, yet diverse populations to include patients of all ages, insurance, geography, and race to study modifiable barriers to optimal OAA utilization and adherence a the level of patients, providers, facilities, and region.",Disparities in the Use of Oral Anticancer Agents in Kidney Cancer,9840890,R01CA226842,"['Knowledge ', ' Insurance Status ', ' Insurance Coverage ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Oral ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' metropolitan ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Genitourinary Cancers ', ' Urogenital Cancer ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Kidney Cancer ', ' Kidney Carcinoma ', ' Renal Cancer ', ' Renal carcinoma ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Emergent Technologies ', ' Emerging Technologies ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' sex ', ' years of life lost ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' peer influence ', ' clinical care ', ' patient population ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' population health ', ' system architecture ', ' network architecture ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' improved outcome ', ' data resource ', ' provider networks ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' anticancer ', ' anti-cancer ', ' Adoption ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Medical Association ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anticancer drug ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Renal Cell Carcinoma ', ' Grawitz Tumor ', ' Hypernephroid Carcinoma ', ' Hypernephroma ', ' Nephroid Carcinoma ', ' Renal Adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Cell Adenocarcinoma ', ' Renal Cell Cancer ', ' kidney adenocarcinoma ', ' Censuses ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Sources ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hospital Referrals ', ' Hospitals ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Insurance ', ' Locales ', ' North Carolina ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Privatization ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Registries ', ' Research ', ' Technology ', ' Medical Technology ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' United States ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Rural ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Intravenous ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,367546,0.006896731663081688
"Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Augmented intrarenal angiotensinogen (AGT) is a critical contributor to the activation of intrarenal renin- angiotensin system (RAS) which leads to the development of hypertension and associated tissue injury. Therefore, elucidating mechanisms underlying AGT upregulation is essential for the development of strategies to treat these diseases. Chronic Ang II elevation induces increased immune cell infiltration in the kidneys contributing to increase in intrarenal cytokine levels specifically interleukin 6 (IL-6). Notably, IL-6 is required for Ang II-induced AGT augmentation in renal proximal tubular cells (PTC). However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these complex interactions leading to AGT augmentation have not been delineated. Renal cortical AGT levels are lower in female rodents than in males under normal conditions; however, plasma and liver AGT levels do not exhibit this gender disparity, suggesting that kidneys have a unique mechanism inherent to establishing basal AGT levels. Our preliminary studies demonstrated that histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) levels are higher in the kidneys of female rats than those of male rats and that HDAC9 inhibitions by siRNA and an inhibitor resulted in augmentation of AGT levels in PTC. These results indicate that HDAC9 is a suppressor of intrarenal AGT expression. Since HDACs suppress gene transcription by histone-deacetylation, changes in HDAC levels alter accessibility of activated transcription factors to their binding sites on gene promoters. The preliminary study showed that HDAC9 levels are decreased by Ang II in PTC. Accordingly, we hypothesize that downregulation of HDAC9 by Ang II reduces the suppressive effects of HDAC9 on AGT expression. This allows other transcription factors activated by pathological stimuli, in particula IL-6, to augment AGT expression, thus leading to the progression of hypertension and associated tissue injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. To address this hypothesis, we will establish that Ang II suppresses intrarenal HDAC9 levels during the development of Ang II-dependent hypertension using unique PTC and Ang II- dependent hypertensive animal models (Specific Aim 1). In addition, the proposed studies will demonstrate that Ang II-induced intrarenal HDAC9 downregulation is required for intrarenal AGT augmentation by synergistic effects of Ang II and IL-6 and consequent development of hypertension (Specific Aim 2). In these experiments, HDAC9 knockdown by siRNA and overexpression via AAV2 infection will be used to show that the HDAC9 knockdown and IL-6 synergistically augment AGT expression in PTC and that kidney-specific HDAC9 overexpression attenuates intrarenal AGT elevation facilitating consequent the development of kidney injury in Ang II-dependent hypertension. Gender differences of intrarenal HDAC9 regulation and its contribution to AGT regulation in hypertension will also be investigated in the projects. The results will establish the cardinal rol of intrarenal HDAC9 in the regulation of intrarenal AGT in Ang II-dependent hypertension and provide a mechanistic rationale for targeting HDAC9 to treat hypertension and RAS associated tissue injury. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Angiotensinogen (AGT) regulation in the kidney is a key contributor to the hypertensive process. The overall goal of this project is to show an enzyme, HDAC9, regulates AGT levels in the kidney during progression of hypertension using genetically modified cell and animal models. The outcomes are expected to provide a novel and more effective approach for curtailing the development of hypertension and kidney injury and may facilitate clinical efforts to drastically reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with hypertension.","Histone deacetylase 9 is an epigenetic suppressor of intrarenal angiotensinogen, serving as a key mechanism in angiotensinogen augmentation in hypertension",9830053,R01DK107694,"['Aldosterone ', ' Angiotensinogen ', ' Hypertensinogen ', ' Proangiotensin ', ' Renin-Substrate ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Binding Sites ', ' Combining Site ', ' Reactive Site ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Enzymes ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Female ', ' Genes ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Histone Deacetylase ', ' HDAC ', ' HDAC Proteins ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Infection ', ' Interleukin-2 ', ' Co-Stimulator ', ' Costimulator ', ' Epidermal Thymocyte Activating Factor ', ' IL-2 ', ' IL2 Protein ', ' Interleukin 2 ', ' Interleukin 2 Precursor ', ' Interleukin II ', ' Interleukine 2 ', ' Interleukine 2 Precursor ', ' Interleukine II ', ' Lymphocyte Mitogenic Factor ', ' Mitogenic Factor ', ' T cell growth factor ', ' T-Cell Growth Factor ', ' T-Cell Stimulating Factor ', ' Thymocyte Stimulating Factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Kidney ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' renal ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic body system ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' male ', ' Transgenic Mice ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mus ', ' Mice ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Murine ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Renin ', ' Angiotensin-Forming Enzyme ', ' Angiotensinogenase ', ' Renin-Angiotensin System ', ' Rodent ', ' Rodentia ', ' Rodents Mammals ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Specificity ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' transcription factor ', ' Basal Transcription Factor ', ' Basal transcription factor genes ', ' General Transcription Factor Gene ', ' General Transcription Factors ', ' Transcription Factor Proto-Oncogene ', ' Transcription factor genes ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Transfection ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' kidney injury ', ' renal injury ', ' Injury to Kidney ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' KO mice ', ' Knock-out Mice ', ' Null Mouse ', ' Knockout Mice ', ' Stimulus ', ' Attenuated ', ' Tubular ', ' Tubular formation ', ' Infiltration ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Treatment Period ', ' treatment days ', ' treatment duration ', ' cell type ', ' System ', ' extracellular ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' model of animal ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Model ', ' novel ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' Short interfering RNA ', ' siRNA ', ' Small Interfering RNA ', ' Histone Deacetylation ', ' kidney development ', ' nephrogenesis ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' in vivo ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Pathologic ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' knockdown ', ' knock-down ', ' Outcome ', ' genetically engineered cells ', ' genetically modified cells ', ' Cellular model ', ' Cell model ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' public health relevance ', ' HDAC7B ', ' HDAC9 ', ' HDAC9A ', ' Histone Deacetylase 7B ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9 ', ' Histone Deacetylase 9A ', ' KIAA0744 ', ' MEF2-Interacting Transcription Repressor Protein ', ' MITR gene ', ' MITR protein ', ' HDAC9 gene ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' gender disparity ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' injury to tissue ', ' tissue injury ', ' ']",NIDDK,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2020,270900,0.03783790743639386
"Predicting and Reducing Future Health Disparities for U.S. Adults with Diabetes PROJECT SUMMARY Disparities in diabetes and its complications have persisted, despite increased public health focus on reducing them. Compared to whites living with diabetes, blacks have a two-fold increased risk of stroke, amputation, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD); Hispanics and Asians have a 20 to 50% higher risk for eye problems, and at least an 80% higher risk of ESRD. Many interventions have been developed to reduce diabetes health disparities; however, despite accumulated evidence, adoption of interventions to eliminate disparities has been slow across healthcare organizations and payers. A critical barrier to developing and adopting policies to eliminate diabetes health disparities is the lack of long-term data on the economic and clinical impact of these interventions. Simulation models are mathematical representations of the complex relationships between predictors (e.g., hemoglobin A1c) and outcomes (e.g., ESRD) among specific populations. Diabetes simulation models have been used for over a decade to describe the cost-effectiveness of clinical guidelines, clinical interventions, and new drugs and devices. However, they have been rarely used to study the disparate impact between populations, i.e. health disparities. Without such a model, it is difficult to compare the relative value of different clinical and public health interventions to reduce health disparities and difficult for policymakers to decide where to allocate resources. The reason that such a model does not exist is that the majority of current diabetes simulation models rely on data from the UKPDS and other sources, which did not have large populations of Hispanic and/or Asian patients. The major challenge to developing a more useful multi-ethnic diabetes simulation model is the need to have comprehensive data across all domains of healthcare utilization, including clinically-measured risk factors (e.g., blood pressure and laboratory results) and race/ethnicity data. We will use data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a multi-ethnic, socioeconomically diverse population with diabetes (n~192,000) (16% Latino, 11% African American, 7% South Asian, 4% Chinese; 13% difficulty with English) to develop a mathematical model of the relationships between patient risk factors and outcomes using Kaiser data, and then to input national data and published data into the model in order to forecast the long-term implications of efforts to reduce diabetes health disparities. Our specific aims are to 1) develop a simulation model of diabetes outcomes for white, African American, Latino, South Asian, and Chinese populations; 2) forecast the impact of past changes in risk factor control on future diabetes health disparities; and 3) determine the cost-effectiveness of diabetes health disparities interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE Eliminating diabetes health disparities has been a national goal since 2000, but disparities in diabetes quality of care and outcomes still persist. In order to reduce diabetes health disparities, one essential tool that is not available is an accurate model for predicting future health disparities. We aim to develop a multi-ethnic simulation model of diabetes outcomes and to use this model to forecast the long-term implications of efforts to reduce diabetes health disparities.",Predicting and Reducing Future Health Disparities for U.S. Adults with Diabetes,9912648,R01MD013420,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Amputation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Complication ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Sources ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lipids ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' United Kingdom ', ' Veterans ', ' Woman ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Guidelines ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Policies ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' integrated delivery of healthcare ', ' Integrated Delivery of Health Care ', ' tool ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' English Language ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' model-based simulation ', ' models and simulation ', ' Devices ', ' Modeling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' deprivation ', ' Math Models ', ' mathematic model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' mathematical model ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' ESRD ', ' End-Stage Kidney Disease ', ' End-Stage Renal Disease ', ' End stage renal failure ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' South Asian ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' modifiable risk ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' public health intervention ', ' Patient risk ', ' study population ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' risk for stroke ', ' risk of stroke ', ' stroke risk ', ' Mathematical Models and Simulations ', ' Mathematical Model Simulation ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' data diversity ', ' diverse data ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R01,2020,402615,0.048399428556200996
"Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three major academic centers propose to collaborate as a combined clinical-technology site. The 2 clinical centers, NYU School of Medicine and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, have a rich and long history of commitment to SLE and together currently treat ~1,000 SLE patients. They will jointly assemble a renal phenotype-driven patient cohort comprising diverse ethnic/racial backgrounds. The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium cohort will be leveraged to develop, standardize and validate advanced technologies to identify critical signaling pathways in tissues (renal and skin), cells and urine. Given the widespread vasculopathy characteristic of SLE, endothelial cell activation in the tubulointerstitium in lupus nephritis (LN) may be accompanied by similar activation, even in nonlesional skin. Molecular analysis of gene expression and signaling in specific subsets of renal cells may precede and predict the pathologic processes that lead to end organ damage and provide insights to deconstruct the heterogeneity of lupus in general and the histologic class of renal disease in particular. Furthermore, the faithful reflection of a relevant pathway in renal tissue by a more readily accessible tissue or fluid compartment would pave the way to early identification and treatment, critical to renal survival. Because SLE is strongly associated with racial/ethnic disparities, studies need to address whether specific biological pathways and drug targets are race-/ethnicity- dependent. Accordingly, METRO will comprise substantial numbers of Black, Hispanic, Asian, and White patients recruited at NYU (PI Buyon) and Einstein (PI Putterman). PI Dr. Thomas Tuschl at The Rockefeller University brings expertise and extensive experience in coding and non-coding RNAseq analysis and RNA diagnostic and therapeutic development. The proposal addresses 2 objectives: i) identification of candidate targets to guide novel therapy; and ii) development of non-invasive strategies to maximize early detection of LN. The former will be approached by identifying unique patterns from single-cell RNAseq (including RNA deregulation or mutation/allelic variation) in LN kidney cells (including capillary endothelial cells) compared with normal tissue/cells, and the latter by similar RNA analysis in LN matched with nonlesional skin, PBMC, and urine cellular pellet (UCP). Operationally the project is approached in sequential phases: Aim 1 (Phase 0, UH2): To establish the optimal method of renal tissue collection and single cell isolation of resident and infiltrating cells followed by poyA RNAseq, and similar application to cell populations present in nonlesional skin, PBMC, and UCP. Aim 2 (Phase I, UH2): To identify RNAseq patterns associated with different biopsy classes and compare with nonlesional skin (endothelial cells), PBMC, and UCP from the same patient. Aim 3 (Phase II, UH3): To establish whether a) the renal tissue RNAseq pattern associates with biopsy class, activity, and chronicity segregated by race/ethnicity; b) renal pattern tracks response to therapy and/or progression of renal disease in new onset or recurrent disease; and c) the pattern in skin, PBMC or UCP antedates new or relapsing kidney involvement. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium will enroll and follow approximately 300 patients who have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The causes of this potentially fatal, heterogeneous, chronic, and systemic autoimmune disease are not well understood, but its incidence, prevalence and severity are known to be affected by race and ethnicity, as well as socioeconomic status. Our proposed studies will focus on identification of treatable targets specific to kidney injury, and in particular to assess whether similar targets can be identified in cells from the skin, blood or urine which may help to predict kidney disease less invasively and at an earlier stage; the goal is to begin treatment of kidney disease much earlier than is now possible, and ultimately preserve kidney function in patients with SLE.",Multi-Ethnic Translational Research Optimization (METRO) Lupus Consortium,10200981,UH2AR067689,"['Affect ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Antibodies ', '
