"OVARIAN HORMONES, STRESS, AND IMMUNOLOGIC RESPONSIVENESS There is considerable evidence that stress can affect the immune system of animals. While similar data exist for men, less attention has been given to women. Perhaps one reason for this disparity is the potential complicating factor of ovarian hormones. Hormonal fluctuations associated with the menstrual cycle, pregnancy or menopause may modify the impact of stress on immune function and contribute to gender differences in immunologically-related disorders. Our first grant, for which this is a revised renewal, directly studies the relationship between hormonal state and the effects of psychological stress on the immune system of women. Using a unique A-B-A design, naturally cycling women are assessed for stress-induced changes in cardiovascular, endocrine and immunologic measures during the follicular stage and again, after complete pharmacologic suppression of ovarian hormones, produced by the GnRH agonist, Lupron. The contribution of estrogen is determined by comparing women who are allowed to resume their cycles with those kept on Lupron and given estradiol. In the 21 months since the start of this grant, 25 women, have completed or are currently enrolled. Analyses are presented on the first 24 women, 16 experimental and 8 controls, who have completed the A1- B stages. Subjects had similar baseline values for all measures at visit 1, although state, but not trait, anxiety was higher in experimentals at both visits. Stress reduced the response of peripheral blood lymphocytes to mitogens, the % of CD4+ cells, the CD4+/CD8+ ratio, and IgG production. NK activity, both % specific lysis and lytic units, was increased by stress. Unstressed controls did not show these changes. Stress elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, plasma norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (E).The number and percentage of T-cells, percentage of CD4+ cells, CD4+/CD8+ ratio, number of B-cells, serum IL-1a, and basal plasma levels of NE and DBP increased significantly from the first (follicular) to the second (Lupron-suppressed) visit in experimentals but not controls. There was also a trend for the percentage of NK cells to decrease in visit 2. However, changes in several other cardiovascular, endocrine and immunologic measures from visit #1 to #2 suggested possible habituation or practice effects. We are asking for two more years of funding to complete the study as originally designed, with the addition of the measurement of IL-6, and include another, potentially important experimental group - B (Lupron Suppression)-A1 (follicular) A1 (follicular). This group would allow us to disentangle the effects of habituation to the stressors from the effects of suppressing hormonal levels.

"ECONOMIC STRESS AMONG RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN DESCRIPTION (Applicant's Abstract):  The proposed study will examine the         relationship between economic stress and mental health outcomes for African      American women in rural communities.  Given the high prevalence of poverty       in nonmetropoltan areas and the fact that economic pressure places               individuals at greater risk for mental distress, African American women in       the Mississippi Delta region of the United States are the focal point of         this study.  The initial stage of the project will consist of approximately      20 in-depth interviews with rural African American women from various            regions in the study area.  A major focus of these semi-structured               interviews is to identify the ways in which African American women cope with     high levels of economic stress.  These interviews will aid in determining        key constructs for developing a stress vulnerability model for rural African     American women.  Considering the pervasiveness of economic disparity in the      Mississippi Delta region, the researcher expects to determine, through the       use of in-depth interview, which factors may be used to better understand        the mental health status of rural African American women.  Using information     gathered in these in-depth interviews, a set of measures will be selected        and, where needed, developed for use in a survey.  A sample of approximately     250 African American women will be selected from economically depressed          regions in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi for interviewing.  The           results from this survey will be used as a first test of the hypotheses that     merge from the literature and in-depth interviews.  Particular attention         will also be given to the differences which exist among rural African            American women with regard to vulnerability and resilience in the face of        stress.

"Ethnic Differences in Adolescents Mental Distress Examining the role of ethnicity in mental distress (depression, somatic symptoms, and suicidal behaviors) is important to overcome disparities in mental distress and to develop culturally competent prevention programs for vulnerable youth in this culturally diverse society. The specific aims of the study are to: 1) examine differences among four ethnic groups of middle school students (African, Anglo, Hispanic, and Asian Americans) in: (a) three indicators of mental distress (b) social stress (general social stress and sociocultural stress) and resources (family relationships, coping, and self-esteem) 2)(a) investigate the relations of ethnicity, resources, and the interaction of ethnicity and resources with mental distress to identify the significant resources for each ethnic group; and 2)(b)investigate the relations of ethnicity, social stress, and the interaction of ethnicity and social stress with mental distress, controlling for resources, to identify the extent to which ethnicity moderates the relation between social stress and mental distress. The sample for this cross-sectional epidemiologic study will consist of a minimum of 320 male and female middle school students. Social stress, depression, and suicidal behaviors will be measured using the Social Attitudinal, Familial, and Environmental Stress Scale for Children (SAFE-C), DSM scale for depression (DSD), and Youth Risk Behavior survey (YRBS) questionnaire, respectively. Resources will be measured using the Family Environment Scale (FES) and age-appropriate adaptations of two existing coping scales and Rosenberg?s Self-Esteem Scale.

"Prejudice as Stress  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Prejudice, discrimination and alienation create a stressful social environment for many minority groups in American society.  Such stressful conditions can lead to adverse mental and physical health outcomes.   These statements, describing a ""minority stress"" hypothesis, seem incontrovertible:  The hypothesis echoes theoretical writings in the social sciences and reflects lay experiences as portrayed in literary and personal accounts.  Some scientific evidence seems to support it, for example, that African American men have higher rates of hypertension than their white counterparts.  However, when placed under scientific scrutiny, the minority stress hypothesis is not easily confirmed.  Scientific evidence has not clearly supported what seems like a simple idea, that minority group members suffer health consequences of prejudice and discrimination.  Scientific research and scholarly work in the area raise significant questions.  The answers we give to these questions have serious public policy, public health, and ethical implications for society.  These complex issues are the topic of the proposed book.  I seek to conduct a comprehensive critical review of research and popular works on the relationship between prejudice and health.  In the book I will analyze the minority stress hypothesis and relevant findings using a broad perspective that addresses scientific and medical issues and their social and ethical implications.  The book will be significant in two ways:  It will provide a needed comprehensive integrated review of theory and research findings; and it will begin a discussion on how American society can address issues of health and quality of life for the diverse groups that compose it.  These issues are related to one of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2010, in that they address causes for health disparities in the United States.

"Racial Stress Coping Scale DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Research statement: One aspect of my research concerns the relationship between psychological processes and cardiovascular responses.  The psychological processes under investigation include exposure to racism, hostility, modes of anger expression, and styles of coping.  These characteristics are examined for their relationship to stress-induced increases in blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance.  A second aspect focuses on the role of constitutional factors in cardiovascular reactivity to stress.  Recent studies have focused on race, gender and socioeconomic status.  Our stressors include discussions of racism, discussions of anger experiences, racism film stressors, and naturalistic stressors.

"Community Response to Maternal/Child Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Our academic and community-based collaborative will plan a multi-site, multi-level study that examines the interrelating biological and social-behavioral factors that contribute to health disparities in pregnancy outcomes and infant and early childhood mortality and morbidity.      The overall hypothesis of Proposed Study #1 is that compared to women who deliver at term, those who deliver preterm have increased psychosocial stress, HPA hyperactivity, cytokilne dysregulation, cervico-vaginal infection and inflammation, and maladaptive stress-coping behavior. Women who deliver preterm are also more likely to have greater genetic, psychological, behavioral, and environmental susceptibilities to these stress-mediated pathways to preterm delivery. The increased prematurely risk among African Americans is partially related to both increased exposures and increased vulnerabilities to stress. Using multi-level analyses, we will examine the relationship between stress and preterm delivery in the context of racial-ethnic differences in genetic, neuroendocdne, immunologic, behavioral psychosocial and environmental vulnerabilities. The subjects will undergo serial assessments during pregnancy of psychosocial stress, HPA activity, cytokine expression, infection-inflammation, gone polymorphism, and multi-level protective and risk factors. These parameters will be compared between women who deliver preterm (cases) and term (matched controls).      The overall hypothesis of Proposed Study # 2 is that, compared to those who do not develop reactive airway disease, infants who develop asthma by age 3 are more likely to inherit disease susceptibility genotypes, experience increased psychosocial stress and exaggerated neonatal hypothalamic- pituitary axis reactivity, and impaired parentchildinteraction. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the increased risk of reactive airway disease amongst African American and Hispanic children is partially related to increased environmental stress exposures and partially related to increased biologic susceptibility to asthma due to inherited genotypes and increased susceptibility to stress. Both studies are cohort studies with nested case-control design. 25,000 pregnant women will be recruited per year over a four-year study period. The proposed study requires that one-third of study participants be women who self identify as Black or African American, and one-third Asian or Hispanic.      The long range goal of this study is to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in birth and child health outcomes through novel research programs conducted through an academic-community collaborative in the richly diverse communities of Los Angeles County.

"Prejudice as Stress  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Prejudice, discrimination and alienation create a stressful social environment for many minority groups in American society.  Such stressful conditions can lead to adverse mental and physical health outcomes.   These statements, describing a ""minority stress"" hypothesis, seem incontrovertible:  The hypothesis echoes theoretical writings in the social sciences and reflects lay experiences as portrayed in literary and personal accounts.  Some scientific evidence seems to support it, for example, that African American men have higher rates of hypertension than their white counterparts.  However, when placed under scientific scrutiny, the minority stress hypothesis is not easily confirmed.  Scientific evidence has not clearly supported what seems like a simple idea, that minority group members suffer health consequences of prejudice and discrimination.  Scientific research and scholarly work in the area raise significant questions.  The answers we give to these questions have serious public policy, public health, and ethical implications for society.  These complex issues are the topic of the proposed book.  I seek to conduct a comprehensive critical review of research and popular works on the relationship between prejudice and health.  In the book I will analyze the minority stress hypothesis and relevant findings using a broad perspective that addresses scientific and medical issues and their social and ethical implications.  The book will be significant in two ways:  It will provide a needed comprehensive integrated review of theory and research findings; and it will begin a discussion on how American society can address issues of health and quality of life for the diverse groups that compose it.  These issues are related to one of the overarching goals of Healthy People 2010, in that they address causes for health disparities in the United States.

"Housing Stress and Wheeze/Asthma in Urban Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This award aims to extend the candidate's growing expertise in socioeconomic dimensions in housing as it relates to health disparities focusing in particular on childhood asthma risk. The candidate completed a fellowship in academic pediatrics, earning an MPH from Boston University School of Public Health in epidemiology, biostatistics and environmental health. Further research training will occur under the supervision of a multi-disciplinary Advisory Committee with expertise in asthma, life stress, housing, allergens, immunology, and qualitative research. Career development will be enhanced through course work and participation in seminars and research on stress and housing factors. This award, along with the candidate's clinical and scientific background, will facilitate the development of a successful independent research career with a focus on the epidemiological study of the influence of both social and physical dimensions of housing conditions on childhood asthma morbidity in the inner city. While many epidemiological studies describe associations between poor housing and health (including asthma), none have considered the psychological dimension of housing quality either independently or in combination with physical housing characteristics as related to asthma risk. The investigators hypothesize that children exposed to higher level housing stress will be at greater risk for asthma/wheeze syndromes, independent of other life stressors (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage or violence) and exposures associated with poor housing (e.g., cockroach or rodent). Furthermore, they hypothesize higher-level housing stress, assessed annually in the first three years of life, will predict subsequent increased total IgE levels and allergen-specific lymphocyte proliferative response in the child at age 3 years controlled for these other risk factors.  Study of the relative importance of housing stress in urban populations may result in more targeted housing interventions and policy change to impact public health.

"New Treatment for Chronic Traumatic Stress in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by candidate):  There is mounting evidence that children growing up in low-income urban environments are exposed to severe, ongoing trauma and develop symptoms of complex traumatic stress at disproportionate rates. Repeated exposure creates a complex set of reactions that occur before, during, and after traumatic events and carries long-term developmental risks. Although exposure to and effects of chronic trauma in children from low-income, urban environments has been labeled a public health concern, there is little empirical support for available treatments. Modification of existing treatments or development of new treatments is necessary for improving the standard of care for this population. This application will prepare me to transition from clinician/administrator to interventions researcher with the goal of developing and testing treatments for this group of children. The proposed training and research agenda provide an opportunity to draw together and advance two areas that have strong theoretical foundations for strengthening child and family coping (trauma treatment and ritual/routine practice). Specific training goals involve acquiring new skills in biostatisties related to testing causal models, developing conceptual and methodological understanding of treatment development and testing, and gaining new tools for ensuring that the interventions developed are appropriate for the target population. Specific objectives of the research plan focus on development of a family skills-based intervention, but allow me to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to create a range of interventions (for families, schools, neighborhoods) and thus, accomplish my long-term goals. The research plan comprises two phases. The initial phase uses a cross sectional design to examine a theoretical model linking symptoms of chronic traumatic stress with a specified mechanism of change (constructive use of family rituals). Phase I includes a qualitative sub-study to further explore the ritual and routine practice of minority families dealing with the major stressors and traumas associated with urban poverty. Phase II is designed to produce a skill-building intervention, focused on the specified family ritual dimensions determined in Phase I, for families of children exhibiting symptoms of complex traumatic stress. This phase includes an open trials pilot to demonstrate feasibility of implementation. The proposed research provides preliminary data for an R34 application and lays the foundation for future R01applications.

"Stress, Environment, and Genetics in Urban Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal is to examine the role of psychosocial stressors in a systems biology framework considering multiple biologic pathways by which stress can contribute to asthma causation. We will not only study the independent effect of stress on asthma/wheeze phenotypes in early childhood but also will consider stress as a modifier of physical environmental factors (allergens, cigarette smoking and diesel-related air pollutants) and genetic predisposition on asthma risk. We will determine the independent effect of maternal stress (both prenatal and postnatal) on early childhood asthma phenotypes. We further hypothesize that multi-life stressors prevalent in disadvantaged populations can cumulatively influence immune system development and airway inflammation in early life, thus making the populations more susceptible to other environmental factors and genetic risk factors explaining, in part, observed asthma disparities associated with SES and race/ethnicity. We will take a multi-level approach, measuring both individual-level stress (negative life events, perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety) and community-level stress [neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., percent of subjects living in poverty, percent unemployed), diminished social capital, and high crime/violence rates]. We will also assess the influence of stress on the infant hormonal stress response and on T-helper cell differentiation as reflected in cytokine profiles and IgE expression (a topic or pro inflammatory phenotype). Additional physical environmental (indoor allergens, diesel-related air pollutants, tobacco smoke) and genetic factors will be assessed given their influence on the immune response and expression of early childhood asthma/wheeze. This interdisciplinary approach is unique because we are considering the context in which physical exposures and host susceptibility occurs, analyzing their multiplicative joint effects and considering multiple biologic pathways, as such it is consistent with the NIH roadmap objectives.

"Identity, minority stress and mental health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Researchers have established that gay men and lesbians suffer from mental health problems more than heterosexuals. This disparity results in part from the unique set of stress experiences that gay men and lesbians face as members of a socially stigmatized minority group. Yet all lesbians and gay men do not experience similar levels of stress, nor do they react in similar ways to stressful events. The aim of the proposed research is to test predictions derived from a new conceptual model of gay-related stress in order to better understand individual differences in the gay-related stress experience. In this model, variations in gay/lesbian identity are hypothesized to influence exposure to gay-related stressors and to moderate the association between stress exposure and mental health outcomes. A critical goal of this research is to establish a new paradigm for examining individual differences in gay/lesbian identity using a dual-identity framework assessing affiliations with both gay and mainstream/heterosexual communities. Two studies, a cross-sectional survey and a two-week daily experience study, will test predictions derived from the proposed model associating gay/lesbian identity, gay-related stress exposure, and mental health.

"Aging, Acculturation, and Health: Korean American Elders The proposed study is in response to the NIA Behavioral and Social Research on Aging (BSR) special initiative #1 Health Disparities. The investigation focuses on one of the fastest-growing but understudied minority populations: Korean American elders. The underlying concern is with the significance of experiences associated with aging, acculturation, and health. Guided by a stress and coping model, the study conceptualizes health conditions and acculturation as potential stressors, health perception and acculturative stressfulness as appraisals, a variety of psychosocial and cultural factors as coping resources, and subjective well-being as outcome. Subjective well-being is indexed by depressive symptoms and life satisfaction. Specific aims are: (1) to assess the connections between potential stressors (health conditions and acculturation) and outcomes (depressive symptoms and life satisfaction), (2) to examine whether the connections between stressors and outcomes are mediated through appraisals (health perceptions and acculturative stressfulness), and (3) to examine how psychosocial and cultural resources (sense of mastery, social network, social support, religiosity, filial satisfaction, and family solidarity) modify the connections among stressors, appraisals, and outcomes. Probability samples of Korean American older adults aged 65 and older (n=310) will be drawn from two cities in Florida. Face-to-face interviews will be conducted using the Korean version of a structured questionnaire. A series of regression analyses with tests of direct, mediating, and moderating effects will provide answers for the proposed research questions. The unique approach with the differentiation of acculturative stressfulness from the level of acculturation will not only address the conventional stress model but also specific issues sensitive to the study population. Elucidation of the intervening roles of health perception and acculturative stressfulness may guide intervention strategies to prevent or minimize the adverse emotional consequences of stressors by altering negative perceptions of and attitudes towards stressors. Further, the identification of protective psychosocial and cultural resources will serve as a basis for developing/implementing culturally competent and effective social services and programs. This study is an important step in expanding our understanding of the unique experiences of minority elders; further research will be developed based on the results from this pilot research.

Women who deliver preterm are also more likely to have greater genetic, psychological, behavioral, and environmental susceptibilities to these stress-mediated pathways to preterm delivery. The increased prematurely risk among African Americans is partially related to both increased exposures and increased vulnerabilities to stress. Using multi-level analyses, we will examine the relationship between stress and preterm delivery in the context of racial-ethnic differences in genetic, neuroendocdne, immunologic, behavioral psychosocial and environmental vulnerabilities. The subjects will undergo serial assessments during pregnancy of psychosocial stress, HPA activity, cytokine expression, infection-inflammation, gone polymorphism, and multi-level protective and risk factors. These parameters will be compared between women who deliver preterm (cases) and term (matched controls).      The overall hypothesis of Proposed Study # 2 is that, compared to those who do not develop reactive airway disease, infants who develop asthma by age 3 are more likely to inherit disease susceptibility genotypes, experience increased psychosocial stress and exaggerated neonatal hypothalamic- pituitary axis reactivity, and impaired parentchildinteraction. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the increased risk of reactive airway disease amongst African American and Hispanic children is partially related to increased environmental stress exposures and partially related to increased biologic susceptibility to asthma due to inherited genotypes and increased susceptibility to stress. Both studies are cohort studies with nested case-control design. 25,000 pregnant women will be recruited per year over a four-year study period. The proposed study requires that one-third of study participants be women who self identify as Black or African American, and one-third Asian or Hispanic.      The long range goal of this study is to reduce racial-ethnic disparities in birth and child health outcomes through novel research programs conducted through an academic-community collaborative in the richly diverse communities of Los Angeles County.

"Cells to Society (C2s): The Center on Social Disparities and Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The three signature themes guiding our research are: social disparities, stress, and health; families, interpersonal relationships, and health; and developmental perspectives on health disparities from conception through adulthood. The goals of our proposed activities are to: (i) become an international locus for information about and training in the use of biomarkers in population research; (ii) expand and strengthen our signature programs of population research; (iii) initiate new types of interdisciplinary, collaborative research projects that span the social and life sciences; (iv) mentor and develop young scientists; (v) increase external funding; and (vi) translate research findings for practice and policy. With regard to biomarkers, C2S faculty would expand their work on development of ""field-friendly"" methods for assessing biomarkers of human health and development. Key goals are to develop methods for assaying new biomarkers, provide technical assistance for incorporating these methods into national and community surveys, and, through an annual summer workshop, train students and faculty in using and analyzing biomarker data in population surveys. With regard to new research activities, our focus in social disparities and health include cross-national studies of stress and culture, studies of racial and ethnic disparities in the U.S., biologically-based studies of stress and psychological health, and studies of stress and socioeconomic elements of both families and neighborhoods. Our focus on interpersonal relationships and health includes studies of family stress and child well-being, and prejudice and stereotyping in inter-group relations. Our focus on developmental perspectives on health include studies of how prenatal and neo-natal environments affect child well-being and adult health, and developmental influences on adult reproductive function. Consistent throughout our proposed work is the emphasis on population-level health and well-being through the use, where possible, of representative samples from target populations of interest. Our research-based mentoring and curriculum-based instruction will train a new cadre of young researchers whose mastery of both biological and population-based methods will equip them to engage in the kind of integrative, multi- method, interdisciplinary approaches to population health research envisioned by the NIH Roadmap.

"Housing Stress and Wheeze/Asthma in Urban Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This award aims to extend the candidate's growing expertise in socioeconomic dimensions in housing as it relates to health disparities focusing in particular on childhood asthma risk. The candidate completed a fellowship in academic pediatrics, earning an MPH from Boston University School of Public Health in epidemiology, biostatistics and environmental health. Further research training will occur under the supervision of a multi-disciplinary Advisory Committee with expertise in asthma, life stress, housing, allergens, immunology, and qualitative research. Career development will be enhanced through course work and participation in seminars and research on stress and housing factors. This award, along with the candidate's clinical and scientific background, will facilitate the development of a successful independent research career with a focus on the epidemiological study of the influence of both social and physical dimensions of housing conditions on childhood asthma morbidity in the inner city. While many epidemiological studies describe associations between poor housing and health (including asthma), none have considered the psychological dimension of housing quality either independently or in combination with physical housing characteristics as related to asthma risk. The investigators hypothesize that children exposed to higher level housing stress will be at greater risk for asthma/wheeze syndromes, independent of other life stressors (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage or violence) and exposures associated with poor housing (e.g., cockroach or rodent). Furthermore, they hypothesize higher-level housing stress, assessed annually in the first three years of life, will predict subsequent increased total IgE levels and allergen-specific lymphocyte proliferative response in the child at age 3 years controlled for these other risk factors.  Study of the relative importance of housing stress in urban populations may result in more targeted housing interventions and policy change to impact public health.

"New Treatment for Chronic Traumatic Stress in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by candidate):  There is mounting evidence that children growing up in low-income urban environments are exposed to severe, ongoing trauma and develop symptoms of complex traumatic stress at disproportionate rates. Repeated exposure creates a complex set of reactions that occur before, during, and after traumatic events and carries long-term developmental risks. Although exposure to and effects of chronic trauma in children from low-income, urban environments has been labeled a public health concern, there is little empirical support for available treatments. Modification of existing treatments or development of new treatments is necessary for improving the standard of care for this population. This application will prepare me to transition from clinician/administrator to interventions researcher with the goal of developing and testing treatments for this group of children. The proposed training and research agenda provide an opportunity to draw together and advance two areas that have strong theoretical foundations for strengthening child and family coping (trauma treatment and ritual/routine practice). Specific training goals involve acquiring new skills in biostatisties related to testing causal models, developing conceptual and methodological understanding of treatment development and testing, and gaining new tools for ensuring that the interventions developed are appropriate for the target population. Specific objectives of the research plan focus on development of a family skills-based intervention, but allow me to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to create a range of interventions (for families, schools, neighborhoods) and thus, accomplish my long-term goals. The research plan comprises two phases. The initial phase uses a cross sectional design to examine a theoretical model linking symptoms of chronic traumatic stress with a specified mechanism of change (constructive use of family rituals). Phase I includes a qualitative sub-study to further explore the ritual and routine practice of minority families dealing with the major stressors and traumas associated with urban poverty. Phase II is designed to produce a skill-building intervention, focused on the specified family ritual dimensions determined in Phase I, for families of children exhibiting symptoms of complex traumatic stress. This phase includes an open trials pilot to demonstrate feasibility of implementation. The proposed research provides preliminary data for an R34 application and lays the foundation for future R01applications.

"Identity, minority stress and mental health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Researchers have established that gay men and lesbians suffer from mental health problems more than heterosexuals. This disparity results in part from the unique set of stress experiences that gay men and lesbians face as members of a socially stigmatized minority group. Yet all lesbians and gay men do not experience similar levels of stress, nor do they react in similar ways to stressful events. The aim of the proposed research is to test predictions derived from a new conceptual model of gay-related stress in order to better understand individual differences in the gay-related stress experience. In this model, variations in gay/lesbian identity are hypothesized to influence exposure to gay-related stressors and to moderate the association between stress exposure and mental health outcomes. A critical goal of this research is to establish a new paradigm for examining individual differences in gay/lesbian identity using a dual-identity framework assessing affiliations with both gay and mainstream/heterosexual communities. Two studies, a cross-sectional survey and a two-week daily experience study, will test predictions derived from the proposed model associating gay/lesbian identity, gay-related stress exposure, and mental health.

"Stress, Environment, and Genetics in Urban Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal is to examine the role of psychosocial stressors in a systems biology framework considering multiple biologic pathways by which stress can contribute to asthma causation. We will not only study the independent effect of stress on asthma/wheeze phenotypes in early childhood but also will consider stress as a modifier of physical environmental factors (allergens, cigarette smoking and diesel-related air pollutants) and genetic predisposition on asthma risk. We will determine the independent effect of maternal stress (both prenatal and postnatal) on early childhood asthma phenotypes. We further hypothesize that multi-life stressors prevalent in disadvantaged populations can cumulatively influence immune system development and airway inflammation in early life, thus making the populations more susceptible to other environmental factors and genetic risk factors explaining, in part, observed asthma disparities associated with SES and race/ethnicity. We will take a multi-level approach, measuring both individual-level stress (negative life events, perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety) and community-level stress [neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., percent of subjects living in poverty, percent unemployed), diminished social capital, and high crime/violence rates]. We will also assess the influence of stress on the infant hormonal stress response and on T-helper cell differentiation as reflected in cytokine profiles and IgE expression (a topic or pro inflammatory phenotype). Additional physical environmental (indoor allergens, diesel-related air pollutants, tobacco smoke) and genetic factors will be assessed given their influence on the immune response and expression of early childhood asthma/wheeze. This interdisciplinary approach is unique because we are considering the context in which physical exposures and host susceptibility occurs, analyzing their multiplicative joint effects and considering multiple biologic pathways, as such it is consistent with the NIH roadmap objectives.

The psychological processes under investigation include exposure to racism, hostility, modes of anger expression, and styles of coping.  These characteristics are examined for their relationship to stress-induced increases in blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance.  A second aspect focuses on the role of constitutional factors in cardiovascular reactivity to stress.  Recent studies have focused on race, gender and socioeconomic status.  Our stressors include discussions of racism, discussions of anger experiences, racism film stressors, and naturalistic stressors.

"Tools for Measuring and Analyzing Cortisol Levels in Population Studies of Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in health by socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity have been documented for numerous health outcomes. Developing a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons for health disparities that integrates factors defined at multiple levels (e.g. from community-level or neighborhood processes to biological factors) and that explicates common or interrelated processes that generate disparities in multiple health conditions remains a major challenge. This is important not only to understand the etiology of multiple diseases, but also to develop strategies to eliminate health disparities. One process that has been hypothesized to contribute to disparities in multiple health domains is psychosocial stress. It has been argued that exposure to psychosocial stressors repeatedly over long periods has biological consequences with implications for multiple health conditions, including outcomes as diverse as low birth weight, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. Two major challenges in studying the role of psychosocial stress include the (1) measurement and characterization of biological markers of the stress response (2) examining how this complex biological response varies as a function of higher-level (or upstream) determinants such as socioeconomic position and community characteristics. We propose to address both challenges through the development of methodological tools necessary to characterize and analyze biomarkers of the stress response (specifically cortisol profiles) in population-based studies. The overall goal of our project is to improve the methodological tools and data collection protocols necessary to understand how upstream determinants (such as neighborhood-level factors) trigger biological processes (specifically the stress response) that may generate disparities in multiple disease outcomes in the population. We will use a unique multilevel dataset to investigate the use of different methodological approaches in order to make specific recommendations regarding (a) data collection protocols for salivary cortisol data (specifically regarding number and timing of samples) and (b) data analyses involving cortisol profiles as outcomes or predictors The specific aims of our project are: (1) To investigate and contrast statistical methods useful in characterizing different features of the biological stress response, as assessed by repeat measures of salivary cortisol. (2) To examine measurement properties of the features of the cortisol curve in order to be able to make specific recommendations regarding the best data collection tools and protocols in future studies and (3) To investigate and contrast methods useful in examining how features of the stress response curve are related to neighborhood and individual-level predictors as well as to individual-level outcomes. Addressing these Aims will improve the tools available to researchers to study how communities and neighborhoods trigger biological processes in humans that relate to health disparities in the population (one of the stated aims of this RFA). Relevance Persistent and pronounced differences in health by race/ethnicity (often termed health disparities) and by socioeconomic position have been documented for many different health outcomes. The reasons for these disparities remain a subject for research. Psychosocial factors have been hypothesized to be important contributors to these disparities but the tools available to characterize and analyze the biologic consequences of psychosocial stress remain limited. By developing tools necessary to measure and analyze biologic markers of the stress response, our project will contribute to the study for the reasons for health disparities in multiple health outcomes.

"Effects of Stress and Inflammatory Cytokines on Pregnancy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor pregnancy outcomes and complications such as low birthweight, preeclampsia, prematurity, and gestational diabetes continue to be a significant problem in the United States, particularly for women who are members of ethnic minorities. Psychosocial factors contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes, and proinflammatory aspects of the immune system may be involved in these effects. Although work in our laboratory and others supports connections between prenatal stress and poor outcome, the mechanisms of these relationships remain unclear. We hypothesize that that prenatal maternal stress and low social support increase levels of proinflammatory cytokines during pregnancy and that these changes increase the probability of poor pregnancy outcomes. The proposed R21 project extends our preliminary data, which suggests that high stress during pregnancy is related to elevated proinflammatory cytokines and poor outcome, perform comprehensive analyses of the effects of stress on cytokines during pregnancy, to add assessment of the role of social support in this relationship, and to determine the degree to which these changes can be used to make clinically useful predictions of at-risk pregnancies. An important aspect of this project is that we will study an ethnically diverse population (predominately Caucasian women and Latinas) which will extend the usefulness of the work in developing understanding of ethnic disparities in these relationships. This R21 project tests the hypothesis that high stress and low social support increase maternal production of proinflammatory cytokines during pregnancy (Specific Aim 1) and that this increased production is associated with pregnancy complications and poor outcome (Specific Aim 2). Further, a mathematical modeling approach is proposed to begin to determine the possible clinical usefulness of cytokine levels and stress in identifying pregnancies that are at risk for poor outcomes (Specific Aim 3). An additional aspect of the project is beginning to assess the role of maternal ethnicity in these interactions to explore biobehavioral factors that contribute to the disproportionate occurrence of pregnancy complications in minority women. It is clear that maternal stress can alter pregnancy outcome, although these effects are currently not well- understood. This project tests the hypothesis that high prenatal stress increases production of proinflammatory cytokines in pregnant women in a manner which contributes to poor pregnancy outcomes. We will use a prospective approach to assess stress, social support and cytokine production throughout pregnancy to see if these changes are predictive of poor outcome in a large, multi-ethnic sample.          ",Effects of Stress and Inflammatory Cytokines on Pregnancy,7254623,R21HD052544,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Premature Labor ', ' Preterm Labor ', ' Premature Obstetric Labor ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Probability ', ' Production ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' prenatal stress ', ' fetal stress ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' experience ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' member ', ' Prematurity of fetus ', ' premature fetus ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' cytokine ', ' Early identification ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER/HSC DENVER,R21,2007,178750,0.03918736991625329

"Racial Stress Coping Scale DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Research statement: One aspect of my research concerns the relationship between psychological processes and cardiovascular responses.  The psychological processes under investigation include exposure to racism, hostility, modes of anger expression, and styles of coping.  These characteristics are examined for their relationship to stress-induced increases in blood pressure, cardiac output, and total peripheral resistance.  A second aspect focuses on the role of constitutional factors in cardiovascular reactivity to stress.  Recent studies have focused on race, gender and socioeconomic status.  Our stressors include discussions of racism, discussions of anger experiences, racism film stressors, and naturalistic stressors.  Finally, we are beginning new research on the psychophysiology of coping.  Other research examines risky sexual behavior among university students and African American women and body image.

"Stress, Environment, and Genetics in Urban Asthma The overall goal is to examine the role of psychosocial stressors in a systems biology framework considering multiple biologic pathways by which stress can contribute to asthma causation. We will not only study the independent effect of stress on asthma/wheeze phenotypes in early childhood but also will consider stress as a modifier of physical environmental factors (allergens, cigarette smoking and diesel-related air pollutants) and genetic predisposition on asthma risk. We will determine the independent effect of maternal stress (both prenatal and postnatal) on early childhood asthma phenotypes. We further hypothesize that multi-life stressors prevalent in disadvantaged populations can cumulatively influence immune system development and airway inflammation in early life, thus making the populations more susceptible to other environmental factors and genetic risk factors explaining, in part, observed asthma disparities associated with SES and race/ethnicity. We will take a multi-level approach, measuring both individual-level stress (negative life events, perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety) and community-level stress [neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., percent of subjects living in poverty, percent unemployed), diminished social capital, and high crime/violence rates]. We will also assess the influence of stress on the infant hormonal stress response and on T-helper cell differentiation as reflected in cytokine profiles and IgE expression (atopic or proinflammatory phenotype). Additional physical environmental (indoor allergens, diesel-related air pollutants, tobacco smoke) and genetic factors will be assessed given their influence on the immune response and expression of early childhood asthma/wheeze. This interdisciplinary approach is unique because we are considering the context in which physical exposures and host susceptibility occurs, analyzing their multiplicative joint effects and considering multiple biologic pathways, as such it is consistent with the NIH roadmap objectives.

"Cells to Society (C2s): The Center on Social Disparities and Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The three signature themes guiding our research are: social disparities, stress, and health; families, interpersonal relationships, and health; and developmental perspectives on health disparities from conception through adulthood. The goals of our proposed activities are to: (i) become an international locus for information about and training in the use of biomarkers in population research; (ii) expand and strengthen our signature programs of population research; (iii) initiate new types of interdisciplinary, collaborative research projects that span the social and life sciences; (iv) mentor and develop young scientists; (v) increase external funding; and (vi) translate research findings for practice and policy. With regard to biomarkers, C2S faculty would expand their work on development of ""field-friendly"" methods for assessing biomarkers of human health and development. Key goals are to develop methods for assaying new biomarkers, provide technical assistance for incorporating these methods into national and community surveys, and, through an annual summer workshop, train students and faculty in using and analyzing biomarker data in population surveys. With regard to new research activities, our focus in social disparities and health include cross-national studies of stress and culture, studies of racial and ethnic disparities in the U.S., biologically-based studies of stress and psychological health, and studies of stress and socioeconomic elements of both families and neighborhoods. Our focus on interpersonal relationships and health includes studies of family stress and child well-being, and prejudice and stereotyping in inter-group relations. Our focus on developmental perspectives on health include studies of how prenatal and neo-natal environments affect child well-being and adult health, and developmental influences on adult reproductive function. Consistent throughout our proposed work is the emphasis on population-level health and well-being through the use, where possible, of representative samples from target populations of interest. Our research-based mentoring and curriculum-based instruction will train a new cadre of young researchers whose mastery of both biological and population-based methods will equip them to engage in the kind of integrative, multi- method, interdisciplinary approaches to population health research envisioned by the NIH Roadmap.

"Housing Stress and Wheeze/Asthma in Urban Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This award aims to extend the candidate's growing expertise in socioeconomic dimensions in housing as it relates to health disparities focusing in particular on childhood asthma risk. The candidate completed a fellowship in academic pediatrics, earning an MPH from Boston University School of Public Health in epidemiology, biostatistics and environmental health. Further research training will occur under the supervision of a multi-disciplinary Advisory Committee with expertise in asthma, life stress, housing, allergens, immunology, and qualitative research. Career development will be enhanced through course work and participation in seminars and research on stress and housing factors. This award, along with the candidate's clinical and scientific background, will facilitate the development of a successful independent research career with a focus on the epidemiological study of the influence of both social and physical dimensions of housing conditions on childhood asthma morbidity in the inner city. While many epidemiological studies describe associations between poor housing and health (including asthma), none have considered the psychological dimension of housing quality either independently or in combination with physical housing characteristics as related to asthma risk. The investigators hypothesize that children exposed to higher level housing stress will be at greater risk for asthma/wheeze syndromes, independent of other life stressors (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage or violence) and exposures associated with poor housing (e.g., cockroach or rodent). Furthermore, they hypothesize higher-level housing stress, assessed annually in the first three years of life, will predict subsequent increased total IgE levels and allergen-specific lymphocyte proliferative response in the child at age 3 years controlled for these other risk factors.  Study of the relative importance of housing stress in urban populations may result in more targeted housing interventions and policy change to impact public health.

"Stress, Lead, Iron Deficiency and Neurodevelopment    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Social stressors, iron deficiency anemia, and lead exposure are all environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopment in young children. All three factors are highly prevalent in poor communities, whether in Mexico or the U.S. There are scant human epidemiologic studies on chronic social stress and human neurodevelopment. In addition, previous studies of child development and neurotoxicants have typically analyzed covariate markers of social stress as independent predictors of neurodevelopment; and thus, only considered social factors as potential confounders in their data analysis. There are biological reasons to believe that stress potentiates the toxicity of iron deficiency anemia and lead poisoning. If so, then understanding this relationship may be the key to designing effective public health interventions designed to improve neurodevelopment and may explain the lack of effectiveness of prevention/treatment regimens for lead poisoning and iron deficiency. A prospective cohort study with a large sample size is needed to address the potential multiplicative effects of combined stress/iron deficiency anemia and combined stress/lead exposure in predicting infant development. This resubmission includes new data from a pilot study of stress-lead/stress-anemia interactions in 120 mother infant pairs conducted since the prior application, which demonstrates study feasibility and evidence for the hypothesized interactions. In this application we will measure maternal stress levels, infant iron deficiency anemia and lead exposure in a cohort of mother-infant pairs living in Mexico City and longitudinally measure maternal stress, iron stores, lead exposure, salivary cortisol and neurodevelopment beginning pre-natally and extending 3 years post-partum. This project will determine the independent effect of pre- and post-partum maternal stress in predicting infant development, and the multiplicative joint effects of maternal stress/iron deficiency and maternal stress/lead poisoning in predicting infant development.           ","Stress, Lead, Iron Deficiency and Neurodevelopment",7209568,R01ES013744,"['Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Sample Size ', ' Funding ', ' Mexico ', ' Mothers ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Neurotoxins ', ' neurotoxicant ', ' nutrition ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' Anemia ', ' Iron ', ' Fe element ', ' Animals ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Poisoning ', ' poisoned ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' Archives ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Dietary Iron ', ' Life ', ' Area Under Curve ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Toxicology ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' day ', ' Complex ', ' Salivary ', ' Score ', ' interest ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Medical center ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' American ', ' British ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Toxic effect ', ' Toxicities ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' developmental psychology ', ' human developmental psychology ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' Measures ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Mediating ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Outcome ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' neurotoxicity ', ' neuronal toxicity ', ' neuron toxicity ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Economics ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Age-Months ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' International ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Modification ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Iron deficiency anemia ', ' Malnutrition ', ' nutritional deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency disorder ', ' nutrition deficiency ', ' dietary deficiency ', ' Undernutrition ', ' Nutritional Deficiency ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Hemoglobin ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Infant Development ', ' Link ', ' indexing ', ' Infant ', ' Institutes ', ' Chemicals ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead Poisoning ', ' toxicity to lead ', ' toxic effect to lead ', ' plumbism ', ' lead toxicity ', ' lead toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ toxic effect ', ' Pb2+ poisoning ', ' Pb2+ lead toxicity ', ' Pb2+ Toxicity ', ' Pb toxic effect ', ' Pb poisoning ', ' Pb lead toxicity ', ' ']",NIEHS,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2007,470911,0.06688318764654964
"Social Influences on Early Adult Stress Biomarkers    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of our project is to conduct a population-level investigation of social contexts, stress, and health. We integrate multiple biomarkers of stress with current theory and measurement tools from the social and behavioral sciences to gain a better understanding of how social contexts ""get under the skin"" to affect stress and health in young adults. We use data from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) in pursuit of three objectives: 1) Examine the interrelations among multiple subjective and physiological measures of stress; 2) Investigate how measures of socio-economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships in childhood/adolescence and over the transition to adulthood influence stress in early adulthood; and 3) Test competing theoretical models of the joint influence of socio- economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships on stress. We examine subjective measures of stress, including perceived stress, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of anxiety, as well as physiological measures of endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and inflammatory activity. We take advantage of the breadth and depth of the Add Health dataset to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date of how social stress affects physical and mental health. Additionally, the large sample size and racial, ethnic, and economic diversity of Add Health allow us to investigate the extent to which stress leads to health disparities. Stress is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, and investigating the physiological mechanisms through which social contexts affect human health can help investigators, clinicians, and policy makers to: a) identify adverse psychosocial environments; b) better understand predisease and disease pathways; and c) inform interventions to reduce exposure to stressors, reduce the adverse impact of stressors on physiology, and prevent the emergence of stress-related disorders.              ",Social Influences on Early Adult Stress Biomarkers,7264993,R01HD053731,"['Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Advocate ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Range ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' allostatic load ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human Development ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Economic Factors ', ' Economical Factors ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Sample Size ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Metabolic ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Inflammatory ', ' tool ', ' Anxiety ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' Behavior ', ' Endocrine ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' stress related disorder ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Population ', ' Stress Tests ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' ']",NICHD,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,292359,0.2008389977109427

Contemporary research with SM has sought to determine which processes mediate this relationship. Theorists have offered several potential mediators, but a consensus of which processes act as mediators does not exist among theorists. Meyer (2003) has offered the minority stress hypothesis as an explanatory model. His model posits that three mediation processes exist: prejudice events, stigma consciousness, and internalized homophobia. The proposed study seeks to test the minority stress hypothesis in a diverse sample of SM college males and females from the Pacific Northwest via the Internet. African American and Latino groups, though, often experience other factors that may have a negative effect on their mental health that are not included in the model (e.g., racist discrimination), which may make the model inappropriate for these individuals. The proposed study also seeks to test the minority stress hypothesis in a sample comprised entirely of SM African American and Latino college students. Should the model be inappropriate, a third model will be constructed that incorporates variables such as racist discrimination, family religiosity, and importance of being supported by one's family.          ",MINORITY PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM,7321677,F31HD054022,"['Demographic Factors ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Institution ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Range ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Family ', ' Support of Research ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fellowship ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' Bisexual ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Oregon ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Prejudice ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Anxiety ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Stigmata ', ' Consensus ', ' Victimization ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Washington ', ' Event ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Diamond ', ' experience ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Disease regression ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' model design ', ' Communities ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2007,32490,0.04593714504417929
"The Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma from Terror: A Developmental Perspec    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed work addresses a key goal of NIMH Program Announcement PA-07-312, which seeks to enhance scientific understanding about the etiology of psychopathology related to violence and trauma"". The almost 4000 missiles that fell within Northern Israel in the summer of 2006, the damage suffered by property and persons, and the confinement of many families in bomb shelters during the terror period created a unique 'naturalistic' laboratory for assessing the effects of PTSD caused by exposure to a circumscribed period of terror. Within this context, we will examine the health and behavior of fetuses and birth parameters of pregnant women who were residents of the North at the time of the war and test for gene and environmental moderation of fetal and birth measures. We will study two groups: (1) 150 women who are residents of cities attacked during the ""war"" and who meet full criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of their exposure to attacks, and (2) 150 women from the same cohort, who show no symptoms of PTSD. The study will be the first study to examine fetal health and behavior in pregnant women with PTSD and the first study to test for gene-based vulnerabilities and Gene x Environment on these measures. The study speaks to the impact of terror induced PTSD on fetal development, the potential transmission of biological events associated with PTSD from mother to fetus, and environmental and genetic factors that may exacerbate fetal risk. The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1. Fetal health and behavior will be adversely affected by maternal PTSD. Hypothesis 1 asserts that fetuses of mothers exposed to terror and suffer from PTSD will show signs of poorer health (stunted fetal growth measures, atypical reactivity and regulation of heart rate and torso/limb movement to challenge, and complications) and poorer birth/neonatal parameters (birth weight, head circumference, gestational age at delivery, and complications) than women who were exposed to terror, but who do not develop PTSD. We also predict an association between posttraumatic stress symptoms and outcome measures, across the sample. Aim 2. Psychosocial stresses and maternal depression predict fetal health, behavior, and stress reactivity and regulation. Hypothesis 2 posits that, among women with PTSD, psychosocial stressors (life events, chronic stressors) and maternal depression will add significant risk to their fetus. Hypothesis 3 predicts that, in the full sample, psychosocial stress and maternal depression will moderate the effects of maternal PTSD. Aim 3. Analyses of candidate gene associations with fetal/neonatal outcomes. We will evaluate the association between offspring's genotype (indexed by a battery of candidate genes) and fetal/neonatal outcomes. Hypothesis 4 predicts that variants of these genes will have main effects on infant outcomes. Hypothesis 5 predicts we will find gene-environment interactions as follows: a) risk variants implicated in hypothesis 4 will moderate the impact that mothers' PTSD and mother's psychosocial stress each have on fetal/neonatal outcomes (i.e., we expect to observe gene-environment interactions).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PARAGRAPH: The violence outside the home, as experienced in some US communities (sporadic and frequent) can affect anyone near by. Information regarding the relation between exposure to violence and PTSD on fetal development and birth outcome is important for understanding the processes that can promote developmental risk in communities with such violence. In this regard, the distribution of adverse reproductive health outcomes in the US and other developed nations is characterized by large racial/ethic disparities (Anachebe 2003). In the US, an almost two-fold disparity persists in the rate of premature birth between African American and non-Hispanic White women, even after accounting for obstetric, socio demographic, and behavioral risk factors (Collins & Hammond 1996; MacDorman et al 2002); and it has been suggested that differences in risk may be related to variations in stress and stress physiology (Wadwa et al 2001). The results of the proposed study, which examines genetic and environmental risk in relation to fetal health, can further understanding of individual differences in psycho- neuroendocrine processes that underlie or contribute to the risk of pre maturity and adverse neurodevelopment, and both represent major public health issues in the US.          ",The Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma from Terror: A Developmental Perspec,7465029,R01HD053586,"['Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' indexing ', ' Israel ', ' Laboratories ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Head circumference ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Genetic ', ' Physiology ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Life ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' War ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' fetal ', ' psychosocial ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' limb movement ', ' stressor ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Fetal Growth ', ' intrauterine growth ', ' Measures ', ' Regulation ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Cities ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Trauma ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' infant outcome ', ' Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Fetus ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' ']",NICHD,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,457707,0.06002645186025938
"An Ethnographic Study of African-Caribbean Women with Schizophrenia in England    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is an ethnographic investigation of lived experiences of UK African-Caribbean women, with and without schizophrenia, to illuminate the socio-cultural mechanisms and processes that contribute to their high prevalence of the illness. Over the past twenty years, epidemiological studies have reported consistently that individuals of Caribbean origin in England have the highest rate of schizophrenia ever recorded anywhere ((Littlewood, 2001). Research data suggest that the increased rates of schizophrenia in this population are not due to genetic vulnerability or biological factors but to environmental stress and other social risk factors that are not yet fully understood. Using ethnographic research methods, the researcher will explore how UK African-Caribbeans' subjective experiences of their social worlds shape their sense of self, their emotional experiences, and the ways they experience and cope with stress. Building on existing epidemiological findings, she will conduct a micro-analysis of identified risk factors to better understand how they play out in individuals' daily life and generate specific hypotheses about how the social environment may lead to greater vulnerability to schizophrenia. She will also focus on African-Caribbean women, a population that is largely neglected in schizophrenia research in England. This ethnographic work will complement the epidemiological studies by providing the contextual and interpretative frameworks to analyze the experiences of African-Caribbeans in England and the various risks factors associated with schizophrenia in this population. It will contribute to an understanding of the role of socio-environmental factors in the development of schizophrenia and anthropological theories on the long-term impacts of immigration over the life course. It will also help to bring to fore the experiences of African-Caribbean women in schizophrenia and health disparity research. The findings of this study will advance our understanding of how the social environment contributes to the development and experience of schizophrenia. They will be immediately useful to mental health professionals and public policy makers, and will help to facilitate better intervention and treatment programs for schizophrenia. In addition, with an emphasis on second-generation UK African- Caribbean women with schizophrenia, this study will illuminate the long-term impacts of migration on the children of immigrants.          ",An Ethnographic Study of African-Caribbean Women with Schizophrenia in England,7489259,R36MH081727,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' London ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Immigrant ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Play ', ' Daily ', ' Shapes ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Policy ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Life ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' Investigation ', ' Walkers ', ' West Indies ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' British ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' social ', ' Generations ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' neglect ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' migration ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' emotional experience ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R36,2008,25134,0.04262238231570865
"Effects of Stress and Inflammatory Cytokines on Pregnancy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Poor pregnancy outcomes and complications such as low birthweight, preeclampsia, prematurity, and gestational diabetes continue to be a significant problem in the United States, particularly for women who are members of ethnic minorities. Psychosocial factors contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes, and proinflammatory aspects of the immune system may be involved in these effects. Although work in our laboratory and others supports connections between prenatal stress and poor outcome, the mechanisms of these relationships remain unclear. We hypothesize that that prenatal maternal stress and low social support increase levels of proinflammatory cytokines during pregnancy and that these changes increase the probability of poor pregnancy outcomes. The proposed R21 project extends our preliminary data, which suggests that high stress during pregnancy is related to elevated proinflammatory cytokines and poor outcome, perform comprehensive analyses of the effects of stress on cytokines during pregnancy, to add assessment of the role of social support in this relationship, and to determine the degree to which these changes can be used to make clinically useful predictions of at-risk pregnancies. An important aspect of this project is that we will study an ethnically diverse population (predominately Caucasian women and Latinas) which will extend the usefulness of the work in developing understanding of ethnic disparities in these relationships. This R21 project tests the hypothesis that high stress and low social support increase maternal production of proinflammatory cytokines during pregnancy (Specific Aim 1) and that this increased production is associated with pregnancy complications and poor outcome (Specific Aim 2). Further, a mathematical modeling approach is proposed to begin to determine the possible clinical usefulness of cytokine levels and stress in identifying pregnancies that are at risk for poor outcomes (Specific Aim 3). An additional aspect of the project is beginning to assess the role of maternal ethnicity in these interactions to explore biobehavioral factors that contribute to the disproportionate occurrence of pregnancy complications in minority women. It is clear that maternal stress can alter pregnancy outcome, although these effects are currently not well- understood. This project tests the hypothesis that high prenatal stress increases production of proinflammatory cytokines in pregnant women in a manner which contributes to poor pregnancy outcomes. We will use a prospective approach to assess stress, social support and cytokine production throughout pregnancy to see if these changes are predictive of poor outcome in a large, multi-ethnic sample.          ",Effects of Stress and Inflammatory Cytokines on Pregnancy,7611755,R21HD052544,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Address ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Rate ', ' Goals ', ' Peripheral ', ' Clinical ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Premature Labor ', ' Preterm Labor ', ' Premature Obstetric Labor ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lymphocyte ', ' lymph cell ', ' Lymphocytic ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Complications ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Probability ', ' Production ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' prenatal stress ', ' fetal stress ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' experience ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' member ', ' Prematurity of fetus ', ' premature fetus ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' cytokine ', ' Early identification ', ' Gestational Diabetes ', ' pregnancy diabetes ', ' Pregnancy-Induced Diabetes ', ' Gestational Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Sampling ', ' mathematical model ', ' mathematical modeling ', ' Math Models ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,R21,2008,210210,0.03918736991625329
"Under the Skin: Understanding the Role of Stress and Immune Function in Health Di    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and health is well established for many health outcomes and in many contexts. Despite the research attention being paid to health inequalities, the physical mechanisms linking SES and health are poorly understood. Lifelong exposure to infections and inflammation has been proposed as an important determinant of mortality. Little is known about the social patterning of multiple chronic infections or immune function in the U.S. population and how these factors may contribute to health disparities. Psychosocial stress has also been proposed as a potential pathway whereby lower SES can harm one's health. There is a large body of research describing a consistent link between psychosocial stress and susceptibility to infection, as well as reduced immune control over existing infections. However, the role that SES may play in immune function via its effects on psychosocial stress is unknown. This project will advance current research on the potential role of infection, immunity and stress in health disparities using several datasets with different strengths. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (including confidential mortality data), the Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA), the Chicago Community Adult Health Survey (CCAHS), and the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), we will first assess whether measures of SES are associated with the burden of chronic infection and immune response in the U.S population. Next, we will examine whether infectious burden and immune response mediate the relationship between SES and health outcomes such as mortality in the U.S. Finally, we will assess whether any relationships between SES and immune function are mediated by markers of psychosocial and economic stressors. We believe this work will fill important gaps in understanding the role that stress and the immune system might play in the interplay of social and biological risks that evolve over the life course to create disparities in disease and mortality. The results from this study may identify novel interventions for biological risk factors, such as the need for targeted vaccination or early treatment of common chronic infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study proposes to explore the contribution of stress and immune function to health disparities in the U.S. population. Using several population level surveys with both economic and biological data, we will test relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and the burden of chronic infection, as well as immune response to infection. We will test whether these immune and infection markers are related to psychosocial and economic stressors and whether they mediate the relationship between SES and health outcomes including mortality.          ",Under the Skin: Understanding the Role of Stress and Immune Function in Health Di,7498249,R21NR011181,"['Cytomegalovirus Infections ', ' Salivary Gland Virus Disease ', ' Inclusion Disease ', ' Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' immune function ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' allostatic load ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Aging ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Herpesviridae ', ' herpes virus ', ' Herpesviruses ', ' Herpesviridae Infections ', ' Herpesvirus Infections ', ' Herpesviridae disease ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Simplexvirus ', ' human herpesvirus 1 group ', ' Herpesvirus hominis ', ' Herpes labialis Virus ', ' Herpes Simplex Virus ', ' HSV ', ' Herpesvirus 1, Human ', ' human herpes virus 1 ', ' human alphaherpesvirus 1 ', ' herpes simplex i ', ' Human herpesvirus type 1 ', ' Human herpes simplex virus type 1 ', ' Herpesvirus 1 (alpha), Human ', ' Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 ', ' Herpes Simplex Virus 1 ', ' HSV1 ', ' HSV-1 ', ' HHV-1 ', ' Link ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Literature ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Play ', ' Antibodies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' stressor ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' cytokine ', ' Helicobacter pylori ', ' H.pylori ', ' H. pylory ', ' H. pylori ', ' Campylobacter pylori ', ' C. pylori ', ' Measures ', ' Chicago ', ' Porphyromonas gingivalis ', ' P.gingivalis ', ' P. gingivalis ', ' Bacteroides gingivalis ', ' Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ', ' Bacterium comitans ', ' Bacterium actinomycetem comitans ', ' A. actinomycetemcomitans ', ' Mortality Determinants ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' latent infection ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' ']",NINR,HUNTER COLLEGE,R21,2008,204364,0.06879776099376488
"Sex stress emotional disorders: uniting preclinical and epidemiologic research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advancing Novel Science in Women's Health Research (ANSWHR) We propose (1) to bring together researchers who have made important advances in preclinical, experimental, and epidemiological research on stress responsivity and psychopathology; (2) to integrate their findings across disciplines and identify key questions related to gender disparities; and (3) to plan a new program of research that takes a developmental approach to sex differences in stress responsivity as they affect depression and anxiety disorders in young people. The program of work has three aspects: (1) Two annual meetings of the workgroup members to identify key questions and plan a program of analysis of existing data sets. Meetings will be designed so that participants will learn as well as teach. At the second meeting, each work group member to commit to be first author on one or more specific papers. (2) A program of data analysis to be carried out at the Center for Developmental Epidemiology, Duke University. Analyses will be reported to the group by email; group members can request additional follow-up analyses. Monthly conference calls between meetings will discuss output of analyses and plan further work. (3) An application for an Interdisciplinary Developmental Science Center for Mental Health (IDSC) or similar mechanism, to be submitted in October 2010. Questions to be addressed include the following: 1. What has been learned from animal research about sex differences in the effects of early adversity on neurobiological parameters, such as the HPA axis, the autonomic nervous system, and neural systems implicated in psychopathology? 2. What has been learned from laboratory and epidemiological research with humans about sex differences in the effects of early adversity on neurobiological parameters, such as the HPA axis, the autonomic nervous system, and neural systems implicated in anxiety and depression in the first decades of life? 3. Where do these bodies of work agree, where do they conflict, and where are they most important gaps? We expect that the answers to questions 1 to 3 will lead to the planning of a Center application to focus on such questions as: 4. How does gender moderate the effects of childhood stress on mental health and neurobiological function; i.e., what are the interactions between stress response systems and sex steroids? 5. What are the sex-specific effects of stress and life events in different developmental stages or during transitions between stages (e.g., puberty) on risk for anxiety and depression? 6. How does the timing of differences in onset of anxiety and depression in males and females relate to sex differences in psychological and neurobiological functioning? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many psychiatric disorders occur more often in women than in men. Some have argued that this is because women suffer from a greater number of stressful events, or respond differently to stressors in their lives. This workgroup of world leaders in stress research will bring together the preclinical, experimental, and epidemiological evidence on stress, gender, and depression and anxiety disorders and plan a program of integrated research on gender disparities in the role played by stress in mental illness.                            ",Sex stress emotional disorders: uniting preclinical and

"Housing Stress and Wheeze/Asthma in Urban Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    This award aims to extend the candidate's growing expertise in socioeconomic dimensions in housing as it relates to health disparities focusing in particular on childhood asthma risk. The candidate completed a fellowship in academic pediatrics, earning an MPH from Boston University School of Public Health in epidemiology, biostatistics and environmental health. Further research training will occur under the supervision of a multi-disciplinary Advisory Committee with expertise in asthma, life stress, housing, allergens, immunology, and qualitative research. Career development will be enhanced through course work and participation in seminars and research on stress and housing factors. This award, along with the candidate's clinical and scientific background, will facilitate the development of a successful independent research career with a focus on the epidemiological study of the influence of both social and physical dimensions of housing conditions on childhood asthma morbidity in the inner city. While many epidemiological studies describe associations between poor housing and health (including asthma), none have considered the psychological dimension of housing quality either independently or in combination with physical housing characteristics as related to asthma risk. The investigators hypothesize that children exposed to higher level housing stress will be at greater risk for asthma/wheeze syndromes, independent of other life stressors (e.g., neighborhood disadvantage or violence) and exposures associated with poor housing (e.g., cockroach or rodent). Furthermore, they hypothesize higher-level housing stress, assessed annually in the first three years of life, will predict subsequent increased total IgE levels and allergen-specific lymphocyte proliferative response in the child at age 3 years controlled for these other risk factors.  Study of the relative importance of housing stress in urban populations may result in more targeted housing interventions and policy change to impact public health.

"RU: Daily Diary Evaluation of the Health Benefits of a Workplace Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has long suggested that a relationship exists between identifying as sexual minority (SM; e.g., gay males, lesbians, and bisexuals) and health concerns such as depression, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. Contemporary research with SM has sought to determine which processes mediate this relationship. Theorists have offered several potential mediators, but a consensus of which processes act as mediators does not exist among theorists. Meyer (2003) has offered the minority stress hypothesis as an explanatory model. His model posits that three mediation processes exist: prejudice events, stigma consciousness, and internalized homophobia. The proposed study seeks to test the minority stress hypothesis in a diverse sample of SM college males and females from the Pacific Northwest via the Internet. African American and Latino groups, though, often experience other factors that may have a negative effect on their mental health that are not included in the model (e.g., racist discrimination), which may make the model inappropriate for these individuals. The proposed study also seeks to test the minority stress hypothesis in a sample comprised entirely of SM African American and Latino college students. Should the model be inappropriate, a third model will be constructed that incorporates variables such as racist discrimination, family religiosity, and importance of being supported by one's family.          ",RU: Daily Diary Evaluation of the Health Benefits of a Workplace Intervention,7479122,F31HD054022,"['Demographic Factors ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Institution ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Range ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Family ', ' Support of Research ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fellowship ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' Bisexual ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Oregon ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Prejudice ', ' Daily ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Anxiety ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Stigmata ', ' Consensus ', ' diaries ', ' Victimization ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Washington ', ' Event ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Diamond ', ' experience ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Disease regression ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Family member ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' model design ', ' Communities ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2008,33940,0.04547124728083373
"Tools for Measuring and Analyzing Cortisol Levels in Population Studies of Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in health by socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity have been documented for numerous health outcomes. Developing a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons for health disparities that integrates factors defined at multiple levels (e.g. from community-level or neighborhood processes to biological factors) and that explicates common or interrelated processes that generate disparities in multiple health conditions remains a major challenge. This is important not only to understand the etiology of multiple diseases, but also to develop strategies to eliminate health disparities. One process that has been hypothesized to contribute to disparities in multiple health domains is psychosocial stress. It has been argued that exposure to psychosocial stressors repeatedly over long periods has biological consequences with implications for multiple health conditions, including outcomes as diverse as low birth weight, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. Two major challenges in studying the role of psychosocial stress include the (1) measurement and characterization of biological markers of the stress response (2) examining how this complex biological response varies as a function of higher-level (or upstream) determinants such as socioeconomic position and community characteristics. We propose to address both challenges through the development of methodological tools necessary to characterize and analyze biomarkers of the stress response (specifically cortisol profiles) in population-based studies. The overall goal of our project is to improve the methodological tools and data collection protocols necessary to understand how upstream determinants (such as neighborhood-level factors) trigger biological processes (specifically the stress response) that may generate disparities in multiple disease outcomes in the population. We will use a unique multilevel dataset to investigate the use of different methodological approaches in order to make specific recommendations regarding (a) data collection protocols for salivary cortisol data (specifically regarding number and timing of samples) and (b) data analyses involving cortisol profiles as outcomes or predictors The specific aims of our project are: (1) To investigate and contrast statistical methods useful in characterizing different features of the biological stress response, as assessed by repeat measures of salivary cortisol. (2) To examine measurement properties of the features of the cortisol curve in order to be able to make specific recommendations regarding the best data collection tools and protocols in future studies and (3) To investigate and contrast methods useful in examining how features of the stress response curve are related to neighborhood and individual-level predictors as well as to individual-level outcomes. Addressing these Aims will improve the tools available to researchers to study how communities and neighborhoods trigger biological processes in humans that relate to health disparities in the population (one of the stated aims of this RFA). Relevance Persistent and pronounced differences in health by race/ethnicity (often termed health disparities) and by socioeconomic position have been documented for many different health outcomes. The reasons for these disparities remain a subject for research. Psychosocial factors have been hypothesized to be important contributors to these disparities but the tools available to characterize and analyze the biologic consequences of psychosocial stress remain limited. By developing tools necessary to measure and analyze biologic markers of the stress response, our project will contribute to the study for the reasons for health disparities in multiple health outcomes.

"Stress, Lead, Iron Deficiency and Neurodevelopment Social stressors, iron deficiency anemia, and lead exposure are all environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopment in young children. All three factors are highly prevalent in poor communities, whether in Mexico or the U.S. There are scant human epidemiologic studies on chronic social stress and human neurodevelopment. In addition, previous studies of child development and neurotoxicants have typically analyzed covariate markers of social stress as independent predictors of neurodevelopment; and thus, only considered social factors as potential confounders in their data analysis. There are biological reasons to believe that stress potentiates the toxicity of iron deficiency anemia and lead poisoning. If so, then understanding this relationship may be the key to designing effective public health interventions designed to improve neurodevelopment and may explain the lack of effectiveness of prevention/treatment regimens for lead poisoning and iron deficiency. A prospective cohort study with a large sample size is needed to address the potential multiplicative effects of combined stress/iron deficiency anemia and combined stress/lead exposure in predicting infant development.  This resubmission includes new data from a pilot study of stress-lead/stress-anemia interactions in 120 mother infant pairs conducted since the prior application, which demonstrates study feasibility and evidence for the hypothesized interactions. In this proposal we will measure maternal stress levels, infant iron deficiency anemia and lead exposure in a cohort of mother-infant pairs living in Mexico City and longitudinally measure maternal stress, iron stores, lead exposure, salivary cortisol and neurodevelopment beginning pre-natally and extending 3 years post-partum. This project will determine the independent effect of pre- and post-partum maternal stress in predicting infant development, and the multiplicative joint effects of maternal stress/iron deficiency and maternal stress/lead poisoning in predicting infant development.

"Cells to Society (C2s): The Center on Social Disparities and Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The three signature themes guiding our research are: social disparities, stress, and health; families, interpersonal relationships, and health; and developmental perspectives on health disparities from conception through adulthood. The goals of our proposed activities are to: (i) become an international locus for information about and training in the use of biomarkers in population research; (ii) expand and strengthen our signature programs of population research; (iii) initiate new types of interdisciplinary, collaborative research projects that span the social and life sciences; (iv) mentor and develop young scientists; (v) increase external funding; and (vi) translate research findings for practice and policy. With regard to biomarkers, C2S faculty would expand their work on development of ""field-friendly"" methods for assessing biomarkers of human health and development. Key goals are to develop methods for assaying new biomarkers, provide technical assistance for incorporating these methods into national and community surveys, and, through an annual summer workshop, train students and faculty in using and analyzing biomarker data in population surveys. With regard to new research activities, our focus in social disparities and health include cross-national studies of stress and culture, studies of racial and ethnic disparities in the U.S., biologically-based studies of stress and psychological health, and studies of stress and socioeconomic elements of both families and neighborhoods. Our focus on interpersonal relationships and health includes studies of family stress and child well-being, and prejudice and stereotyping in inter-group relations. Our focus on developmental perspectives on health include studies of how prenatal and neo-natal environments affect child well-being and adult health, and developmental influences on adult reproductive function. Consistent throughout our proposed work is the emphasis on population-level health and well-being through the use, where possible, of representative samples from target populations of interest. Our research-based mentoring and curriculum-based instruction will train a new cadre of young researchers whose mastery of both biological and population-based methods will equip them to engage in the kind of integrative, multi- method, interdisciplinary approaches to population health research envisioned by the NIH Roadmap.

"Stress, Environment, and Genetics in Urban Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal is to examine the role of psychosocial stressors in a systems biology framework considering multiple biologic pathways by which stress can contribute to asthma causation. We will not only study the independent effect of stress on asthma/wheeze phenotypes in early childhood but also will consider stress as a modifier of physical environmental factors (allergens, cigarette smoking and diesel-related air pollutants) and genetic predisposition on asthma risk. We will determine the independent effect of maternal stress (both prenatal and postnatal) on early childhood asthma phenotypes. We further hypothesize that multi-life stressors prevalent in disadvantaged populations can cumulatively influence immune system development and airway inflammation in early life, thus making the populations more susceptible to other environmental factors and genetic risk factors explaining, in part, observed asthma disparities associated with SES and race/ethnicity. We will take a multi-level approach, measuring both individual-level stress (negative life events, perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety) and community-level stress [neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., percent of subjects living in poverty, percent unemployed), diminished social capital, and high crime/violence rates]. We will also assess the influence of stress on the infant hormonal stress response and on T-helper cell differentiation as reflected in cytokine profiles and IgE expression (a topic or pro inflammatory phenotype). Additional physical environmental (indoor allergens, diesel-related air pollutants, tobacco smoke) and genetic factors will be assessed given their influence on the immune response and expression of early childhood asthma/wheeze. This interdisciplinary approach is unique because we are considering the context in which physical exposures and host susceptibility occurs, analyzing their multiplicative joint effects and considering multiple biologic pathways, as such it is consistent with the NIH roadmap objectives.

"Social Influences on Early Adult Stress Biomarkers The goal of our project is to conduct a population-level investigation of social contexts, stress, and health. We integrate multiple biomarkers of stress with current theory and measurement tools from the social and behavioral sciences to gain a better understanding of how social contexts ""get under the skin"" to affect stress and health in young adults. We use data from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) in pursuit of three objectives: 1) Examine the interrelations among multiple subjective and physiological measures of stress; 2) Investigate how measures of socio-economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships in childhood/adolescence and over the transition to adulthood influence stress in early adulthood; and 3) Test competing theoretical models of the joint influence of socio- economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships on stress. We examine subjective measures of stress, including perceived stress, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of anxiety, as well as physiological measures of endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and inflammatory activity. We take advantage of the breadth and depth of the Add Health dataset to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date of how social stress affects physical and mental health. Additionally, the large sample size and racial, ethnic, and economic diversity of Add Health allow us to investigate the extent to which stress leads to health disparities. Stress is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, and investigating the physiological mechanisms through which social contexts affect human health can help investigators, clinicians, and policy makers to: a) identify adverse psychosocial environments; b) better understand predisease and disease pathways; and c) inform interventions to reduce exposure to stressors, reduce the adverse impact of stressors on physiology, and prevent the emergence of stress-related disorders.

"Race/Ethnicity, Psychosocial and Environmental Stressors, and Telomere Length    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to conduct the first community-based study of racial differences in telomere length and allostatic load in adults of broad age range and their association with urban stressors. We hypothesize that chronic stressors experienced by black urban residents accelerate biological aging and chronic disease onset. Evidence suggests that leukocyte telomere length (TL) may be an indicator of biological age that can be affected by stress; and that allostatic load is an indicator of stress-mediated wear on important body systems. We have a unique opportunity to supplement survey data scheduled to be collected by the Healthy Environments Partnership (HEP) a partnership between the University of Michigan and community-based organizations and health service agencies in Detroit with blood collection and lab analyses of telomere length, telomere-related compounds, and allostatic load, including measures of the biological stress response, inflammation, and cardiovascular and metabolic risk. By appending a venous blood draw to the HEP survey, we can construct a data set including these biomeasures and detailed psychosocial and physical environmental measures in a cost-effective way; enhance access to a hard-to-reach population; and facilitate dissemination of study results to improve community health. We will estimate a series of regressions of TL and allostatic load on race, controlling for the confounding effects of age, gender, and socioeconomic characteristics and exploring the extent to which psychosocial or environmental stressors mediate remaining racial differences. To ensure findings are not driven by functional form we will reanalyze the data using matching methods. We will also model disease outcomes, conditional on telomere length, on high oxidative stress or low telomerase activity to explore biological mechanistic pathways between telomere length and chronic disease. Our investigative team brings exceptional expertise in social and behavioral science, cell biology, psychology and biochemistry to insure state-of-the art telomere measurement, theory-driven and statistically sound social science measures and models, and appropriate interpretation of study findings to provide important insights. We expect study findings to shed light on the plausibility of cumulative stress hypotheses to explain the social patterning of disease; the viability of telomere length as a biomeasure of aging; and the mechanistic pathways through which stressors may be linked to telomere length and disease processes. If findings from this interdisciplinary collaborative effort support study hypotheses, this could constitute a significant advance in the understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie racial inequality in health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Learning how social factors work through biological mechanisms to impact health is fundamental to understanding racial health disparities. By studying personal and neighborhood stressors and the health of Detroit residents in an interdisciplinary collaboration, we hope to shed light on this question.                   ","Race/Ethnicity, Psychosocial and Environmental Stressors, and Telomere Length",7522172,R01AG032632,"['Work ', ' Pattern ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Deterioration ', ' Schedule ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Telomerase ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' illness length ', ' disease length ', ' disease duration ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Communities ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' age effect ', ' aging effect ', ' cost ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' Weather ', ' Woman ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Gender ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Differential Mortality ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Environment ', ' Length ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol (17beta)- ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Biochemistry and Cellular Biology ', ' Data ', ' Range ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' Collection ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' allostatic load ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' concept ', ' urban poverty area ', ' Aging ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Depth ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ensure ', ' Learning ', ' insight ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Nerve ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Onset of illness ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Collaborations ', ' Historical Survey ', ' Metabolic ', ' Physiology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Venous ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' sound ', ' Arts ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Universities ', ' Vitamin E ', ' stressor ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' hypothalamic pituitary axis ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Population Study ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Disease regression ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' social ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2008,435890,0.0818827551911081
"Under the Skin: Understanding the Role of Stress and Immune Function in Health Di    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and health is well established for many health outcomes and in many contexts. Despite the research attention being paid to health inequalities, the physical mechanisms linking SES and health are poorly understood. Lifelong exposure to infections and inflammation has been proposed as an important determinant of mortality. Little is known about the social patterning of multiple chronic infections or immune function in the U.S. population and how these factors may contribute to health disparities. Psychosocial stress has also been proposed as a potential pathway whereby lower SES can harm one's health. There is a large body of research describing a consistent link between psychosocial stress and susceptibility to infection, as well as reduced immune control over existing infections. However, the role that SES may play in immune function via its effects on psychosocial stress is unknown. This project will advance current research on the potential role of infection, immunity and stress in health disparities using several datasets with different strengths. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (including confidential mortality data), the Sacramento Area Latino Study of Aging (SALSA), the Chicago Community Adult Health Survey (CCAHS), and the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS), we will first assess whether measures of SES are associated with the burden of chronic infection and immune response in the U.S population. Next, we will examine whether infectious burden and immune response mediate the relationship between SES and health outcomes such as mortality in the U.S. Finally, we will assess whether any relationships between SES and immune function are mediated by markers of psychosocial and economic stressors. We believe this work will fill important gaps in understanding the role that stress and the immune system might play in the interplay of social and biological risks that evolve over the life course to create disparities in disease and mortality. The results from this study may identify novel interventions for biological risk factors, such as the need for targeted vaccination or early treatment of common chronic infections. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study proposes to explore the contribution of stress and immune function to health disparities in the U.S. population. Using several population level surveys with both economic and biological data, we will test relationships between socioeconomic status (SES) and the burden of chronic infection, as well as immune response to infection. We will test whether these immune and infection markers are related to psychosocial and economic stressors and whether they mediate the relationship between SES and health outcomes including mortality.          ",Under the Skin: Understanding the Role of Stress and Immune Function in Health Di,7690352,R21NR011181,"['Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Immune ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' stressor ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' cytokine ', ' Helicobacter pylori ', ' H.pylori ', ' H. pylory ', ' H. pylori ', ' Campylobacter pylori ', ' C. pylori ', ' Measures ', ' Chicago ', ' Porphyromonas gingivalis ', ' P.gingivalis ', ' P. gingivalis ', ' Bacteroides gingivalis ', ' Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ', ' Bacterium comitans ', ' Bacterium actinomycetem comitans ', ' A. actinomycetemcomitans ', ' Mortality Determinants ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' latent infection ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' pathogen ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Early treatment ', ' early therapy ', ' early intervention ', ' public health relevance ', ' health inequalities ', ' Cytomegalovirus Infections ', ' Salivary Gland Virus Disease ', ' Inclusion Disease ', ' Cytomegalic Inclusion Disease ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' immune function ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Data ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' allostatic load ', ' Age ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Health ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Herpesviridae ', ' herpes virus ', ' Herpesviruses ', ' Herpesviridae Infections ', ' Herpesvirus Infections ', ' Herpesviridae disease ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Herpesvirus 1, Human ', ' human herpes virus 1 ', ' human alphaherpesvirus 1 ', ' herpes simplex i ', ' Human herpesvirus type 1 ', ' Human herpes simplex virus type 1 ', ' Herpesvirus 1 (alpha), Human ', ' Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 ', ' Herpes Simplex Virus 1 ', ' HSV1 ', ' HSV-1 ', ' HHV-1 ', ' Link ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunity ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' nonhuman primate ', ' non-human primate ', ' Literature ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Immune response ', ' immunoresponse ', ' host response ', ' Play ', ' Antibodies ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Vaccination ', ' ']",NINR,HUNTER COLLEGE,R21,2009,229415,0.06879776099376488
"Minority stress among sexual minority women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    The most prevalent mental disorders afflicting women are anxiety and affective disorders, while common health risk behaviors include alcohol and drug use, smoking, and obesity-related behaviors. Sexual minority women (SMW; lesbians, bisexual women, and other women who partner with women), who constitute an estimated 4-5% of the U.S. population of women, are at particular risk for these adverse outcomes. For example, SMW are up to three times more likely to experience depression, up to two times more likely to smoke, and up to three times more likely to be overweight compared to their heterosexual counterparts. Indeed, this population has been acknowledged as at risk for health disparities in Healthy People 2010. Researchers have hypothesized that the elevated rates of mental disorders and health risk behaviors among SMW are linked to the individual and cultural oppression experienced by this population. However, this ""minority stress"" hypothesis has not been adequately examined in empirical studies of women, in part due to the lack of a gender-sensitive model and instrument to assess SMW's specific concerns. Research on the impact and nature of minority stressors in this population is desperately needed in order to design prevention interventions. To this end, the proposed mixed-methods study will examine associations among minority stress and health outcomes of SMW. Specifically, the qualitative phase will use three focus groups of 24 SMW to provide a description of the novel category ""gender expression"" and explore its relation to health outcomes and who may be at greatest risk. The quantitative phase will investigate a theoretical model of the effects of gender expression and minority stressors on the outcomes of mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety) and health risk behaviors (i.e., alcohol and drug use, smoking, obesity-related behaviors). Minority stressors we will study include bias-related victimization, stigma consciousness, concealment, internalized homophobia, and internalized sexism. Quantitative data will be collected in a national web-based survey of 200 ethnically diverse SMW. The applicant, who is a top student at a highly ranked clinical psychology program, has outlined an extensive and detailed research plan for the project. Moreover, she has assembled a team of experts in this area who are well situated to mentor her and assist in achieving the project goals.  Project Narrative  This project has direct relevance to public health because it examines the mechanisms leading to serious mental health problems and health risk behaviors known to lead to disease among sexual minority women, a vulnerable and understudied population. Understanding which factors contribute to adverse health outcomes and how to target those most at risk will help inform preventions and interventions targeting these individuals and, ultimately, improve their well-being.",Minority stress among sexual minority women,7670140,R36CD000996,[''],ODCDC,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R36,2009,37725,0.01597667452646332
"MINORITY PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Research has long suggested that a relationship exists between identifying as sexual minority (SM; e.g., gay males, lesbians, and bisexuals) and health concerns such as depression, suicidal ideation, and substance abuse. Contemporary research with SM has sought to determine which processes mediate this relationship. Theorists have offered several potential mediators, but a consensus of which processes act as mediators does not exist among theorists. Meyer (2003) has offered the minority stress hypothesis as an explanatory model. His model posits that three mediation processes exist: prejudice events, stigma consciousness, and internalized homophobia. The proposed study seeks to test the minority stress hypothesis in a diverse sample of SM college males and females from the Pacific Northwest via the Internet. African American and Latino groups, though, often experience other factors that may have a negative effect on their mental health that are not included in the model (e.g., racist discrimination), which may make the model inappropriate for these individuals. The proposed study also seeks to test the minority stress hypothesis in a sample comprised entirely of SM African American and Latino college students. Should the model be inappropriate, a third model will be constructed that incorporates variables such as racist discrimination, family religiosity, and importance of being supported by one's family.          ",MINORITY PREDOCTORAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM,7667274,F31HD054022,"['statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Suicide ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Universities ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Washington ', ' Event ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Diamond ', ' experience ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Addictive Behavior ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Family member ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' model design ', ' Communities ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' depression ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Institution ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Fellowship Program ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Fellowship ', ' Adolescence ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Foundations ', ' Age ', ' Bisexual ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Oregon ', ' Pacific Northwest ', ' Prejudice ', ' Clinical Psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Anxiety ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Safety ', ' Stigmata ', ' Consensus ', ' Victimization ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,F31,2009,33940,0.04593714504417929
"Cells to Society (C2s): The Center on Social Disparities and Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The three signature themes guiding our research are: social disparities, stress, and health; families, interpersonal relationships, and health; and developmental perspectives on health disparities from conception through adulthood. The goals of our proposed activities are to: (i) become an international locus for information about and training in the use of biomarkers in population research; (ii) expand and strengthen our signature programs of population research; (iii) initiate new types of interdisciplinary, collaborative research projects that span the social and life sciences; (iv) mentor and develop young scientists; (v) increase external funding; and (vi) translate research findings for practice and policy. With regard to biomarkers, C2S faculty would expand their work on development of ""field-friendly"" methods for assessing biomarkers of human health and development. Key goals are to develop methods for assaying new biomarkers, provide technical assistance for incorporating these methods into national and community surveys, and, through an annual summer workshop, train students and faculty in using and analyzing biomarker data in population surveys. With regard to new research activities, our focus in social disparities and health include cross-national studies of stress and culture, studies of racial and ethnic disparities in the U.S., biologically-based studies of stress and psychological health, and studies of stress and socioeconomic elements of both families and neighborhoods. Our focus on interpersonal relationships and health includes studies of family stress and child well-being, and prejudice and stereotyping in inter-group relations. Our focus on developmental perspectives on health include studies of how prenatal and neo-natal environments affect child well-being and adult health, and developmental influences on adult reproductive function. Consistent throughout our proposed work is the emphasis on population-level health and well-being through the use, where possible, of representative samples from target populations of interest. Our research-based mentoring and curriculum-based instruction will train a new cadre of young researchers whose mastery of both biological and population-based methods will equip them to engage in the kind of integrative, multi- method, interdisciplinary approaches to population health research envisioned by the NIH Roadmap.

"The Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma from Terror: A Developmental Perspec    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed work addresses a key goal of NIMH Program Announcement PA-07-312, which seeks to enhance scientific understanding about the etiology of psychopathology related to violence and trauma"". The almost 4000 missiles that fell within Northern Israel in the summer of 2006, the damage suffered by property and persons, and the confinement of many families in bomb shelters during the terror period created a unique 'naturalistic' laboratory for assessing the effects of PTSD caused by exposure to a circumscribed period of terror. Within this context, we will examine the health and behavior of fetuses and birth parameters of pregnant women who were residents of the North at the time of the war and test for gene and environmental moderation of fetal and birth measures. We will study two groups: (1) 150 women who are residents of cities attacked during the ""war"" and who meet full criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of their exposure to attacks, and (2) 150 women from the same cohort, who show no symptoms of PTSD. The study will be the first study to examine fetal health and behavior in pregnant women with PTSD and the first study to test for gene-based vulnerabilities and Gene x Environment on these measures. The study speaks to the impact of terror induced PTSD on fetal development, the potential transmission of biological events associated with PTSD from mother to fetus, and environmental and genetic factors that may exacerbate fetal risk. The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1. Fetal health and behavior will be adversely affected by maternal PTSD. Hypothesis 1 asserts that fetuses of mothers exposed to terror and suffer from PTSD will show signs of poorer health (stunted fetal growth measures, atypical reactivity and regulation of heart rate and torso/limb movement to challenge, and complications) and poorer birth/neonatal parameters (birth weight, head circumference, gestational age at delivery, and complications) than women who were exposed to terror, but who do not develop PTSD. We also predict an association between posttraumatic stress symptoms and outcome measures, across the sample. Aim 2. Psychosocial stresses and maternal depression predict fetal health, behavior, and stress reactivity and regulation. Hypothesis 2 posits that, among women with PTSD, psychosocial stressors (life events, chronic stressors) and maternal depression will add significant risk to their fetus. Hypothesis 3 predicts that, in the full sample, psychosocial stress and maternal depression will moderate the effects of maternal PTSD. Aim 3. Analyses of candidate gene associations with fetal/neonatal outcomes. We will evaluate the association between offspring's genotype (indexed by a battery of candidate genes) and fetal/neonatal outcomes. Hypothesis 4 predicts that variants of these genes will have main effects on infant outcomes. Hypothesis 5 predicts we will find gene-environment interactions as follows: a) risk variants implicated in hypothesis 4 will moderate the impact that mothers' PTSD and mother's psychosocial stress each have on fetal/neonatal outcomes (i.e., we expect to observe gene-environment interactions).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PARAGRAPH: The violence outside the home, as experienced in some US communities (sporadic and frequent) can affect anyone near by. Information regarding the relation between exposure to violence and PTSD on fetal development and birth outcome is important for understanding the processes that can promote developmental risk in communities with such violence. In this regard, the distribution of adverse reproductive health outcomes in the US and other developed nations is characterized by large racial/ethic disparities (Anachebe 2003). In the US, an almost two-fold disparity persists in the rate of premature birth between African American and non-Hispanic White women, even after accounting for obstetric, socio demographic, and behavioral risk factors (Collins & Hammond 1996; MacDorman et al 2002); and it has been suggested that differences in risk may be related to variations in stress and stress physiology (Wadwa et al 2001). The results of the proposed study, which examines genetic and environmental risk in relation to fetal health, can further understanding of individual differences in psycho- neuroendocrine processes that underlie or contribute to the risk of pre maturity and adverse neurodevelopment, and both represent major public health issues in the US.          ",The Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma from Terror: A Developmental Perspec,7686288,R01HD053586,"['Developing Countries ', ' Under-Developed Nations ', ' Under-Developed Countries ', ' Third-World Nations ', ' Third-World Countries ', ' Less-Developed Nations ', ' Less-Developed Countries ', ' Developing Nations ', ' Developing Nation ', ' Developing Country ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Fetus ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' indexing ', ' Israel ', ' Laboratories ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Head circumference ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Genetic ', ' Physiology ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Life ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' War ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' fetal ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' limb movement ', ' stressor ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' offspring ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Fetal Growth ', ' intrauterine growth ', ' Measures ', ' Regulation ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Cities ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Trauma ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' infant outcome ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,383340,0.06002645186025938
"Stress, Environment, and Genetics in Urban Asthma DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal is to examine the role of psychosocial stressors in a systems biology framework considering multiple biologic pathways by which stress can contribute to asthma causation. We will not only study the independent effect of stress on asthma/wheeze phenotypes in early childhood but also will consider stress as a modifier of physical environmental factors (allergens, cigarette smoking and diesel-related air pollutants) and genetic predisposition on asthma risk. We will determine the independent effect of maternal stress (both prenatal and postnatal) on early childhood asthma phenotypes. We further hypothesize that multi-life stressors prevalent in disadvantaged populations can cumulatively influence immune system development and airway inflammation in early life, thus making the populations more susceptible to other environmental factors and genetic risk factors explaining, in part, observed asthma disparities associated with SES and race/ethnicity. We will take a multi-level approach, measuring both individual-level stress (negative life events, perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety) and community-level stress [neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., percent of subjects living in poverty, percent unemployed), diminished social capital, and high crime/violence rates]. We will also assess the influence of stress on the infant hormonal stress response and on T-helper cell differentiation as reflected in cytokine profiles and IgE expression (a topic or pro inflammatory phenotype). Additional physical environmental (indoor allergens, diesel-related air pollutants, tobacco smoke) and genetic factors will be assessed given their influence on the immune response and expression of early childhood asthma/wheeze. This interdisciplinary approach is unique because we are considering the context in which physical exposures and host susceptibility occurs, analyzing their multiplicative joint effects and considering multiple biologic pathways, as such it is consistent with the NIH roadmap objectives.

"Impact of Omega-3 Intake During Pregnancy on Maternal Stress and Infant Outcome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnant women living in poverty often experience chronic stress, and consequently higher levels of stress hormones. In utero exposure to high levels of stress hormones can negatively affect the developing fetus and later, the infant's capacity for emotion and behavioral regulation. In this proposal we describe a developing program of research designed to reduce the negative impact of prenatal stress on infant health and development via nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy. DHA is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member of the omega-3 fatty acid family. DHA is found in its highest concentrations in neural cell membranes, affecting receptor function, neurotransmitter uptake, and signal transmission. There is growing evidence that low levels of dietary DHA intake are associated with suboptimal response to stress and that DHA supplementation can modulate stress response. Aims: The goals of the proposed study are to explore whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy is associated with 1) a reduction in maternal perceived stress during pregnancy; 2) a more modulated maternal cortisol response to a stress stimulus during pregnancy, and 3) more optimal regulation of emotion and behavior in the infant. Approach: Sixty-five pregnant women living in inner-city poverty, who consume less than two servings of fish per week, will be randomly assigned to receive 450 mg/daily of DHA or placebo beginning at 16-20 weeks gestation through the end of pregnancy. Perceived stress, pregnancy related stress, stressful life events, anxiety, and depression will be assessed at baseline and at 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy and at 4 months post-partum. DHA levels will be assessed at baseline and at 36 weeks of pregnancy. Cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test will be measured at baseline, 24, and 30 weeks. At 4 months post-partum infant temperament, cognitive development and stress reactivity will be assessed in the laboratory. Investigators: This proposal stems from an NIMH R21 Translational Science Network on prenatal stress and mental health outcomes in the offspring. Three members of that network, Drs. Keenan, Carter, and Glover, are all funded investigators in the area of prenatal stress and child mental health, which is a prioritized area of exploratory research that could directly impact clinical care. They are collaborating on the present application. Innovation: This will be the first randomized controlled study of the effect of DHA supplementation on stress response in pregnant women living in inner-city poverty, and the first study of maternal DHA supplementation on emotion and stress regulation in their infants. Relevance: If DHA supplementation is associated with reductions in perceived stress, more modulated maternal cortisol response to stress, and more optimal emotional and behavioral regulation in the infant, even within the context inner-city poverty, then a comprehensive program of research on the mechanisms by which these associations evolve and the potential for broad-based prevention of poor developmental outcomes among children born to women living in poverty can be launched. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This will be the first study of the effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in pregnant women living in inner-city poverty on the stress response system during pregnancy. If essential fatty acid supplementation is associated with reductions in the experience of stress, more modulated hormonal response to stress, and more optimal regulation of emotion and attention in the infant, even within the context inner-city poverty, then a comprehensive program of research on the role of nutrition on stress during pregnancy can be launched. This study may be the first step toward broad-based prevention of poor developmental outcomes among children born to women living in poverty.            Project Narrative This will be the first study of the effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in pregnant women living in inner-city poverty on the stress response system during pregnancy.

"Tools for Measuring and Analyzing Cortisol Levels in Population Studies of Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in health by socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity have been documented for numerous health outcomes. Developing a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons for health disparities that integrates factors defined at multiple levels (e.g. from community-level or neighborhood processes to biological factors) and that explicates common or interrelated processes that generate disparities in multiple health conditions remains a major challenge. This is important not only to understand the etiology of multiple diseases, but also to develop strategies to eliminate health disparities. One process that has been hypothesized to contribute to disparities in multiple health domains is psychosocial stress. It has been argued that exposure to psychosocial stressors repeatedly over long periods has biological consequences with implications for multiple health conditions, including outcomes as diverse as low birth weight, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. Two major challenges in studying the role of psychosocial stress include the (1) measurement and characterization of biological markers of the stress response (2) examining how this complex biological response varies as a function of higher-level (or upstream) determinants such as socioeconomic position and community characteristics. We propose to address both challenges through the development of methodological tools necessary to characterize and analyze biomarkers of the stress response (specifically cortisol profiles) in population-based studies. The overall goal of our project is to improve the methodological tools and data collection protocols necessary to understand how upstream determinants (such as neighborhood-level factors) trigger biological processes (specifically the stress response) that may generate disparities in multiple disease outcomes in the population. We will use a unique multilevel dataset to investigate the use of different methodological approaches in order to make specific recommendations regarding (a) data collection protocols for salivary cortisol data (specifically regarding number and timing of samples) and (b) data analyses involving cortisol profiles as outcomes or predictors The specific aims of our project are: (1) To investigate and contrast statistical methods useful in characterizing different features of the biological stress response, as assessed by repeat measures of salivary cortisol. (2) To examine measurement properties of the features of the cortisol curve in order to be able to make specific recommendations regarding the best data collection tools and protocols in future studies and (3) To investigate and contrast methods useful in examining how features of the stress response curve are related to neighborhood and individual-level predictors as well as to individual-level outcomes. Addressing these Aims will improve the tools available to researchers to study how communities and neighborhoods trigger biological processes in humans that relate to health disparities in the population (one of the stated aims of this RFA). Relevance Persistent and pronounced differences in health by race/ethnicity (often termed health disparities) and by socioeconomic position have been documented for many different health outcomes. The reasons for these disparities remain a subject for research. Psychosocial factors have been hypothesized to be important contributors to these disparities but the tools available to characterize and analyze the biologic consequences of psychosocial stress remain limited. By developing tools necessary to measure and analyze biologic markers of the stress response, our project will contribute to the study for the reasons for health disparities in multiple health outcomes.

"RCT of Stress Reduction in the Secondary Prevention of CHD in African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad Challenge Area is: 09 Health Disparities. The specific Challenge Topic is: Develop tools to detect early indicators of health disparities, and to test collaborative interventions to reduce differential health care or outcomes for heart, lung, and blood diseases: 09-HL-101. The mortality rate from cardiovascular disease is twice as high in African Americans as white Americans. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of this health disparity since mortality rates from CHD are 50 percent greater in African American men and women compared to whites. Epidemiological evidence implicates excessive psychosocial and socio-environmental stress in these disproportionate rates of CHD mortality and morbidity. Despite these public health patterns, there have been no previous clinical trials to assess the efficacy of stress reduction training added to standard secondary prevention programs for CHD in high risk African Americans. Previous controlled clinical studies have demonstrated that stress reduction with the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program is associated with reductions in CHD risk factors, surrogate CHD endpoints and clinical cardiovascular events in African American men and women. These beneficial changes include reductions in hypertension, psychosocial stress, insulin resistance-metabolic syndrome, myocardial ischemia, carotid atherosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and mortality rates. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive and specific noninvasive tool for quantifying changes in coronary artery disease. A preliminary study using cardiac PET in African American subjects with CHD demonstrated the feasibility of using this technology in a phase II trial to determine the efficacy of stress reduction in patients with CHD. Therefore, the overall objective of the present study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation with and without a structured, standardized, and validated stress reduction component in the secondary prevention of CHD in African Americans. In this phase II trial, 56 African American men and women with established CHD will be randomly allocated either to standard cardiac rehabilitation with formal stress reduction training using the Transcendental Meditation program or to standard cardiac rehabilitation alone. The intervention period will be 12 weeks. At baseline and posttest, subjects will be tested by quantitative PET for myocardial perfusion and ischemia. Secondary outcomes comprise physiological, behavioral and psychosocial risk factors for CHD. Participant eligibility criteria and programmatic elements of the intervention programs are consistent with Medicare guidelines for phase II cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention. The field site will be Columbia University Medical Center and the coordinating center will be MUMRI-Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention. This study will be the first of its kind to directly evaluate the contributions of stress reduction training to the secondary prevention of CHD in African American men and women with documented heart disease. African Americans suffer from two-fold higher rates of mortality from cardiovascular disease compared to the majority population. Substantial evidence indicates that disproportionately high levels of psychosocial and environmental stress contribute to this public health disparity. This will be the first clinical trial to evaluate the usefulness of stress reduction combined with standard cardiac care compared to standard cardiac care alone in modifying the heart disease process in African American men and women with known coronary heart disease.                    Project Narrative African Americans suffer from two-fold higher rates of mortality from cardiovascular disease compared to the majority population.

"Mindfulness skills training: An innovative approach to stress reduction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a feasibility study to develop and test an innovative program for stress management, delivered with new technology, among low socioeconomic status (SES) workers at risk for chronic stress and poor health outcomes. Chronic stress over-activates adaptive stress responses, dysregulates self-regulatory mechanisms, and diverts resources away from health maintenance functions, resulting in higher rates of illness and early death. Greater than 1/2 of U.S. workers report high levels of job-related stress (e.g., high job-related demands & low wages). Nurse aides (NAs) in long-term care, with high job-related demands and low wages, provide one excellent example of low (SES) workers at risk for chronic stress and poor health outcomes. Workplace stress management has been named as a national priority. But, existing programs are diverse and have not consistently improved outcomes. Researchers have yet to identify evidence-based practices for effective stress management. Research supports the efficacy of a) mindfulness interventions on health-related outcomes and b) behavioral and informational interventions delivered by technology to low-income populations. Based on self-regulation theory, the proposed mindfulness skills training (MST) intervention is an innovative approach to stress management for workers. This is because it will increase accessibility and affordability of the intervention among low SES workers like (NAs) by delivery via new technology (i.e., MP3 players). Measures of perceived stress, coping behaviors, and signs and symptoms will be measured pre- and post-intervention, and at 1 month follow-up. My hypotheses are: Mindfulness will be correlated with 1) perceived stress, 2) physical symptoms, and 3) physiological signs of stress (e.g., BP). These scores will also be associated with changes in moods (greater positive, less negative) and coping behaviors (greater acceptance, less avoidance). The purposes of this study are to: 1) Evaluate the feasibility of the MST program delivered to NAs in a long-term care setting and 2) Explore the relationship of mindfulness (e.g., attention and awareness) to perceived stress and psychological, physical, behavioral and physiological responses to stress. Consistent with the NINR mission, this proposed study promises to develop and test an innovative bio-behavioral self-management intervention delivered via new technology. Findings will be to refine a future intervention, related measures, and in the design of a randomized controlled trial for low SES workers. For public: MST is one creative approach for managing stress more effectively that could be especially relevant to low SES workers and could improve their health outcomes.          ",Mindfulness skills training: An innovative approach to stress reduction,7752296,F31NR010986,"['response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Policies ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Names ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', "" Nurses' Aides "", ' Nursing Auxiliaries ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Smoking ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Awareness ', ' Endocrine ', ' skills training ', ' Agreement ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Self Management ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2009,31370,0.16756221533570614
"Immunologic Effects and a Structural ""Countermarketing"" Intervention: Racism, the    DESCRIPTION (Provided by the applicant)   Abstract:  The overall aims of this project are to explore the effects of multiple levels of racism on the immune function, and overall health of urban African Americans, and to test a novel structural-level intervention to reduce the negative impact of racism. Significant disparities in major chronic illnesses continue to describe the current picture of health for African Americans, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and overweight/obesity. Researchers have long understood stress to play a critical role in negative health outcomes, and particular attention has been paid to the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenocortical (HPA) axis as a key pathway. Because experiences with racism constitute a significant stressor in the lives of African Americans, understanding the ways in which racism activates the axis will have profound meaning in addressing the determinants of African American health disparities. More broadly, given the role of the HPA axis in many systems, the proposed research has the potential to uncover critical information on the impact of social processes on overall physical and mental health, and to delineate unstudied paths in brain-behavior relationships. In two sub-studies, the proposed research will enroll urban African Americans from New York City in longitudinal investigations. Study 1 is an investigation of how neighborhood-level institutional racism and perceived individual and collective racism affect immune and metabolic function and overall physical health, psychological well-being, and health behaviors. Study 2 is neighborhood-level intervention to minimize the likelihood of internalized racism, vis-¿vis a racism ""countermarketing"" campaign. Outdoor advertising will be employed to deliver stark facts about American inequality in predominantly African American neighborhoods, thereby raising consciousness and minimizing negative health outcomes. Taken together, the proposed research attempts to answer two critical unanswered questions in biomedical and behavioral research: 1) How does racism get into the body?; and 2) What do we do about it?   Public Health Relevance:  Although racism is well known to be a significant life stressor for African Americans, no research has studied the effects racism has on critical biological pathways, such as immune function. Additionally, although other negative effects of racism have been documented, no study has yet created a broad-based intervention to counter the stress of racism on African American lives. The proposed study will do both, which could have a major impact on the reduction of African American health disparities.       ","Immunologic Effects and a Structural ""Countermarketing"" Intervention: Racism, the",7853512,DP2OD006513,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' immune function ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' Address ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Immunologics ', ' Immunochemical Immunologic ', ' Process ', ' Social Impacts ', ' Advertising ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Biological ', ' racism ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Conscious ', ' Consciousness ', ' Individual ', ' Inequality ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' New York City ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Metabolic ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Life ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Urban Health ', ' Well in self ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Mental well-being ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Attention ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' brain behavior ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",OD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,DP2,2009,304378,0.04311299030521568
"Stress, Lead, Iron Deficiency and Neurodevelopment Social stressors, iron deficiency anemia, and lead exposure are all environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopment in young children. All three factors are highly prevalent in poor communities, whether in Mexico or the U.S. There are scant human epidemiologic studies on chronic social stress and human neurodevelopment. In addition, previous studies of child development and neurotoxicants have typically analyzed covariate markers of social stress as independent predictors of neurodevelopment; and thus, only considered social factors as potential confounders in their data analysis. There are biological reasons to believe that stress potentiates the toxicity of iron deficiency anemia and lead poisoning. If so, then understanding this relationship may be the key to designing effective public health interventions designed to improve neurodevelopment and may explain the lack of effectiveness of prevention/treatment regimens for lead poisoning and iron deficiency. A prospective cohort study with a large sample size is needed to address the potential multiplicative effects of combined stress/iron deficiency anemia and combined stress/lead exposure in predicting infant development.  This resubmission includes new data from a pilot study of stress-lead/stress-anemia interactions in 120 mother infant pairs conducted since the prior application, which demonstrates study feasibility and evidence for the hypothesized interactions. In this proposal we will measure maternal stress levels, infant iron deficiency anemia and lead exposure in a cohort of mother-infant pairs living in Mexico City and longitudinally measure maternal stress, iron stores, lead exposure, salivary cortisol and neurodevelopment beginning pre-natally and extending 3 years post-partum. This project will determine the independent effect of pre- and post-partum maternal stress in predicting infant development, and the multiplicative joint effects of maternal stress/iron deficiency and maternal stress/lead poisoning in predicting infant development.

"Race/Ethnicity, Psychosocial and Environmental Stressors, and Telomere Length    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to conduct the first community-based study of racial differences in telomere length and allostatic load in adults of broad age range and their association with urban stressors. We hypothesize that chronic stressors experienced by black urban residents accelerate biological aging and chronic disease onset. Evidence suggests that leukocyte telomere length (TL) may be an indicator of biological age that can be affected by stress; and that allostatic load is an indicator of stress-mediated wear on important body systems. We have a unique opportunity to supplement survey data scheduled to be collected by the Healthy Environments Partnership (HEP) a partnership between the University of Michigan and community-based organizations and health service agencies in Detroit with blood collection and lab analyses of telomere length, telomere-related compounds, and allostatic load, including measures of the biological stress response, inflammation, and cardiovascular and metabolic risk. By appending a venous blood draw to the HEP survey, we can construct a data set including these biomeasures and detailed psychosocial and physical environmental measures in a cost-effective way; enhance access to a hard-to-reach population; and facilitate dissemination of study results to improve community health. We will estimate a series of regressions of TL and allostatic load on race, controlling for the confounding effects of age, gender, and socioeconomic characteristics and exploring the extent to which psychosocial or environmental stressors mediate remaining racial differences. To ensure findings are not driven by functional form we will reanalyze the data using matching methods. We will also model disease outcomes, conditional on telomere length, on high oxidative stress or low telomerase activity to explore biological mechanistic pathways between telomere length and chronic disease. Our investigative team brings exceptional expertise in social and behavioral science, cell biology, psychology and biochemistry to insure state-of-the art telomere measurement, theory-driven and statistically sound social science measures and models, and appropriate interpretation of study findings to provide important insights. We expect study findings to shed light on the plausibility of cumulative stress hypotheses to explain the social patterning of disease; the viability of telomere length as a biomeasure of aging; and the mechanistic pathways through which stressors may be linked to telomere length and disease processes. If findings from this interdisciplinary collaborative effort support study hypotheses, this could constitute a significant advance in the understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie racial inequality in health.

"Health Disparities and Stress Hypothesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application argues that progress in understanding the origins of racial and socioeconomic position (SEP) disparities has been impeded by several problems, the two most important of which are the problem of misclassification and the failure to adequately assess differences in stress exposure. In our view, information on the origins of health disparities can most effectively be pursued by an approach that avoids the typical classification error of counting disordered individuals as non-disordered because they do not exhibit the particular disease or disorder under investigation or have a nascent disorder that has not progressed enough to be clinically detectable. We suggest that such misclassification is likely to have obscured potentially modifiable factors that are centrally implicated in the documented elevation in health risk among African Americans and persons of low SEP, and argue that it can be avoided by a joining of biomarker methodologies for estimating physical health status and reliable estimates of the presence of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems within a community-based population study. There is also evidence indicating that the failure of prior research to take account of a range of social stressors has significantly biased estimates of racial and SEP differences in exposure to stress and resulted in the systematic underestimation of the contributions of stress exposure to the occurrence of racial and SEP disparities in health. Among the unique aspects of the proposed research are: 1) the substantial avoidance of epidemiologic misclassification through the simultaneous consideration of one or more operationalizations of allostatic load and the assessment of cell aging, in combination with both clinical and subclinical assessments of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems; 2) estimation of stress exposure in terms of lifetime exposure to major and potential traumatic events, recent life events, chronic stressors, discrimination stress, and, among African Americans, stress arising from colorism and from uncertainty and/or ambiguity associated with covert discrimination; and 3) in the context provided by 1 and 2 above, to assess an exceptionally comprehensive array of hypothesized risk/protective factors including, through a subsequent grant application, gene-environment interactions. We will study a representative community-based sample of 1600 adults, ages 25 to 65 selected such that half are African American, half are female, and sufficient numbers of middle and upper SEP African Americans who do and do not live in segregated areas are included to allow at least substantial disentanglement of the effects of race, SEP, and segregation. The research proposed is aimed toward the identification of potentially modifiable social, contextual, and personal factors that contribute to racial and SEP health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study addresses the social determinants of racial and socioeconomic position disparities in health.

"Physiological reactivity to acute stress during pregnancy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm delivery, an increasingly frequent occurrence in the United States, is associated with significant family burden and an estimated societal cost of at least $26 billion per year. In the U.S., the preterm birth rate is 12-13% as compared to 5-9% in other developed countries. Persistent racial disparities contribute to this discrepancy. Psychosocial stress and related physiological sequelae may contribute to preterm birth overall, as well as to racial disparities in preterm birth. The experience of chronic stress, such as that conferred by racial minority status, may sensitize physiological stress responses. Indeed, as compared to Caucasians, African-Americans exhibit greater cardiovascular reactivity to a variety of acute stressors. Importantly, blood pressure, glucocorticoid, and catecholamine responses to acute stress are attenuated during healthy pregnancy as compared to nonpregnancy. This adaptation may protect the mother and fetus from potentially detrimental effects of maternal physiological activation. Thus, women who exhibit greater and more extended physiological reactions to everyday stressors may be at increased risk for negative perinatal outcomes. Notably, no studies of acute stress during pregnancy have examined inflammatory immune responses or mechanisms underlying blood pressure change (i.e., cardiac output, total peripheral resistance). Moreover, limited information is available regarding effects of race on physiological adaptation to pregnancy. The current study will address important gaps in the literature by examining cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune reactivity to acute stress among 40 healthy pregnant women (20 Caucasian, 20 African-American) and 40 demographically matched nonpregnant control women. This research is designed to ultimately lead to the identification of women at greater risk for negative perinatal outcomes and elucidation of mechanisms underlying increased risk, providing a basis for individualized health care services. Specific Aim #1: To utilize more comprehensive and advanced methodology to assess physiological reactivity during pregnancy versus nonpregnancy, including measures of inflammation, impedance cardiography, and glucocorticoid receptor function. Hypothesis #1: Pregnant women will show attenuated physiological responses to acute stress as compared to nonpregnant women. Specific Aim #2: To examine racial differences in physiological reactivity during pregnancy versus nonpregnancy. Hypothesis #2: As compared to Caucasian women, African-American women will exhibit greater physiological reactivity to stress during pregnancy and nonpregnancy. Specific Aim #3: To examine psychosocial correlates of physiological reactivity during pregnancy and nonpregnancy. Hypothesis #3: Women reporting greater distress will exhibit greater physiological reactivity during pregnancy and nonpregnancy. Specific Aim #4: To examine associations between physiological reactivity and length of gestation. Hypothesis #4: Greater physiological reactivity to acute stress will predict shorter gestational length. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will fill important gaps in our knowledge regarding physiological adaption during pregnancy and effects of race on such adaptation. Information gained from this study will provide the groundwork for the following: 1) identification of women at greater risk of negative perinatal outcomes; 2) describing physiological mechanisms underlying the link between stress and risk of preterm delivery; and 3) providing interventions designed to reduce the effects of stress and promote healthy pregnancy and fetal development.            PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study will fill important gaps in our knowledge regarding physiological adaption during pregnancy and effects of race on such adaptation.

"Integrative Stress Reduction for Maternal-Child Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to promote the candidate's development as an independent clinical trial researcher in mind-body medicine with a focus on reducing disparities in maternal-child health. Rates of preterm birth and low birth weight are increasing and are persistently higher among vulnerable U.S. populations. Animal and human models consistently implicate maternal stress as a significant risk factor in the etiology of adverse birth outcomes. Maladaptive patterns in hormonal and cardiovascular aspects of the stress response appear to be linked with preterm birth and low birth weight. In addition, psychological stress and poor coping may drive physiological stress responses that lead to adverse birth outcomes. Dr. Duncan's research, using the framework of revised Stress and Coping Theory (Folkman, 1997), has shown that pregnant women who learn mind-body practices during pregnancy report healthy improvements in levels of perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety, mindfulness, positive and negative affect, and depression in the perinatal period. The candidate seeks additional training in the design and conduct of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of mind-body interventions and understanding of physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying the stress response during pregnancy. The    University of California, San Francisco is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides access to experts in RCT methodology, integrative medicine, and the basic sciences of psychological and physiological aspects of the stress response, including the physiology of human pregnancy. The training plan includes formal coursework, informal tutorials with experts in their respective fields, and supervision of Dr. Duncan's leadership as PI on an RCT assessing the efficacy of a mind-body enhanced version of an existing, culturally-sensitive, group-based model of prenatal healthcare delivery. Rigorous testing of hypotheses regarding the impact of the mind-body practices will occur by comparing the effects of the mindbody enhanced program with the standard program. Effects of each intervention on psychological stress and coping mechanisms, stress physiology (neuroendocrine and cardiovascular/ autonomic nervous system function), and birth outcomes (gestational age and birth weight) will be compared. The results of the study will provide initial information about whether a mind-body intervention targeted to reduce stress during the perinatal period through mindfulness may provide clinical benefit for improving birth outcomes, thus informing development of an R01 proposal and advancing the long term goal of reducing health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maternal stress is consistently linked with preterm birth and low birth weight. The integrative stress reduction intervention being tested targets psychological stress and coping, stress hormones, and cardiovascular stress reactivity through mindfulness practices. If the enhanced intervention is effective, it will help to address a key public health problem and may help reduce health disparities in maternal-child health.          ",Integrative Stress

"Causes and Impact of Minority Stress on Health and Development in Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual orientation group disparities in several critical health domains are now well documented, with sexual minorities reporting more psychological distress, substance use and dependence, and eating disorders symptoms. Little is known about the reasons underlying higher risk behaviors among sexual minorities relative to heterosexuals. Herein, we propose to explain these sexual orientation disparities by testing our Sexual Minority Stress Theory (SMST). SMST is based on society's stigmatization of homosexuality. Gay-related stress, the experience by a sexual-minority individual of society's stigmatization, consists of external stressors (such as prejudice, discrimination, verbal abuse, physical violence) perpetrated by known individuals (such as kin, heterosexual friends) and strangers in the community. Gay-related stress also consists of internal stress, in which the sexual-minority individual internalizes society's stigmatization, such as possessing negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Our proposed research will address the impact of gay-related stress on disparities between and among sexual orientation subgroups in psychological distress, physiological distress (cortisol, DHEA), health behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood, and examine moderators, such as the effect of parent-child relationships on the relations between sexual orientation and gay-related stress and the effect of coping on the relations between gay-related stress and both psychological and physiological distress. Gay-related stress may be particularly important in influencing a sexual minority youth's development and psychosocial adjustment in emerging adulthood. Our research will be sensitive to important precursors of gay-related stress, such as gender nonconformity. It will also examine how sex, age at experiencing gay-related stress, sexual minority status and transitions in status, concordant vs. nonconcordant orientation patterns among sexual minorities, and sexual identity development vary with gay-related stress, health, adaptation, and adjustment outcomes. We will collect new self-report survey and biological data to investigate these critical issues in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal cohort study of 16,882 U.S. adolescents and emerging adults begun in 1996 and ongoing. Specifically, we will add 3 data collection phases to more than 10 years of data collected from GUTS and link the youths' data with those of their mothers, who comprise the Nurses' Health Study II. We will examine disparities in violence victimization in childhood and adolescence and other forms of gay-related stress and the impact of these over time on subsequent psychological and physiological distress, substance use and eating disordered behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood.

"An Ethnographic Study of African-Caribbean Women with Schizophrenia in England    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is an ethnographic investigation of lived experiences of UK African-Caribbean women, with and without schizophrenia, to illuminate the socio-cultural mechanisms and processes that contribute to their high prevalence of the illness. Over the past twenty years, epidemiological studies have reported consistently that individuals of Caribbean origin in England have the highest rate of schizophrenia ever recorded anywhere ((Littlewood, 2001). Research data suggest that the increased rates of schizophrenia in this population are not due to genetic vulnerability or biological factors but to environmental stress and other social risk factors that are not yet fully understood. Using ethnographic research methods, the researcher will explore how UK African-Caribbeans' subjective experiences of their social worlds shape their sense of self, their emotional experiences, and the ways they experience and cope with stress. Building on existing epidemiological findings, she will conduct a micro-analysis of identified risk factors to better understand how they play out in individuals' daily life and generate specific hypotheses about how the social environment may lead to greater vulnerability to schizophrenia. She will also focus on African-Caribbean women, a population that is largely neglected in schizophrenia research in England. This ethnographic work will complement the epidemiological studies by providing the contextual and interpretative frameworks to analyze the experiences of African-Caribbeans in England and the various risks factors associated with schizophrenia in this population. It will contribute to an understanding of the role of socio-environmental factors in the development of schizophrenia and anthropological theories on the long-term impacts of immigration over the life course. It will also help to bring to fore the experiences of African-Caribbean women in schizophrenia and health disparity research. The findings of this study will advance our understanding of how the social environment contributes to the development and experience of schizophrenia. They will be immediately useful to mental health professionals and public policy makers, and will help to facilitate better intervention and treatment programs for schizophrenia. In addition, with an emphasis on second-generation UK African- Caribbean women with schizophrenia, this study will illuminate the long-term impacts of migration on the children of immigrants.          ",An Ethnographic Study of African-Caribbean Women with Schizophrenia in England,7588014,R36MH081727,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease susceptibility ', ' liability to disease ', ' disease/disorder proneness/risk ', ' Diathesis ', ' Economics ', ' England ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Ethnography ', ' ethnographic ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' London ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Immigrant ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Play ', ' Shapes ', ' Psychotic Disorders ', ' Psychoses ', ' Public Policy ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schizophrenia ', ' schizophrenic ', ' dementia praecox ', ' Schizophrenic Disorders ', ' Social Change ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Life ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' Investigation ', ' Walkers ', ' West Indies ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' British ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' Participant ', ' treatment program ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' emotional distress ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' social ', ' Generations ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' neglect ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Mind ', ' migration ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' emotional experience ', ' high risk ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO,R36,2009,37584,0.04262238231570865
"Social Influences on Early Adult Stress Biomarkers The goal of our project is to conduct a population-level investigation of social contexts, stress, and health. We integrate multiple biomarkers of stress with current theory and measurement tools from the social and behavioral sciences to gain a better understanding of how social contexts ""get under the skin"" to affect stress and health in young adults. We use data from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) in pursuit of three objectives: 1) Examine the interrelations among multiple subjective and physiological measures of stress; 2) Investigate how measures of socio-economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships in childhood/adolescence and over the transition to adulthood influence stress in early adulthood; and 3) Test competing theoretical models of the joint influence of socio- economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships on stress. We examine subjective measures of stress, including perceived stress, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of anxiety, as well as physiological measures of endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and inflammatory activity. We take advantage of the breadth and depth of the Add Health dataset to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date of how social stress affects physical and mental health. Additionally, the large sample size and racial, ethnic, and economic diversity of Add Health allow us to investigate the extent to which stress leads to health disparities. Stress is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, and investigating the physiological mechanisms through which social contexts affect human health can help investigators, clinicians, and policy makers to: a) identify adverse psychosocial environments; b) better understand predisease and disease pathways; and c) inform interventions to reduce exposure to stressors, reduce the adverse impact of stressors on physiology, and prevent the emergence of stress-related disorders.

"Health Disparities and Stress Hypothesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application argues that progress in understanding the origins of racial and socioeconomic position (SEP) disparities has been impeded by several problems, the two most important of which are the problem of misclassification and the failure to adequately assess differences in stress exposure. In our view, information on the origins of health disparities can most effectively be pursued by an approach that avoids the typical classification error of counting disordered individuals as non-disordered because they do not exhibit the particular disease or disorder under investigation or have a nascent disorder that has not progressed enough to be clinically detectable. We suggest that such misclassification is likely to have obscured potentially modifiable factors that are centrally implicated in the documented elevation in health risk among African Americans and persons of low SEP, and argue that it can be avoided by a joining of biomarker methodologies for estimating physical health status and reliable estimates of the presence of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems within a community-based population study. There is also evidence indicating that the failure of prior research to take account of a range of social stressors has significantly biased estimates of racial and SEP differences in exposure to stress and resulted in the systematic underestimation of the contributions of stress exposure to the occurrence of racial and SEP disparities in health. Among the unique aspects of the proposed research are: 1) the substantial avoidance of epidemiologic misclassification through the simultaneous consideration of one or more operationalizations of allostatic load and the assessment of cell aging, in combination with both clinical and subclinical assessments of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems; 2) estimation of stress exposure in terms of lifetime exposure to major and potential traumatic events, recent life events, chronic stressors, discrimination stress, and, among African Americans, stress arising from colorism and from uncertainty and/or ambiguity associated with covert discrimination; and 3) in the context provided by 1 and 2 above, to assess an exceptionally comprehensive array of hypothesized risk/protective factors including, through a subsequent grant application, gene-environment interactions. We will study a representative community-based sample of 1600 adults, ages 25 to 65 selected such that half are African American, half are female, and sufficient numbers of middle and upper SEP African Americans who do and do not live in segregated areas are included to allow at least substantial disentanglement of the effects of race, SEP, and segregation. The research proposed is aimed toward the identification of potentially modifiable social, contextual, and personal factors that contribute to racial and SEP health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study addresses the social determinants of racial and socioeconomic position disparities in health.

"A Mindfulness-based Intervention to Reduce Diabetes Risk in Prediabetic Afr-Ameri DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-diabetes, characterized by glucose levels that are above normal but below the diagnostic criteria for diabetes, is an increasingly common condition affecting approximately 54 million U.S. adults. African Americans are disproportionately affected by pre-diabetes and experience high rates of diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality including damage to the circulatory system, kidneys, and nervous system. Patients with pre-diabetes who increase their physical activity and improve their diets have reduced risk of developing diabetes. Psychological distress negatively influences the course of the disease by increasing deleterious health behaviors; preventing scheduling and maintenance of positive behavior change; and stimulating HPA- axis activation and dysregulation, which may have a direct impact on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. African Americans may have increased exposure to stress and increased vulnerability to adverse stress-related health outcomes like diabetes, because of their unique history, socio-cultural experiences, and societal position in the U.S. Helping individuals to reduce stress and to increase healthy coping strategies may enhance conventional diabetes prevention efforts, especially among African Americans. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a mind-body practice with a wide range of health benefits, has been shown to result in statistically significant reductions in psychological stress and anxiety in randomized, controlled studies. Mindfulness training is cost-effective in comparison with other small-group or individualized programs, and can be taught safely and effectively by well-trained instructors. There is little research, and no randomized, controlled trials of MBSR as a treatment for individuals with pre-diabetes. There is also little research on the acceptability of MBSR program to a pre-diabetic subgroup of African Americans, or on the acceptability of an MBSR program for a general population of African Americans. Overall goals of this exploratory pilot study are to study the potential efficacy of a diabetes prevention education program that includes training in mindfulness-based stress reduction for pre-diabetic African Americans. Specific Aims are 1) to determine the feasibility of developing a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based diabetes prevention program (treatment group) with a conventional diabetes prevention program (control group) in improving glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic African American adults; 2) to identify relevant physiological and psychological secondary outcomes associated with a mindfulness-based, educational self-care program in African Americans with pre-diabetes; 3) to assess the acceptability and cultural relevance of MBSR for pre-diabetic African Americans via a post-intervention qualitative study, to include interviews of participants, dropouts, and instructors; and 4) to identify, and find solutions for, problems in conducting a well-powered clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a mindfulness-based diabetes prevention program in improving glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic African-Americans.    This project will investigate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of a mind-body intervention, Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), as an adjunct to health education in reducing impaired glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic African Americans. We predict that reduction of stress and improvement in coping resources through training in diabetes education enhanced by MBSR training will positively influence health behaviors and physiological responses to stress, and thus improve pre-diabetic state.",A Mindfulness-based Intervention to Reduce Diabetes Risk in Prediabetic Afr-Ameri,7661085,R21AT004276,"['Data Collection ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' dietary lipid ', ' insulin secretion ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dropout ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Mind-Body Intervention ', ' mind body wellness ', ' mind body treatments ', ' mind body therapy ', ' mind body techniques ', ' mind body medicine skills ', ' mind body approach ', ' Mind-Body Medicine (with OBSSR) ', ' Mind-Body Medicine ', ' National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ', ' NCCAM ', ' Subgroup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Prevention education ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' glucose tolerance ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Distress ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Funding ', ' Maintenance ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity -

"Sex stress emotional disorders: uniting preclinical and epidemiologic research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Advancing Novel Science in Women's Health Research (ANSWHR) We propose (1) to bring together researchers who have made important advances in preclinical, experimental, and epidemiological research on stress responsivity and psychopathology; (2) to integrate their findings across disciplines and identify key questions related to gender disparities; and (3) to plan a new program of research that takes a developmental approach to sex differences in stress responsivity as they affect depression and anxiety disorders in young people. The program of work has three aspects: (1) Two annual meetings of the workgroup members to identify key questions and plan a program of analysis of existing data sets. Meetings will be designed so that participants will learn as well as teach. At the second meeting, each work group member to commit to be first author on one or more specific papers. (2) A program of data analysis to be carried out at the Center for Developmental Epidemiology, Duke University. Analyses will be reported to the group by email; group members can request additional follow-up analyses. Monthly conference calls between meetings will discuss output of analyses and plan further work. (3) An application for an Interdisciplinary Developmental Science Center for Mental Health (IDSC) or similar mechanism, to be submitted in October 2010. Questions to be addressed include the following: 1. What has been learned from animal research about sex differences in the effects of early adversity on neurobiological parameters, such as the HPA axis, the autonomic nervous system, and neural systems implicated in psychopathology? 2. What has been learned from laboratory and epidemiological research with humans about sex differences in the effects of early adversity on neurobiological parameters, such as the HPA axis, the autonomic nervous system, and neural systems implicated in anxiety and depression in the first decades of life? 3. Where do these bodies of work agree, where do they conflict, and where are they most important gaps? We expect that the answers to questions 1 to 3 will lead to the planning of a Center application to focus on such questions as: 4. How does gender moderate the effects of childhood stress on mental health and neurobiological function; i.e., what are the interactions between stress response systems and sex steroids? 5. What are the sex-specific effects of stress and life events in different developmental stages or during transitions between stages (e.g., puberty) on risk for anxiety and depression? 6. How does the timing of differences in onset of anxiety and depression in males and females relate to sex differences in psychological and neurobiological functioning? PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Many psychiatric disorders occur more often in women than in men. Some have argued that this is because women suffer from a greater number of stressful events, or respond differently to stressors in their lives. This workgroup of world leaders in stress research will bring together the preclinical, experimental, and epidemiological evidence on stress, gender, and depression and anxiety disorders and plan a program of integrated research on gender disparities in the role played by stress in mental illness.                            ",Sex stress emotional disorders: uniting preclinical and

"Hypertension in Black Americans: Environment, Behavior, and Biology    Description (provided by applicant): Hypertension (HTN) is a major health problem for Black Americans: as a group they have the highest rate of HTN in the world. HTN develops at younger ages, is more severe, and leads to more adverse clinical outcomes and higher death rates for Blacks than for Whites. Chronic psychosocial stressors (e.g., daily hassles, racial discrimination and financial strain) are believed to contribute to the development of HTN. The purposes of the proposed mentored patient-oriented research career development award are to provide the necessary training experiences so that the candidate can achieve independence as an investigator conducting biobehavioral research and to begin to address the question of why some Blacks develop HTN while other Blacks do not. The training goals are to 1) expand knowledge of cardiovascular physiology and pathological mechanisms leading to HTN; 2) obtain expertise in the assessment of psychosocial stress and the integration of measures of psychosocial stress with physiological indices of stress; 3) obtain expertise in impedance-derived measurement of total peripheral resistance and to become skilled in the assessment of cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to acute laboratory-based stressors; 4) become proficient in the design, conduct and analysis of longitudinal studies and associated advanced statistical methods; and 5) disseminate results of research and develop a fundable R01 proposal. The candidate will engage in a 3-year intensive, supervised career development plan that will include: a) formal course work in HTN, stress, and advanced research methods; b) hands-on laboratory experiences with her mentors, consultants, and specialists; c) interdisciplinary experiences such as journal clubs, seminars, and conferences; and d) participation in mentors' research team meetings. To compliment the training, the candidate will conduct a study to examine factors related to HTN in 128 Black men and women between the ages of 25 and 55. The study will compare Blacks with and without HTN for differences in indicators of allostatic load (sleep blood pressure, sleep total peripheral resistance, cortisol awakening response, and obesity); in chronic psychosocial stressors (daily hassles, racial discrimination, and financial strain); and in the moderating effect of positive and negative emotions, religious coping, and John Henryism active coping on the influence of chronic psychosocial stressors on indicators of allostatic load. A team of experienced researchers will serve as mentors and consultants in the areas of a) HTN and cardiovascular disease, b) physiological and psychological stress, c) biomedical assessment, and d) design and analysis of longitudinal research.           ","Hypertension in Black Americans: Environment, Behavior, and Biology",7661832,K23NR010208,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Peripheral Resistance ', ' Total Peripheral Resistance ', ' Systemic Vascular Resistance ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award ', ' Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) ', ' K23 Program ', ' K23 Mechanism ', ' K23 Award ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' electric impedance ', ' Impedance ', ' Electrical Impedance ', ' systemin ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' allostatic load ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Hand ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' indexing ', ' Training ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Laboratories ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Measurement ', ' Development Plans ', ' American Heart Association ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biology ', ' meetings ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' trait ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Measures ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Specialist ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' resilience ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' biomarker ', ' coping mechanism ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' ']",NINR,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K23,2009,119392,0.1018653189260017
"Race-based social stress and health trajectories from adolescence to adulthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad aim of this Grand Opportunity Grant is to understand how race-based social stress, racial/ethnic (R/E) identity, and biological functioning contribute to health and healthy aging. Using the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study (MADICS) we propose to complement existing psychosocial, mental, and physical health data with the collection of a comprehensive set of measures of biological systems intimately tied to health and disease and highly relevant to the aging processes. MADICS is a nationally-recognized 17- year longitudinal study of family, school, neighborhood, and peer influences on the healthy and successful development of an initial sample of 1482 early adolescents and their families (60% African American, 35% European American, and similar proportions of ""middle class"" SES within these groups). Measures gathered across seven waves of data collection (ages 12 to 30) include histories of perceived discrimination based on race/ethnicity; beliefs, behaviors, and feelings about one's perceived R/E classification (i.e., R/E identity); mental and physical health; and psychosocial functioning (e.g., educational and occupational attainment). Here we propose to add a wide range of measures of biological systems associated with health and disease and highly relevant to the prospective study of aging processes. The primary goal is to explore how developmental histories of discrimination contribute to the pre-disease and health states of approximately 300 young adults (approximately 32 years old) and the extent to which these relations vary by R/E classification, SES, and R/E identity. Specifically, we will assess (1) the basal functioning of multiple physiological systems (endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, inflammatory, sleep) reflecting well-established risk factors for a variety of poor health outcomes; (2) the acute reactivity and recovery of three physiological response systems tied to the development of chronic disease (i.e., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis, autonomic nervous system, inflammatory system) in the context of a daily diary study and also in an experimental setting in which we expose individuals to a discriminatory episode; (3) inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell resistance to the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, gene expression profiling of leukocytes to identify broad groups of genes associated with social stress (e.g., inflammation-related genes), and bioinformatic analyses to identify transcriptional control pathways that might potentially mediate these effects; and (4) person-centered health trajectory profiles constructed from mental and physical health and the proposed biomarkers and the extent to which their relations to histories of discrimination are moderated by R/E classification, SES, R/E identity, and parent socialization factors. An additional aim of this grant is to develop methods that can become part of the toolkit of future field-based health and aging researchers (e.g., validation of the measurement of TNF-alpha and IL6 in Oral Mucosal Transudate and the development of a field-friendly stress reactivity protocol that can be conducted in a mobile psychophysiological van).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disparities in health associated with racial/ethnic classification persist in the US. The elimination of such health disparities is of paramount importance for public health. Understanding factors associated with health disparities is critical for their elimination. This application includes studies that focus on better understanding the biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to health disparities.           Disparities in health associated with racial/ethnic classification persist in the US.

"Integrative Stress Reduction for Maternal-Child Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to promote the candidate's development as an independent clinical trial researcher in mind-body medicine with a focus on reducing disparities in maternal-child health. Rates of preterm birth and low birth weight are increasing and are persistently higher among vulnerable U.S. populations. Animal and human models consistently implicate maternal stress as a significant risk factor in the etiology of adverse birth outcomes. Maladaptive patterns in hormonal and cardiovascular aspects of the stress response appear to be linked with preterm birth and low birth weight. In addition, psychological stress and poor coping may drive physiological stress responses that lead to adverse birth outcomes. Dr. Duncan's research, using the framework of revised Stress and Coping Theory (Folkman, 1997), has shown that pregnant women who learn mind-body practices during pregnancy report healthy improvements in levels of perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety, mindfulness, positive and negative affect, and depression in the perinatal period. The candidate seeks additional training in the design and conduct of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of mind-body interventions and understanding of physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying the stress response during pregnancy. The    University of California, San Francisco is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides access to experts in RCT methodology, integrative medicine, and the basic sciences of psychological and physiological aspects of the stress response, including the physiology of human pregnancy. The training plan includes formal coursework, informal tutorials with experts in their respective fields, and supervision of Dr. Duncan's leadership as PI on an RCT assessing the efficacy of a mind-body enhanced version of an existing, culturally-sensitive, group-based model of prenatal healthcare delivery. Rigorous testing of hypotheses regarding the impact of the mind-body practices will occur by comparing the effects of the mindbody enhanced program with the standard program. Effects of each intervention on psychological stress and coping mechanisms, stress physiology (neuroendocrine and cardiovascular/ autonomic nervous system function), and birth outcomes (gestational age and birth weight) will be compared. The results of the study will provide initial information about whether a mind-body intervention targeted to reduce stress during the perinatal period through mindfulness may provide clinical benefit for improving birth outcomes, thus informing development of an R01 proposal and advancing the long term goal of reducing health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maternal stress is consistently linked with preterm birth and low birth weight. The integrative stress reduction intervention being tested targets psychological stress and coping, stress hormones, and cardiovascular stress reactivity through mindfulness practices. If the enhanced intervention is effective, it will help to address a key public health problem and may help reduce health disparities in maternal-child health.          ",Integrative Stress

"Stress Management Among Latinos with Type 2 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of a stress reduction intervention among Latinos with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) served by Hartford Hospital on: a) HbA1c levels, and b) stress reactivity measured through a blood glucose sensor and an automated Interactive Voice Response System (IVR). To obtain 200 study completers, 250 Latinos with T2D will be recruited from the 'Amigos en Salud' clinic. They will be randomly assigned to either: a) the control group that will receive 3 community health worker (CHW) led nutrition educational group sessions, or b) the intervention group that in addition will receive an 8-session stress management intervention delivered by a trained CHW. Intervention will be delivered at the Hispanic Health Council in a group format (12 members per group). The primary outcome of the intervention will be HbA1c measured at baseline, post-intervention (9 weeks post-enrollment) and 6 months. The secondary outcome will be stress reactivity measured through an IVR system that involves inserting a metabolic sensor that participants will carry for 3 days as well as daily reporting, via an automated voice system, of stress related events and coping during the same period of time and 6 month s post-enrollment. A subsample (n=75) will participate in the IVR and metabolic sensor measurements conducted pre/post intervention. All study participants will be applied an e-tablet based survey in their homes to assess mental health, nutrition and basic socio-economic and demographic parameters. Blood samples will be collected by a community phlebotomist in the participants' homes at the same time points.

"Stress, Gene-Environment Interaction and Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Although psychosocial stress has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of cardiovascular disease, empirical verifications of the effects of stress and the biological mechanisms through which stress operates remain rare. A major limitation has been the absence of population studies with direct biologic measures of stress (such as measures of levels of stress hormones), so that their link to social antecedents and to biological precursors of cardiovascular disease can be studied. It has also become increasingly apparent that social conditions and stressors must interact with genetic makeup, and that some of these exposures may modify gene expression through changes in DNA methylation but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the gene-environment interactions and epigenetic changes related to psychosocial factors. A major goal of this project is to better understand the ways in which socially patterned stress interacts with genetics and biology to influence cardiovascular-related outcomes. Using data from the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a large, multiethnic population sample, we propose to investigate long-term associations of the stress response (as characterized by multiple measures of stress hormones) with social/psychosocial antecedents and cardiovascular-related outcomes, as well as modifications of the stress response by variations in selected candidate genes, and links between psychosocial factors and epigenetic changes. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of repeat measures of stress hormones with social and psychosocial factors and with biological precursors of cardiovascular disease including inflammation/hemostasis and measures of insulin resistance and adiposity; (2) To examine interactions between cortisol levels and polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor gene with respect to cardiovascular-related outcomes; (3) To examine the extent to which polymorphisms of biologically relevant genes modify the response to a psychological stress challenge; and (4) To examine epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) of the glucocorticoid receptor gene as well as genomic DNA methylation and their association with (a) lifecourse social exposures; (b) cortisol and hemodynamic responses to a stress challenge; and (c) biological parameters previously linked to stress exposures. Our study will enhance our understanding not only of the epidemiologic links between stress and cardiovascular disease but also of the biologic mechanisms (involving genetic polymorphisms and changes to gene expression) through which these effects may be mediated. By illustrating how the study of genetic variability, biological markers, and social conditions can be integrated to enhance our understanding of the causes of ill health our project has the potential for contributing to major paradigmatic change in health research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been argued that stress may be important to the development of cardiovascular disease, but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the way in which stress operates. This study will investigate the links between stress and biological factors important to cardiovascular disease, including the interactions between stress and genes. This approach is necessary to better understand the importance of stress and to develop preventative interventions.           Relevance It has been argued that stress may be important to the development of cardiovascular disease, but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the way in which stress operates.

"Impact of Omega-3 Intake During Pregnancy on Maternal Stress and Infant Outcome    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnant women living in poverty often experience chronic stress, and consequently higher levels of stress hormones. In utero exposure to high levels of stress hormones can negatively affect the developing fetus and later, the infant's capacity for emotion and behavioral regulation. In this proposal we describe a developing program of research designed to reduce the negative impact of prenatal stress on infant health and development via nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy. DHA is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member of the omega-3 fatty acid family. DHA is found in its highest concentrations in neural cell membranes, affecting receptor function, neurotransmitter uptake, and signal transmission. There is growing evidence that low levels of dietary DHA intake are associated with suboptimal response to stress and that DHA supplementation can modulate stress response. Aims: The goals of the proposed study are to explore whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy is associated with 1) a reduction in maternal perceived stress during pregnancy; 2) a more modulated maternal cortisol response to a stress stimulus during pregnancy, and 3) more optimal regulation of emotion and behavior in the infant. Approach: Sixty-five pregnant women living in inner-city poverty, who consume less than two servings of fish per week, will be randomly assigned to receive 450 mg/daily of DHA or placebo beginning at 16-20 weeks gestation through the end of pregnancy. Perceived stress, pregnancy related stress, stressful life events, anxiety, and depression will be assessed at baseline and at 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy and at 4 months post-partum. DHA levels will be assessed at baseline and at 36 weeks of pregnancy. Cortisol response to the Trier Social Stress Test will be measured at baseline, 24, and 30 weeks. At 4 months post-partum infant temperament, cognitive development and stress reactivity will be assessed in the laboratory. Investigators: This proposal stems from an NIMH R21 Translational Science Network on prenatal stress and mental health outcomes in the offspring. Three members of that network, Drs. Keenan, Carter, and Glover, are all funded investigators in the area of prenatal stress and child mental health, which is a prioritized area of exploratory research that could directly impact clinical care. They are collaborating on the present application. Innovation: This will be the first randomized controlled study of the effect of DHA supplementation on stress response in pregnant women living in inner-city poverty, and the first study of maternal DHA supplementation on emotion and stress regulation in their infants. Relevance: If DHA supplementation is associated with reductions in perceived stress, more modulated maternal cortisol response to stress, and more optimal emotional and behavioral regulation in the infant, even within the context inner-city poverty, then a comprehensive program of research on the mechanisms by which these associations evolve and the potential for broad-based prevention of poor developmental outcomes among children born to women living in poverty can be launched. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This will be the first study of the effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in pregnant women living in inner-city poverty on the stress response system during pregnancy. If essential fatty acid supplementation is associated with reductions in the experience of stress, more modulated hormonal response to stress, and more optimal regulation of emotion and attention in the infant, even within the context inner-city poverty, then a comprehensive program of research on the role of nutrition on stress during pregnancy can be launched. This study may be the first step toward broad-based prevention of poor developmental outcomes among children born to women living in poverty.            Project Narrative This will be the first study of the effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in pregnant women living in inner-city poverty on the stress response system during pregnancy.

"Cells to Society (C2s): The Center on Social Disparities and Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The three signature themes guiding our research are: social disparities, stress, and health; families, interpersonal relationships, and health; and developmental perspectives on health disparities from conception through adulthood. The goals of our proposed activities are to: (i) become an international locus for information about and training in the use of biomarkers in population research; (ii) expand and strengthen our signature programs of population research; (iii) initiate new types of interdisciplinary, collaborative research projects that span the social and life sciences; (iv) mentor and develop young scientists; (v) increase external funding; and (vi) translate research findings for practice and policy. With regard to biomarkers, C2S faculty would expand their work on development of ""field-friendly"" methods for assessing biomarkers of human health and development. Key goals are to develop methods for assaying new biomarkers, provide technical assistance for incorporating these methods into national and community surveys, and, through an annual summer workshop, train students and faculty in using and analyzing biomarker data in population surveys. With regard to new research activities, our focus in social disparities and health include cross-national studies of stress and culture, studies of racial and ethnic disparities in the U.S., biologically-based studies of stress and psychological health, and studies of stress and socioeconomic elements of both families and neighborhoods. Our focus on interpersonal relationships and health includes studies of family stress and child well-being, and prejudice and stereotyping in inter-group relations. Our focus on developmental perspectives on health include studies of how prenatal and neo-natal environments affect child well-being and adult health, and developmental influences on adult reproductive function. Consistent throughout our proposed work is the emphasis on population-level health and well-being through the use, where possible, of representative samples from target populations of interest. Our research-based mentoring and curriculum-based instruction will train a new cadre of young researchers whose mastery of both biological and population-based methods will equip them to engage in the kind of integrative, multi- method, interdisciplinary approaches to population health research envisioned by the NIH Roadmap.

"The Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma from Terror: A Developmental Perspec    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed work addresses a key goal of NIMH Program Announcement PA-07-312, which seeks to enhance scientific understanding about the etiology of psychopathology related to violence and trauma"". The almost 4000 missiles that fell within Northern Israel in the summer of 2006, the damage suffered by property and persons, and the confinement of many families in bomb shelters during the terror period created a unique 'naturalistic' laboratory for assessing the effects of PTSD caused by exposure to a circumscribed period of terror. Within this context, we will examine the health and behavior of fetuses and birth parameters of pregnant women who were residents of the North at the time of the war and test for gene and environmental moderation of fetal and birth measures. We will study two groups: (1) 150 women who are residents of cities attacked during the ""war"" and who meet full criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of their exposure to attacks, and (2) 150 women from the same cohort, who show no symptoms of PTSD. The study will be the first study to examine fetal health and behavior in pregnant women with PTSD and the first study to test for gene-based vulnerabilities and Gene x Environment on these measures. The study speaks to the impact of terror induced PTSD on fetal development, the potential transmission of biological events associated with PTSD from mother to fetus, and environmental and genetic factors that may exacerbate fetal risk. The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1. Fetal health and behavior will be adversely affected by maternal PTSD. Hypothesis 1 asserts that fetuses of mothers exposed to terror and suffer from PTSD will show signs of poorer health (stunted fetal growth measures, atypical reactivity and regulation of heart rate and torso/limb movement to challenge, and complications) and poorer birth/neonatal parameters (birth weight, head circumference, gestational age at delivery, and complications) than women who were exposed to terror, but who do not develop PTSD. We also predict an association between posttraumatic stress symptoms and outcome measures, across the sample. Aim 2. Psychosocial stresses and maternal depression predict fetal health, behavior, and stress reactivity and regulation. Hypothesis 2 posits that, among women with PTSD, psychosocial stressors (life events, chronic stressors) and maternal depression will add significant risk to their fetus. Hypothesis 3 predicts that, in the full sample, psychosocial stress and maternal depression will moderate the effects of maternal PTSD. Aim 3. Analyses of candidate gene associations with fetal/neonatal outcomes. We will evaluate the association between offspring's genotype (indexed by a battery of candidate genes) and fetal/neonatal outcomes. Hypothesis 4 predicts that variants of these genes will have main effects on infant outcomes. Hypothesis 5 predicts we will find gene-environment interactions as follows: a) risk variants implicated in hypothesis 4 will moderate the impact that mothers' PTSD and mother's psychosocial stress each have on fetal/neonatal outcomes (i.e., we expect to observe gene-environment interactions).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PARAGRAPH: The violence outside the home, as experienced in some US communities (sporadic and frequent) can affect anyone near by. Information regarding the relation between exposure to violence and PTSD on fetal development and birth outcome is important for understanding the processes that can promote developmental risk in communities with such violence. In this regard, the distribution of adverse reproductive health outcomes in the US and other developed nations is characterized by large racial/ethic disparities (Anachebe 2003). In the US, an almost two-fold disparity persists in the rate of premature birth between African American and non-Hispanic White women, even after accounting for obstetric, socio demographic, and behavioral risk factors (Collins & Hammond 1996; MacDorman et al 2002); and it has been suggested that differences in risk may be related to variations in stress and stress physiology (Wadwa et al 2001). The results of the proposed study, which examines genetic and environmental risk in relation to fetal health, can further understanding of individual differences in psycho- neuroendocrine processes that underlie or contribute to the risk of pre maturity and adverse neurodevelopment, and both represent major public health issues in the US.          ",The Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma from Terror: A Developmental Perspec,7891254,R01HD053586,"['Individual Differences ', ' Trauma ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' infant outcome ', ' public health relevance ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Fetus ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Chronic ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' indexing ', ' Israel ', ' Laboratories ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' Head circumference ', ' Mothers ', ' Persons ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Genetic ', ' Physiology ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Exposure to ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Life ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' War ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' fetal ', ' psychosocial ', ' meetings ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' experience ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' limb movement ', ' stressor ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' offspring ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Fetal Growth ', ' intrauterine growth ', ' Measures ', ' Regulation ', ' falls ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Sampling ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Cities ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Outcome ', ' Neonatal ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' ']",NICHD,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2010,403781,0.06002645186025938
"Race-based social stress and health trajectories from adolescence to adulthood    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad aim of this Grand Opportunity Grant is to understand how race-based social stress, racial/ethnic (R/E) identity, and biological functioning contribute to health and healthy aging. Using the Maryland Adolescent Development in Context Study (MADICS) we propose to complement existing psychosocial, mental, and physical health data with the collection of a comprehensive set of measures of biological systems intimately tied to health and disease and highly relevant to the aging processes. MADICS is a nationally-recognized 17- year longitudinal study of family, school, neighborhood, and peer influences on the healthy and successful development of an initial sample of 1482 early adolescents and their families (60% African American, 35% European American, and similar proportions of ""middle class"" SES within these groups). Measures gathered across seven waves of data collection (ages 12 to 30) include histories of perceived discrimination based on race/ethnicity; beliefs, behaviors, and feelings about one's perceived R/E classification (i.e., R/E identity); mental and physical health; and psychosocial functioning (e.g., educational and occupational attainment). Here we propose to add a wide range of measures of biological systems associated with health and disease and highly relevant to the prospective study of aging processes. The primary goal is to explore how developmental histories of discrimination contribute to the pre-disease and health states of approximately 300 young adults (approximately 32 years old) and the extent to which these relations vary by R/E classification, SES, and R/E identity. Specifically, we will assess (1) the basal functioning of multiple physiological systems (endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, inflammatory, sleep) reflecting well-established risk factors for a variety of poor health outcomes; (2) the acute reactivity and recovery of three physiological response systems tied to the development of chronic disease (i.e., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal [HPA] axis, autonomic nervous system, inflammatory system) in the context of a daily diary study and also in an experimental setting in which we expose individuals to a discriminatory episode; (3) inflammatory cytokine production and immune cell resistance to the anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids, gene expression profiling of leukocytes to identify broad groups of genes associated with social stress (e.g., inflammation-related genes), and bioinformatic analyses to identify transcriptional control pathways that might potentially mediate these effects; and (4) person-centered health trajectory profiles constructed from mental and physical health and the proposed biomarkers and the extent to which their relations to histories of discrimination are moderated by R/E classification, SES, R/E identity, and parent socialization factors. An additional aim of this grant is to develop methods that can become part of the toolkit of future field-based health and aging researchers (e.g., validation of the measurement of TNF-alpha and IL6 in Oral Mucosal Transudate and the development of a field-friendly stress reactivity protocol that can be conducted in a mobile psychophysiological van).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disparities in health associated with racial/ethnic classification persist in the US. The elimination of such health disparities is of paramount importance for public health. Understanding factors associated with health disparities is critical for their elimination. This application includes studies that focus on better understanding the biological, psychological, and social factors that contribute to health disparities.           Disparities in health associated with racial/ethnic classification persist in the US.

"Social Influences on Early Adult Stress Biomarkers The goal of our project is to conduct a population-level investigation of social contexts, stress, and health. We integrate multiple biomarkers of stress with current theory and measurement tools from the social and behavioral sciences to gain a better understanding of how social contexts ""get under the skin"" to affect stress and health in young adults. We use data from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) in pursuit of three objectives: 1) Examine the interrelations among multiple subjective and physiological measures of stress; 2) Investigate how measures of socio-economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships in childhood/adolescence and over the transition to adulthood influence stress in early adulthood; and 3) Test competing theoretical models of the joint influence of socio- economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships on stress. We examine subjective measures of stress, including perceived stress, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of anxiety, as well as physiological measures of endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and inflammatory activity. We take advantage of the breadth and depth of the Add Health dataset to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date of how social stress affects physical and mental health. Additionally, the large sample size and racial, ethnic, and economic diversity of Add Health allow us to investigate the extent to which stress leads to health disparities. Stress is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, and investigating the physiological mechanisms through which social contexts affect human health can help investigators, clinicians, and policy makers to: a) identify adverse psychosocial environments; b) better understand predisease and disease pathways; and c) inform interventions to reduce exposure to stressors, reduce the adverse impact of stressors on physiology, and prevent the emergence of stress-related disorders.

"Physiological reactivity to acute stress during pregnancy    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preterm delivery, an increasingly frequent occurrence in the United States, is associated with significant family burden and an estimated societal cost of at least $26 billion per year. In the U.S., the preterm birth rate is 12-13% as compared to 5-9% in other developed countries. Persistent racial disparities contribute to this discrepancy. Psychosocial stress and related physiological sequelae may contribute to preterm birth overall, as well as to racial disparities in preterm birth. The experience of chronic stress, such as that conferred by racial minority status, may sensitize physiological stress responses. Indeed, as compared to Caucasians, African-Americans exhibit greater cardiovascular reactivity to a variety of acute stressors. Importantly, blood pressure, glucocorticoid, and catecholamine responses to acute stress are attenuated during healthy pregnancy as compared to nonpregnancy. This adaptation may protect the mother and fetus from potentially detrimental effects of maternal physiological activation. Thus, women who exhibit greater and more extended physiological reactions to everyday stressors may be at increased risk for negative perinatal outcomes. Notably, no studies of acute stress during pregnancy have examined inflammatory immune responses or mechanisms underlying blood pressure change (i.e., cardiac output, total peripheral resistance). Moreover, limited information is available regarding effects of race on physiological adaptation to pregnancy. The current study will address important gaps in the literature by examining cardiovascular, endocrine, and immune reactivity to acute stress among 40 healthy pregnant women (20 Caucasian, 20 African-American) and 40 demographically matched nonpregnant control women. This research is designed to ultimately lead to the identification of women at greater risk for negative perinatal outcomes and elucidation of mechanisms underlying increased risk, providing a basis for individualized health care services. Specific Aim #1: To utilize more comprehensive and advanced methodology to assess physiological reactivity during pregnancy versus nonpregnancy, including measures of inflammation, impedance cardiography, and glucocorticoid receptor function. Hypothesis #1: Pregnant women will show attenuated physiological responses to acute stress as compared to nonpregnant women. Specific Aim #2: To examine racial differences in physiological reactivity during pregnancy versus nonpregnancy. Hypothesis #2: As compared to Caucasian women, African-American women will exhibit greater physiological reactivity to stress during pregnancy and nonpregnancy. Specific Aim #3: To examine psychosocial correlates of physiological reactivity during pregnancy and nonpregnancy. Hypothesis #3: Women reporting greater distress will exhibit greater physiological reactivity during pregnancy and nonpregnancy. Specific Aim #4: To examine associations between physiological reactivity and length of gestation. Hypothesis #4: Greater physiological reactivity to acute stress will predict shorter gestational length. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will fill important gaps in our knowledge regarding physiological adaption during pregnancy and effects of race on such adaptation. Information gained from this study will provide the groundwork for the following: 1) identification of women at greater risk of negative perinatal outcomes; 2) describing physiological mechanisms underlying the link between stress and risk of preterm delivery; and 3) providing interventions designed to reduce the effects of stress and promote healthy pregnancy and fetal development.            PROJECT NARRATIVE  This study will fill important gaps in our knowledge regarding physiological adaption during pregnancy and effects of race on such adaptation.

"Hypertension in Black Americans: Environment, Behavior, and Biology    Description (provided by applicant): Hypertension (HTN) is a major health problem for Black Americans: as a group they have the highest rate of HTN in the world. HTN develops at younger ages, is more severe, and leads to more adverse clinical outcomes and higher death rates for Blacks than for Whites. Chronic psychosocial stressors (e.g., daily hassles, racial discrimination and financial strain) are believed to contribute to the development of HTN. The purposes of the proposed mentored patient-oriented research career development award are to provide the necessary training experiences so that the candidate can achieve independence as an investigator conducting biobehavioral research and to begin to address the question of why some Blacks develop HTN while other Blacks do not. The training goals are to 1) expand knowledge of cardiovascular physiology and pathological mechanisms leading to HTN; 2) obtain expertise in the assessment of psychosocial stress and the integration of measures of psychosocial stress with physiological indices of stress; 3) obtain expertise in impedance-derived measurement of total peripheral resistance and to become skilled in the assessment of cardiovascular and neuroendocrine responses to acute laboratory-based stressors; 4) become proficient in the design, conduct and analysis of longitudinal studies and associated advanced statistical methods; and 5) disseminate results of research and develop a fundable R01 proposal. The candidate will engage in a 3-year intensive, supervised career development plan that will include: a) formal course work in HTN, stress, and advanced research methods; b) hands-on laboratory experiences with her mentors, consultants, and specialists; c) interdisciplinary experiences such as journal clubs, seminars, and conferences; and d) participation in mentors' research team meetings. To compliment the training, the candidate will conduct a study to examine factors related to HTN in 128 Black men and women between the ages of 25 and 55. The study will compare Blacks with and without HTN for differences in indicators of allostatic load (sleep blood pressure, sleep total peripheral resistance, cortisol awakening response, and obesity); in chronic psychosocial stressors (daily hassles, racial discrimination, and financial strain); and in the moderating effect of positive and negative emotions, religious coping, and John Henryism active coping on the influence of chronic psychosocial stressors on indicators of allostatic load.

"A Mindfulness-based Intervention to Reduce Diabetes Risk in Prediabetic Afr-Ameri DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-diabetes, characterized by glucose levels that are above normal but below the diagnostic criteria for diabetes, is an increasingly common condition affecting approximately 54 million U.S. adults. African Americans are disproportionately affected by pre-diabetes and experience high rates of diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality including damage to the circulatory system, kidneys, and nervous system. Patients with pre-diabetes who increase their physical activity and improve their diets have reduced risk of developing diabetes. Psychological distress negatively influences the course of the disease by increasing deleterious health behaviors; preventing scheduling and maintenance of positive behavior change; and stimulating HPA- axis activation and dysregulation, which may have a direct impact on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. African Americans may have increased exposure to stress and increased vulnerability to adverse stress-related health outcomes like diabetes, because of their unique history, socio-cultural experiences, and societal position in the U.S. Helping individuals to reduce stress and to increase healthy coping strategies may enhance conventional diabetes prevention efforts, especially among African Americans. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a mind-body practice with a wide range of health benefits, has been shown to result in statistically significant reductions in psychological stress and anxiety in randomized, controlled studies. Mindfulness training is cost-effective in comparison with other small-group or individualized programs, and can be taught safely and effectively by well-trained instructors. There is little research, and no randomized, controlled trials of MBSR as a treatment for individuals with pre-diabetes. There is also little research on the acceptability of MBSR program to a pre-diabetic subgroup of African Americans, or on the acceptability of an MBSR program for a general population of African Americans. Overall goals of this exploratory pilot study are to study the potential efficacy of a diabetes prevention education program that includes training in mindfulness-based stress reduction for pre-diabetic African Americans. Specific Aims are 1) to determine the feasibility of developing a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based diabetes prevention program (treatment group) with a conventional diabetes prevention program (control group) in improving glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic African American adults; 2) to identify relevant physiological and psychological secondary outcomes associated with a mindfulness-based, educational self-care program in African Americans with pre-diabetes; 3) to assess the acceptability and cultural relevance of MBSR for pre-diabetic African Americans via a post-intervention qualitative study, to include interviews of participants, dropouts, and instructors; and 4) to identify, and find solutions for, problems in conducting a well-powered clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a mindfulness-based diabetes prevention program in improving glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic African-Americans.     This project will investigate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of a mind-body intervention, Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), as an adjunct to health education in reducing impaired glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic African Americans. We predict that reduction of stress and improvement in coping resources through training in diabetes education enhanced by MBSR training will positively influence health behaviors and physiological responses to stress, and thus improve pre-diabetic state.",A Mindfulness-based Intervention to Reduce Diabetes Risk in Prediabetic Afr-Ameri,7877934,R21AT004276,"['Data Collection ', ' diabetes risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' dietary lipid ', ' insulin secretion ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dropout ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Mind-Body Intervention ', ' mind body wellness ', ' mind body treatments ', ' mind body therapy ', ' mind body techniques ', ' mind body medicine skills ', ' mind body approach ', ' Mind-Body Medicine (with OBSSR) ', ' Mind-Body Medicine ', ' National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ', ' NCCAM ', ' Subgroup ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Prevention education ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' glucose tolerance ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Distress ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' diabetic ', ' Funding ', ' Maintenance ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity -

"Race/Ethnicity, Psychosocial and Environmental Stressors, and Telomere Length    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to conduct the first community-based study of racial differences in telomere length and allostatic load in adults of broad age range and their association with urban stressors. We hypothesize that chronic stressors experienced by black urban residents accelerate biological aging and chronic disease onset. Evidence suggests that leukocyte telomere length (TL) may be an indicator of biological age that can be affected by stress; and that allostatic load is an indicator of stress-mediated wear on important body systems. We have a unique opportunity to supplement survey data scheduled to be collected by the Healthy Environments Partnership (HEP) a partnership between the University of Michigan and community-based organizations and health service agencies in Detroit with blood collection and lab analyses of telomere length, telomere-related compounds, and allostatic load, including measures of the biological stress response, inflammation, and cardiovascular and metabolic risk. By appending a venous blood draw to the HEP survey, we can construct a data set including these biomeasures and detailed psychosocial and physical environmental measures in a cost-effective way; enhance access to a hard-to-reach population; and facilitate dissemination of study results to improve community health. We will estimate a series of regressions of TL and allostatic load on race, controlling for the confounding effects of age, gender, and socioeconomic characteristics and exploring the extent to which psychosocial or environmental stressors mediate remaining racial differences. To ensure findings are not driven by functional form we will reanalyze the data using matching methods. We will also model disease outcomes, conditional on telomere length, on high oxidative stress or low telomerase activity to explore biological mechanistic pathways between telomere length and chronic disease. Our investigative team brings exceptional expertise in social and behavioral science, cell biology, psychology and biochemistry to insure state-of-the art telomere measurement, theory-driven and statistically sound social science measures and models, and appropriate interpretation of study findings to provide important insights. We expect study findings to shed light on the plausibility of cumulative stress hypotheses to explain the social patterning of disease; the viability of telomere length as a biomeasure of aging; and the mechanistic pathways through which stressors may be linked to telomere length and disease processes. If findings from this interdisciplinary collaborative effort support study hypotheses, this could constitute a significant advance in the understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie racial inequality in health.

"Health Disparities and Stress Hypothesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application argues that progress in understanding the origins of racial and socioeconomic position (SEP) disparities has been impeded by several problems, the two most important of which are the problem of misclassification and the failure to adequately assess differences in stress exposure. In our view, information on the origins of health disparities can most effectively be pursued by an approach that avoids the typical classification error of counting disordered individuals as non-disordered because they do not exhibit the particular disease or disorder under investigation or have a nascent disorder that has not progressed enough to be clinically detectable. We suggest that such misclassification is likely to have obscured potentially modifiable factors that are centrally implicated in the documented elevation in health risk among African Americans and persons of low SEP, and argue that it can be avoided by a joining of biomarker methodologies for estimating physical health status and reliable estimates of the presence of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems within a community-based population study. There is also evidence indicating that the failure of prior research to take account of a range of social stressors has significantly biased estimates of racial and SEP differences in exposure to stress and resulted in the systematic underestimation of the contributions of stress exposure to the occurrence of racial and SEP disparities in health. Among the unique aspects of the proposed research are: 1) the substantial avoidance of epidemiologic misclassification through the simultaneous consideration of one or more operationalizations of allostatic load and the assessment of cell aging, in combination with both clinical and subclinical assessments of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems; 2) estimation of stress exposure in terms of lifetime exposure to major and potential traumatic events, recent life events, chronic stressors, discrimination stress, and, among African Americans, stress arising from colorism and from uncertainty and/or ambiguity associated with covert discrimination; and 3) in the context provided by 1 and 2 above, to assess an exceptionally comprehensive array of hypothesized risk/protective factors including, through a subsequent grant application, gene-environment interactions. We will study a representative community-based sample of 1600 adults, ages 25 to 65 selected such that half are African American, half are female, and sufficient numbers of middle and upper SEP African Americans who do and do not live in segregated areas are included to allow at least substantial disentanglement of the effects of race, SEP, and segregation. The research proposed is aimed toward the identification of potentially modifiable social, contextual, and personal factors that contribute to racial and SEP health disparities.

"RCT of Stress Reduction in the Secondary Prevention of CHD in African Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The broad Challenge Area is: 09 Health Disparities. The specific Challenge Topic is: Develop tools to detect early indicators of health disparities, and to test collaborative interventions to reduce differential health care or outcomes for heart, lung, and blood diseases: 09-HL-101. The mortality rate from cardiovascular disease is twice as high in African Americans as white Americans. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major cause of this health disparity since mortality rates from CHD are 50 percent greater in African American men and women compared to whites. Epidemiological evidence implicates excessive psychosocial and socio-environmental stress in these disproportionate rates of CHD mortality and morbidity. Despite these public health patterns, there have been no previous clinical trials to assess the efficacy of stress reduction training added to standard secondary prevention programs for CHD in high risk African Americans. Previous controlled clinical studies have demonstrated that stress reduction with the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program is associated with reductions in CHD risk factors, surrogate CHD endpoints and clinical cardiovascular events in African American men and women. These beneficial changes include reductions in hypertension, psychosocial stress, insulin resistance-metabolic syndrome, myocardial ischemia, carotid atherosclerosis, left ventricular hypertrophy, and mortality rates. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a highly sensitive and specific noninvasive tool for quantifying changes in coronary artery disease. A preliminary study using cardiac PET in African American subjects with CHD demonstrated the feasibility of using this technology in a phase II trial to determine the efficacy of stress reduction in patients with CHD. Therefore, the overall objective of the present study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation with and without a structured, standardized, and validated stress reduction component in the secondary prevention of CHD in African Americans. In this phase II trial, 56 African American men and women with established CHD will be randomly allocated either to standard cardiac rehabilitation with formal stress reduction training using the Transcendental Meditation program or to standard cardiac rehabilitation alone. The intervention period will be 12 weeks. At baseline and posttest, subjects will be tested by quantitative PET for myocardial perfusion and ischemia. Secondary outcomes comprise physiological, behavioral and psychosocial risk factors for CHD. Participant eligibility criteria and programmatic elements of the intervention programs are consistent with Medicare guidelines for phase II cardiac rehabilitation/secondary prevention. The field site will be Columbia University Medical Center and the coordinating center will be MUMRI-Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention. This study will be the first of its kind to directly evaluate the contributions of stress reduction training to the secondary prevention of CHD in African American men and women with documented heart disease. African Americans suffer from two-fold higher rates of mortality from cardiovascular disease compared to the majority population. Substantial evidence indicates that disproportionately high levels of psychosocial and environmental stress contribute to this public health disparity. This will be the first clinical trial to evaluate the usefulness of stress reduction combined with standard cardiac care compared to standard cardiac care alone in modifying the heart disease process in African American men and women with known coronary heart disease.                    Project Narrative African Americans suffer from two-fold higher rates of mortality from cardiovascular disease compared to the majority population.

"Causes and Impact of Minority Stress on Health and Development in Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual orientation group disparities in several critical health domains are now well documented, with sexual minorities reporting more psychological distress, substance use and dependence, and eating disorders symptoms. Little is known about the reasons underlying higher risk behaviors among sexual minorities relative to heterosexuals. Herein, we propose to explain these sexual orientation disparities by testing our Sexual Minority Stress Theory (SMST). SMST is based on society's stigmatization of homosexuality. Gay-related stress, the experience by a sexual-minority individual of society's stigmatization, consists of external stressors (such as prejudice, discrimination, verbal abuse, physical violence) perpetrated by known individuals (such as kin, heterosexual friends) and strangers in the community. Gay-related stress also consists of internal stress, in which the sexual-minority individual internalizes society's stigmatization, such as possessing negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Our proposed research will address the impact of gay-related stress on disparities between and among sexual orientation subgroups in psychological distress, physiological distress (cortisol, DHEA), health behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood, and examine moderators, such as the effect of parent-child relationships on the relations between sexual orientation and gay-related stress and the effect of coping on the relations between gay-related stress and both psychological and physiological distress. Gay-related stress may be particularly important in influencing a sexual minority youth's development and psychosocial adjustment in emerging adulthood. Our research will be sensitive to important precursors of gay-related stress, such as gender nonconformity. It will also examine how sex, age at experiencing gay-related stress, sexual minority status and transitions in status, concordant vs. nonconcordant orientation patterns among sexual minorities, and sexual identity development vary with gay-related stress, health, adaptation, and adjustment outcomes. We will collect new self-report survey and biological data to investigate these critical issues in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal cohort study of 16,882 U.S. adolescents and emerging adults begun in 1996 and ongoing. Specifically, we will add 3 data collection phases to more than 10 years of data collected from GUTS and link the youths' data with those of their mothers, who comprise the Nurses' Health Study II. We will examine disparities in violence victimization in childhood and adolescence and other forms of gay-related stress and the impact of these over time on subsequent psychological and physiological distress, substance use and eating disordered behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disturbing evidence exists of disparities in tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use and dependence, eating disorder symptoms, and a number of other important health indicators adversely affecting sexual-minority youth relative to heterosexual peers. Our proposed research will address the critical need for new epidemiologic investigations into the impact of violence victimization, harassment, and other gay- related stressors on the health of this underserved and understudied population, providing valuable data to researchers and clinicians working to improve the health of all youth.           Public Health Relevance: Disturbing evidence exists of disparities in tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use and dependence, eating disorder symptoms, and a number of other important health indicators adversely affecting sexual-minority youth relative to heterosexual peers.

"Stress, Lead, Iron Deficiency and Neurodevelopment Social stressors, iron deficiency anemia, and lead exposure are all environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopment in young children. All three factors are highly prevalent in poor communities, whether in Mexico or the U.S. There are scant human epidemiologic studies on chronic social stress and human neurodevelopment. In addition, previous studies of child development and neurotoxicants have typically analyzed covariate markers of social stress as independent predictors of neurodevelopment; and thus, only considered social factors as potential confounders in their data analysis. There are biological reasons to believe that stress potentiates the toxicity of iron deficiency anemia and lead poisoning. If so, then understanding this relationship may be the key to designing effective public health interventions designed to improve neurodevelopment and may explain the lack of effectiveness of prevention/treatment regimens for lead poisoning and iron deficiency. A prospective cohort study with a large sample size is needed to address the potential multiplicative effects of combined stress/iron deficiency anemia and combined stress/lead exposure in predicting infant development.  This resubmission includes new data from a pilot study of stress-lead/stress-anemia interactions in 120 mother infant pairs conducted since the prior application, which demonstrates study feasibility and evidence for the hypothesized interactions. In this proposal we will measure maternal stress levels, infant iron deficiency anemia and lead exposure in a cohort of mother-infant pairs living in Mexico City and longitudinally measure maternal stress, iron stores, lead exposure, salivary cortisol and neurodevelopment beginning pre-natally and extending 3 years post-partum. This project will determine the independent effect of pre- and post-partum maternal stress in predicting infant development, and the multiplicative joint effects of maternal stress/iron deficiency and maternal stress/lead poisoning in predicting infant development.

"Tools for Measuring and Analyzing Cortisol Levels in Population Studies of Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in health by socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity have been documented for numerous health outcomes. Developing a more comprehensive understanding of the reasons for health disparities that integrates factors defined at multiple levels (e.g. from community-level or neighborhood processes to biological factors) and that explicates common or interrelated processes that generate disparities in multiple health conditions remains a major challenge. This is important not only to understand the etiology of multiple diseases, but also to develop strategies to eliminate health disparities. One process that has been hypothesized to contribute to disparities in multiple health domains is psychosocial stress. It has been argued that exposure to psychosocial stressors repeatedly over long periods has biological consequences with implications for multiple health conditions, including outcomes as diverse as low birth weight, asthma, and cardiovascular disease. Two major challenges in studying the role of psychosocial stress include the (1) measurement and characterization of biological markers of the stress response (2) examining how this complex biological response varies as a function of higher-level (or upstream) determinants such as socioeconomic position and community characteristics. We propose to address both challenges through the development of methodological tools necessary to characterize and analyze biomarkers of the stress response (specifically cortisol profiles) in population-based studies. The overall goal of our project is to improve the methodological tools and data collection protocols necessary to understand how upstream determinants (such as neighborhood-level factors) trigger biological processes (specifically the stress response) that may generate disparities in multiple disease outcomes in the population. We will use a unique multilevel dataset to investigate the use of different methodological approaches in order to make specific recommendations regarding (a) data collection protocols for salivary cortisol data (specifically regarding number and timing of samples) and (b) data analyses involving cortisol profiles as outcomes or predictors The specific aims of our project are: (1) To investigate and contrast statistical methods useful in characterizing different features of the biological stress response, as assessed by repeat measures of salivary cortisol. (2) To examine measurement properties of the features of the cortisol curve in order to be able to make specific recommendations regarding the best data collection tools and protocols in future studies and (3) To investigate and contrast methods useful in examining how features of the stress response curve are related to neighborhood and individual-level predictors as well as to individual-level outcomes. Addressing these Aims will improve the tools available to researchers to study how communities and neighborhoods trigger biological processes in humans that relate to health disparities in the population (one of the stated aims of this RFA). Relevance Persistent and pronounced differences in health by race/ethnicity (often termed health disparities) and by socioeconomic position have been documented for many different health outcomes. The reasons for these disparities remain a subject for research. Psychosocial factors have been hypothesized to be important contributors to these disparities but the tools available to characterize and analyze the biologic consequences of psychosocial stress remain limited. By developing tools necessary to measure and analyze biologic markers of the stress response, our project will contribute to the study for the reasons for health disparities in multiple health outcomes.

"Perinatal Programming of Infant Stress Reactivity and the Atopic Phenotype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biological hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli is a fundamental feature of atopy, predisposing individuals to a spectrum of disorders, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic asthma. Evidence linking psychological stress to atopy expression has grown with our increased understanding of the natural history and pathophysiology of atopic disorders and the neurobiology of stress. However, the specific pathways involved remain to be elucidated in human studies. Findings suggest that stressors may influence pathogenesis by causing dysregulated biobehavioral states (e.g., depression, PTSD), which exert effects on physiological processes that influence disease risk. Extreme forms of stress exposure (multiple stressors within the same time period, chronic stressors over developmental periods, traumatic events) are more likely to lead to persistent psychological and physiological alterations. Disturbed regulation of endocrine and autonomic systems (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system) may modulate offspring immune functioning beginning in utero. Therefore, understanding maternal dysregulation of these systems in pregnancy may be particularly informative. Non-optimal early caregiving experiences (e.g., maternal psychopathology, maternal insensitivity) may also impact these processes by leading to disrupted infant emotion regulation and neuroimmune development, setting the stage for altered reactivity to stimuli and inflammatory processes, hallmarks of early atopy. Exploring these links may be particularly relevant in urban populations, who are disproportionately burdened by both stress and chronic atopic disorders. We will examine the effects of maternal stress (cumulative perinatal stress, lifetime trauma), on the expression of child atopy in an urban sample (N=275). We will incorporate strategies for studying stress reactivity during pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood to elucidate pathways from stress to a hierarchy of early intermediate phenotypes that may be related to persistent atopic disorders (early sensitization as indexed by IgE expression and skin test reactivity, T-helper cell differentiation, airway resistance, early clinical phenotypes). We will examine how intervening processes may affect these relationships, including how maternal-fetal endocrine indicators of stress (prenatal cortisol, corticotrophin-releasing hormone), pre/postnatal maternal psychological functioning, and postnatal caregiving behaviors impact the infant stress response (cortisol, respiration, sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic functioning), assessed during a standardized laboratory protocol at age 6 months, and child atopic profiles assessed through 30 months. In this prospective design, we will examine how fetal stress exposure may influence early neuroimmune development and how such effects are independent of or moderated by postnatal factors. We will test the contributions of proximal and lifetime stress exposures on the proposed pathways. The study findings may identify mechanisms that lead to and maintain early predisposition to costly pediatric atopic disorders, informing more efficacious prevention and intervention strategies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study may increase our understanding of the effects of perinatal maternal stress on vulnerability to early intermediate phenotypes that may predispose to subsequent risk for developing atopic disorders in childhood. Such knowledge may inform efforts to design programs to prevent the development of atopic disorders, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema, particularly in high-risk urban populations. Given the enormous cost in the management of atopic patients in the United States, understanding the earliest stages of development offers significant potential benefits to society.           Statement of Public Health Significance: This study may increase our understanding of the effects of perinatal maternal stress on vulnerability to early intermediate phenotypes that may predispose to subsequent risk for developing atopic disorders in childhood.

"Stress reactivity, cortisol, and obesity in low-income children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low-income children are significantly more likely to be obese, experience chronic stress, and have difficulty self-regulating their emotions and behavior in response to stress. Socioeconomic disparities in obesity begin in early childhood and track throughout the lifespan, but the etiology of such differences is unclear. One way that stress is hypothesized to ""get under the skin"" is via changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), or ""stress"" axis and patterns of cortisol secretion. Under conditions of chronic stress, such as poverty, aberrations in both the normal diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion and cortisol reactivity to stress occur. Obese, compared to non-obese, adults often show such aberrations. Young children living in poverty can also often demonstrate aberrant patterns of cortisol secretion in response to stress; yet, no study has examined links between stress, cortisol, self-regulation, and obesity in low-income children. Studying how the cycle of poverty, stress, and obesity begins early in life is vital, because once established, obesity typically persists. We propose to build on our existing Challenge Grant parent study of diurnal cortisol patterns, eating behavior and obesity in Head Start children (NIH 1RC1DK086376-01, Cortisol and Eating Behavior in Low-Income Preschool-Aged Children, Principal Investigator Lumeng) to investigate associations between poor emotional and behavioral self-regulation and increased obesity risk. We will specifically examine aberrant patterns of cortisol reactivity to stress as a mediator of such associations in this unique cohort of young, low-income children. We are an interdisciplinary team that studies biologic, psychological, and behavioral processes in order to examine the complex relationships among stress, cortisol, self-regulation, and obesity. Improved understanding of associations between self-regulation and obesity in low-income preschool-aged children will provide new points for targeted obesity prevention and intervention programs for young children that focus on self-regulatory skills. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine potential associations. Specific aims are, among 250 low-income 3- to 5-year old children: Aim 1: Examine the association between self-regulation and child body mass index (BMI) z-score. Aim 2: Examine the association between patterns of cortisol reactivity to stress and child BMI z-score. Aim 3: Examine cortisol stress reactivity patterns as a mediator of the association between self-regulation and child BMI z-score. Aim 4: Examine change in BMI z-score (over 18 months) in relation to these variables, and to predictors from our Challenge Grant parent study (e.g., diurnal salivary cortisol pattern, comfort food intake, emotional eating). Study results will have implications for understanding mechanisms of self-regulation, stress, cortisol, and obesity in young children in relation to the early emergence of health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disparities in obesity begin in early childhood and track throughout the lifespan, but the etiology of such differences is unclear. Aberrations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), or ""stress"" axis, and cortisol production in response to stress is suggested as one way for stress to ""get under the skin"" and lead to adverse health outcomes such as obesity in chronically stressed, impoverished populations. Altered cortisol patterns are also seen in children with emotional and behavioral self-regulation difficulties. We will examine associations between poor self-regulation and increased obesity risk, and test whether cortisol reactivity to stress mediates such associations, in a sample of 250 low-income preschool-aged children. Results have implications for understanding mechanisms of self-regulation, stress, and obesity in young children, and how early health disparities may arise.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic disparities in obesity begin in early childhood and track throughout the lifespan, but the etiology of such differences is unclear.

"Mindfulness skills training: An innovative approach to stress reduction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes a feasibility study to develop and test an innovative program for stress management, delivered with new technology, among low socioeconomic status (SES) workers at risk for chronic stress and poor health outcomes. Chronic stress over-activates adaptive stress responses, dysregulates self-regulatory mechanisms, and diverts resources away from health maintenance functions, resulting in higher rates of illness and early death. Greater than 1/2 of U.S. workers report high levels of job-related stress (e.g., high job-related demands & low wages). Nurse aides (NAs) in long-term care, with high job-related demands and low wages, provide one excellent example of low (SES) workers at risk for chronic stress and poor health outcomes. Workplace stress management has been named as a national priority. But, existing programs are diverse and have not consistently improved outcomes. Researchers have yet to identify evidence-based practices for effective stress management. Research supports the efficacy of a) mindfulness interventions on health-related outcomes and b) behavioral and informational interventions delivered by technology to low-income populations. Based on self-regulation theory, the proposed mindfulness skills training (MST) intervention is an innovative approach to stress management for workers. This is because it will increase accessibility and affordability of the intervention among low SES workers like (NAs) by delivery via new technology (i.e., MP3 players). Measures of perceived stress, coping behaviors, and signs and symptoms will be measured pre- and post-intervention, and at 1 month follow-up. My hypotheses are: Mindfulness will be correlated with 1) perceived stress, 2) physical symptoms, and 3) physiological signs of stress (e.g., BP). These scores will also be associated with changes in moods (greater positive, less negative) and coping behaviors (greater acceptance, less avoidance). The purposes of this study are to: 1) Evaluate the feasibility of the MST program delivered to NAs in a long-term care setting and 2) Explore the relationship of mindfulness (e.g., attention and awareness) to perceived stress and psychological, physical, behavioral and physiological responses to stress. Consistent with the NINR mission, this proposed study promises to develop and test an innovative bio-behavioral self-management intervention delivered via new technology. Findings will be to refine a future intervention, related measures, and in the design of a randomized controlled trial for low SES workers. For public: MST is one creative approach for managing stress more effectively that could be especially relevant to low SES workers and could improve their health outcomes.          ",Mindfulness skills training: An innovative approach to stress reduction,7920205,F31NR010986,"['Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Low income ', ' Economics ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' Feasibility Studies ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' post intervention ', ' Individual ', ' Long-Term Care ', ' extended care ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Policies ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Names ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', "" Nurses' Aides "", ' Nursing Auxiliaries ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Smoking ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Attention ', ' Work ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Awareness ', ' Endocrine ', ' skills training ', ' Agreement ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Self Management ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' evidence base ', ' mindfulness ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2010,21266,0.16756221533570614
"Perceived Fairness and Biological Stress Reactivity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Beliefs about fairness are a clinically significant predictor of cardiovascular health. Fairness beliefs are fundamentally important to cardiovascular health through their capacity to impact biological stress processes. However, the extent to which specific kinds of fairness beliefs influence important biological stress pathways is largely unknown. Ultimately, these limitations have impeded the capacity of researchers to better understand how fairness is implicated in cardiovascular illness, and also to evaluate fairness-oriented cardiovascular interventions. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the role played by fairness in cardiovascular health, and to determine whether fairness is a common causal process linking such other risk factors as racism, low SES, and work stress to subsequent biological mediators of cardiovascular illness. The objective of this application is to experimentally elucidate relationships between specific measurements of fairness beliefs and multiple biological stress pathways. The central hypothesis of this application is that procedural and distributive fairness will independently and interdependently predict more adaptive biological stress reactivity. In addition, we expect that these relationships will be reflected in both trait dispositions and situational judgments of fairness, and also in multiple biological and disease relevant stress pathways. The specific aims are to 1) measure the unique and interactive contributions of distributive (favorable outcomes) and procedural (treatment by others) fairness on biological stress reactivity; 2) measure the unique and interactive contributions of dispositional (trait) and situationally induced (state) fairness on biological stress reactivity; 3) measure relationships between fairness beliefs and important biological stress pathways, including markers of hemodynamic reactivity, HPA axis arousal, and pro-inflammatory processes. The proposed research will administer a modified version of a well established and laboratory-based stress induction paradigm. In doing so, this research will experimentally evaluate associations between specific kinds of fairness beliefs and multiple biological stress pathways. The public health implication of the project is significant. Namely, the proposed research will provide an important step towards defining disease relevant models, and for targeting and evaluating psychosocial interventions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Beliefs about fairness predict both stress reactivity and incidence of cardiovascular illness.

"Air pollution, stress and urban child development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasingly, prospective epidemiological studies link maternal stress during pregnancy with adverse neurodevelopment in children. Recent evidence also suggests that perinatal ambient air pollution exposure may have neurotoxic effects. While historically research has focused on how social and physical environmental factors independently affect children's health, evolving research underscores the importance of studying interactive effects. Moreover, marginalized populations of lower-socioeconomic position (SEP) are exposed disproportionately to traffic- related pollutants while living in adverse social circumstances or communities that are ""socially"" toxic. Consequently, these populations experience both increased stress and increased chemical pollution. Social x chemical interactions may account for more variance in explaining risk than the main effects of either factor alone. Relevant studies in urban populations are rare and none assess stress and air pollution together. Studies of mechanistic pathways linking perinatal air pollution and/or stress to neurodevelopment are equally sparse. We take advantage of an established pregnancy cohort - the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS) project (R01 HL080674, RJ Wright PI), with prospectively characterized exposure to ambient pollutants starting in pregnancy coupled with extensive assessment of pre- and postnatal stress, as well as relevant confounders and mediators. We can draw from our biomarker archive including assessments of prenatal maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (e.g., cortisol), infant autonomic nervous system (ANS) and HPA axis function at age 6 months, and DNA banked for future genetic assays to explore mechanisms. In this application, we are proposing the addition of neurocognitive and behavioral testing in n=815 ACCESS children at age 6 years. We will then test the main effects of perinatal exposure to chronic ambient air pollution and/or psychological stress on these neuropsychiatric outcomes. We will next examine whether air pollution effects are modified by psychosocial stress. Mechanisms to be explored include perinatal stress (& air pollution)-elicited disruption in the maternal prenatal HPA axis and the child's HPA axis and ANS response. Finally, to further explore biological mechanisms by which air pollutants and stress impact neurodevelopment, genetic susceptibility factors will be examined.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the effects of perinatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution on childhood neurobehavioral and cognitive development in urban children. In addition to independent effects of air pollution, the study will also examine the potential modifying effects of the social environment (i.e., psychological stress) and genetic susceptibility on these relationships. Such knowledge may inform efforts to design programs that improve neurodevelopmental trajectories in high-risk urban populations disproportionately exposed to adverse physical and social environments.           Statement of Public Health Significance: This study will examine the effects of perinatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution on childhood neurobehavioral and cognitive development in urban children.

"Stress reactivity, cortisol, and obesity in low-income children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Low-income children are significantly more likely to be obese, experience chronic stress, and have difficulty self-regulating their emotions and behavior in response to stress. Socioeconomic disparities in obesity begin in early childhood and track throughout the lifespan, but the etiology of such differences is unclear. One way that stress is hypothesized to ""get under the skin"" is via changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), or ""stress"" axis and patterns of cortisol secretion. Under conditions of chronic stress, such as poverty, aberrations in both the normal diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion and cortisol reactivity to stress occur. Obese, compared to non-obese, adults often show such aberrations. Young children living in poverty can also often demonstrate aberrant patterns of cortisol secretion in response to stress; yet, no study has examined links between stress, cortisol, self-regulation, and obesity in low-income children. Studying how the cycle of poverty, stress, and obesity begins early in life is vital, because once established, obesity typically persists. We propose to build on our existing Challenge Grant parent study of diurnal cortisol patterns, eating behavior and obesity in Head Start children (NIH 1RC1DK086376-01, Cortisol and Eating Behavior in Low-Income Preschool-Aged Children, Principal Investigator Lumeng) to investigate associations between poor emotional and behavioral self-regulation and increased obesity risk. We will specifically examine aberrant patterns of cortisol reactivity to stress as a mediator of such associations in this unique cohort of young, low-income children. We are an interdisciplinary team that studies biologic, psychological, and behavioral processes in order to examine the complex relationships among stress, cortisol, self-regulation, and obesity. Improved understanding of associations between self-regulation and obesity in low-income preschool-aged children will provide new points for targeted obesity prevention and intervention programs for young children that focus on self-regulatory skills. Structural equation modeling will be used to examine potential associations. Specific aims are, among 250 low-income 3- to 5-year old children: Aim 1: Examine the association between self-regulation and child body mass index (BMI) z-score. Aim 2: Examine the association between patterns of cortisol reactivity to stress and child BMI z-score. Aim 3: Examine cortisol stress reactivity patterns as a mediator of the association between self-regulation and child BMI z-score. Aim 4: Examine change in BMI z-score (over 18 months) in relation to these variables, and to predictors from our Challenge Grant parent study (e.g., diurnal salivary cortisol pattern, comfort food intake, emotional eating). Study results will have implications for understanding mechanisms of self-regulation, stress, cortisol, and obesity in young children in relation to the early emergence of health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic disparities in obesity begin in early childhood and track throughout the lifespan, but the etiology of such differences is unclear. Aberrations in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA), or ""stress"" axis, and cortisol production in response to stress is suggested as one way for stress to ""get under the skin"" and lead to adverse health outcomes such as obesity in chronically stressed, impoverished populations. Altered cortisol patterns are also seen in children with emotional and behavioral self-regulation difficulties. We will examine associations between poor self-regulation and increased obesity risk, and test whether cortisol reactivity to stress mediates such associations, in a sample of 250 low-income preschool-aged children. Results have implications for understanding mechanisms of self-regulation, stress, and obesity in young children, and how early health disparities may arise.           PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic disparities in obesity begin in early childhood and track throughout the lifespan, but the etiology of such differences is unclear.

"Role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and social stress on perinatal outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)      The goal of this K99/R00 Career Development Plan is to launch an independent research program in reproductive and environmental epidemiology of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which includes evaluating social determinants of health that may affect overlapping biologic pathways. To accomplish this goal, the candidate will enhance her expertise in environmental health sciences with didactic and hands-on training in reproductive biology, social epidemiology/stress science, and environmental epidemiologic methods. This specialized training will allow her to achieve her long term goal of becoming an independent academic investigator and offering new insights on the cumulative impacts of environmental and social factors on reproductive health.        The primary goal of the candidate's Research Plan is to evaluate the independent effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and psychosocial stress on thyroid hormone disruption and consequent perinatal outcomes among a population of socioeconomically and racially diverse pregnant women. This work is particularly innovative as both PBDEs and psychosocial stress can impact the thyroid system, suggesting a biologic plausibility for interaction; however the two exposures have never been examined simultaneously in a human study.  During the K99 mentored phase, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tracey Woodruff, the candidate will use innovative measures to characterize biologically-relevant exposures to PBDEs and psychosocial stress and their effects on thyroid hormone disruption. Exposure to PBDEs will be assessed using both PBDE congeners as well as their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PBDEs). Psychosocial stress will be evaluated with subjective measures of stress and telomere length, a biomarker of cellular aging that is influenced by psychosocial stress.  In the independent phase, the candidate will apply this knowledge to investigate the independent effects of PBDEs and psychosocial stress on adverse perinatal outcomes, such as gestational hypertension, preterm birth, and low birth weight, and assess whether these effects are mediated via the thyroid system. The integration of this work will enable the candidate to develop the necessary methodological and biological frameworks to examine the combined, and potentially synergistic, effects of environmental and psychosocial factors on perinatal outcomes in future R01 studies.  The candidate is well positioned to accomplish these goals at the University of California, San Francisco, a highly respected research institution, with a strong environmental reproductive health program, a world-renowned faculty with expertise in psychosocial stress, and an extensive biomedical infrastructure.  The primary mentor and co-mentors in reproductive sciences, environmental epidemiology, health disparities, stress science, and biostatistics will guide the process whereby the candidate learn the methods that are required to accomplish the goals set forth in this proposal. This project represents the cutting-edge of health disparities and environmental health research and seeks to answer critical scientific as well as policy-relevant questions for improving the health of vulnerable populations who often face disproportionate and elevated exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors.        Public Health Relevance: The goal of this project is to prepare Dr. Ami Zota to transition to a position as an independent academic investigator in environmental health sciences focusing on the consequence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy and social factors that may affect overlapping biologic pathways.  She will conduct epidemiologic analyses to investigate the effects of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants and psychosocial stress on perinatal outcomes and assess whether these effects are mediated by the thyroid system.  Results from this work will improve pregnancy outcomes and inform public health policy, particularly for vulnerable subpopulations, who often encounter elevated exposures to chemical and non-chemical stressors.              Project Narrative The goal of this project is to prepare Dr. Ami Zota to transition to a position as an independent academic investigator in environmental health sciences focusing on the consequence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy and social factors that may affect overlapping biologic pathways.

"Race/Ethnicity, Psychosocial and Environmental Stressors, and Telomere Length    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to conduct the first community-based study of racial differences in telomere length and allostatic load in adults of broad age range and their association with urban stressors. We hypothesize that chronic stressors experienced by black urban residents accelerate biological aging and chronic disease onset. Evidence suggests that leukocyte telomere length (TL) may be an indicator of biological age that can be affected by stress; and that allostatic load is an indicator of stress-mediated wear on important body systems. We have a unique opportunity to supplement survey data scheduled to be collected by the Healthy Environments Partnership (HEP) a partnership between the University of Michigan and community-based organizations and health service agencies in Detroit with blood collection and lab analyses of telomere length, telomere-related compounds, and allostatic load, including measures of the biological stress response, inflammation, and cardiovascular and metabolic risk. By appending a venous blood draw to the HEP survey, we can construct a data set including these biomeasures and detailed psychosocial and physical environmental measures in a cost-effective way; enhance access to a hard-to-reach population; and facilitate dissemination of study results to improve community health. We will estimate a series of regressions of TL and allostatic load on race, controlling for the confounding effects of age, gender, and socioeconomic characteristics and exploring the extent to which psychosocial or environmental stressors mediate remaining racial differences. To ensure findings are not driven by functional form we will reanalyze the data using matching methods. We will also model disease outcomes, conditional on telomere length, on high oxidative stress or low telomerase activity to explore biological mechanistic pathways between telomere length and chronic disease. Our investigative team brings exceptional expertise in social and behavioral science, cell biology, psychology and biochemistry to insure state-of-the art telomere measurement, theory-driven and statistically sound social science measures and models, and appropriate interpretation of study findings to provide important insights. We expect study findings to shed light on the plausibility of cumulative stress hypotheses to explain the social patterning of disease; the viability of telomere length as a biomeasure of aging; and the mechanistic pathways through which stressors may be linked to telomere length and disease processes. If findings from this interdisciplinary collaborative effort support study hypotheses, this could constitute a significant advance in the understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie racial inequality in health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Learning how social factors work through biological mechanisms to impact health is fundamental to understanding racial health disparities. By studying personal and neighborhood stressors and the health of Detroit residents in an interdisciplinary collaboration, we hope to shed light on this question.                   ","Race/Ethnicity, Psychosocial and Environmental Stressors, and Telomere Length",8078830,R01AG032632,"['F2-Isoprostanes ', ' telomere ', ' Inequality ', ' transdisciplinary collaboration ', ' interdisciplinary collaboration ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' allostatic load ', ' health inequalities ', ' urban poverty area ', ' environmental stressor ', ' Vitamin E ', ' Historical Survey ', ' hypothalamic pituitary axis ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Weather ', ' Differential Mortality ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Social Sciences ', ' Health Services ', ' health care service ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Schedule ', ' Population Study ', ' Psychology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Michigan ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol (17beta)- ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Estradiol ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' stressor ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Deterioration ', ' Generation Effect ', ' Cohort Effect ', ' Telomerase ', ' Biochemistry and Cellular Biology ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' interest ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' disease length ', ' disease duration ', ' illness length ', ' Woman ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Collection ', ' cell biology ', ' Cellular biology ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Population ', ' Environment ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Link ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' base ', ' theories ', ' Sampling ', ' Data ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Scientist ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Physiology ', ' Process ', ' psychosocial ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Risk ', ' Methods ', ' Characteristics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Age ', ' Modeling ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Life ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' behavioral/social science ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Stress ', ' Communities ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' social ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Area ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Knowledge ', ' Collaborations ', ' Measurement ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Learning ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Economics ', ' Metabolic ', ' Gender ', ' insight ', ' population aging ', ' aging population ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' response ', ' Molecular ', ' Inflammation ', ' Research ', ' Affect ', ' Exposure to ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Chronic ', ' Ensure ', ' coping ', ' Venous ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Pattern ', ' Biological Chemistry ', ' Biochemistry ', ' Series ', ' Biological ', ' Aging ', ' experience ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Community Health ', ' Nerve ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Work ', ' sound ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Mediating ', ' Length ', ' Staging ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2011,374754,0.0818827551911081
"The Intergenerational Transmission of Race Disparities in Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am seeking a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in Population Research to achieve the following career goals: 1) to apply my interdisciplinary biodemographic training and emphasis in the underlying biological mechanisms mediating social inequality, stress, and health to studying black-white differences in health outcomes, 2) identify race differences in the persistence and pathways of manifested health disparities, and 3) to initiate interdisciplinary dialogue and program development for training scholars in the social and biological interactions that contribute to disparate health outcomes. My prior training and research in family, mental health, and social inequality, along with my excellent quantitative methodological skills, provide a strong interdisciplinary foundation. A K01 would expand on this groundwork by integrating groundbreaking biodemographic perspectives and techniques measuring how social inequality 'gets under the skin' to make people sick. The proposed training in understanding the biology of stress integrates training with non-human primate and human models, under the supervision of my exceptional mentors and advisory committee. This novel training will place me in a unique position to contribute to an interdisciplinary community of scholars and policy makers regarding the mechanisms through which inequality contributes to health declines in vulnerable populations. My mentors, biodemographer Mark Hayward and medical sociologist Les Whitbeck, will supervise my training and scholarly development. The research plan incorporates coursework in biodemography, psychobiology, and neurobiology, endocrinology, and research methods in human biology. This integrative curricula will be applied to several complementary aspects of the project including implementing 1) a biomarker pilot study on social stressors and biological measures of stress and health in white and black mothers and their offspring, and secondary data analysis 2) examining black-white differences in the pathways of early life course illness onset using the Add-Health, PSID, and NLSY, and 3) the degree to which there are race differences in the intergenerational persistence of disparate health outcomes using the PSID and NLSY. Overall this award will allow me to 1) gain expertise in biodemographic methods and the biology of stress and illness, 2) the protected time needed to complete my research plan applying theory and methodology, 3) to present my results at conferences and publish results in peer reviewed journals and 4) to prepare an innovative R01 grant proposal to initiate my career as an independent scholar. This award will establish me as an independent investigator in biodemography with the knowledge and skills to communicate across disciplines about the etiology of race differences in health and strategies we may use to alleviate such differences.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black-white differences in health outcomes have increased over the last 50 years in the U.S. with blacks being at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. While differences have been described, less is known about 1) the underlying biological processes that contribute to these population based health differences, 2) the contribution of early life course social factors associated with such disparities, and 3) black-white differences in the persistence of these differences across generations.

"Social Influences on Early Adult Stress Biomarkers The goal of our project is to conduct a population-level investigation of social contexts, stress, and health. We integrate multiple biomarkers of stress with current theory and measurement tools from the social and behavioral sciences to gain a better understanding of how social contexts ""get under the skin"" to affect stress and health in young adults. We use data from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) in pursuit of three objectives: 1) Examine the interrelations among multiple subjective and physiological measures of stress; 2) Investigate how measures of socio-economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships in childhood/adolescence and over the transition to adulthood influence stress in early adulthood; and 3) Test competing theoretical models of the joint influence of socio- economic status, neighborhood quality, and interpersonal relationships on stress. We examine subjective measures of stress, including perceived stress, symptoms of depression, and symptoms of anxiety, as well as physiological measures of endocrine, cardiovascular, metabolic, immune, and inflammatory activity. We take advantage of the breadth and depth of the Add Health dataset to conduct the most comprehensive investigation to date of how social stress affects physical and mental health. Additionally, the large sample size and racial, ethnic, and economic diversity of Add Health allow us to investigate the extent to which stress leads to health disparities. Stress is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality, and investigating the physiological mechanisms through which social contexts affect human health can help investigators, clinicians, and policy makers to: a) identify adverse psychosocial environments; b) better understand predisease and disease pathways; and c) inform interventions to reduce exposure to stressors, reduce the adverse impact of stressors on physiology, and prevent the emergence of stress-related disorders.

"Perceived Fairness and Biological Stress Reactivity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Beliefs about fairness are a clinically significant predictor of cardiovascular health. Fairness beliefs are fundamentally important to cardiovascular health through their capacity to impact biological stress processes. However, the extent to which specific kinds of fairness beliefs influence important biological stress pathways is largely unknown. Ultimately, these limitations have impeded the capacity of researchers to better understand how fairness is implicated in cardiovascular illness, and also to evaluate fairness-oriented cardiovascular interventions. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the role played by fairness in cardiovascular health, and to determine whether fairness is a common causal process linking such other risk factors as racism, low SES, and work stress to subsequent biological mediators of cardiovascular illness. The objective of this application is to experimentally elucidate relationships between specific measurements of fairness beliefs and multiple biological stress pathways. The central hypothesis of this application is that procedural and distributive fairness will independently and interdependently predict more adaptive biological stress reactivity. In addition, we expect that these relationships will be reflected in both trait dispositions and situational judgments of fairness, and also in multiple biological and disease relevant stress pathways. The specific aims are to 1) measure the unique and interactive contributions of distributive (favorable outcomes) and procedural (treatment by others) fairness on biological stress reactivity; 2) measure the unique and interactive contributions of dispositional (trait) and situationally induced (state) fairness on biological stress reactivity; 3) measure relationships between fairness beliefs and important biological stress pathways, including markers of hemodynamic reactivity, HPA axis arousal, and pro-inflammatory processes. The proposed research will administer a modified version of a well established and laboratory-based stress induction paradigm. In doing so, this research will experimentally evaluate associations between specific kinds of fairness beliefs and multiple biological stress pathways. The public health implication of the project is significant. Namely, the proposed research will provide an important step towards defining disease relevant models, and for targeting and evaluating psychosocial interventions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Beliefs about fairness predict both stress reactivity and incidence of cardiovascular illness. The proposed research will use experimental methodologies to assess independent and interdependent effects of multiple kinds of fairness beliefs on biological stress processes.

"Health Disparities and Stress Hypothesis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application argues that progress in understanding the origins of racial and socioeconomic position (SEP) disparities has been impeded by several problems, the two most important of which are the problem of misclassification and the failure to adequately assess differences in stress exposure. In our view, information on the origins of health disparities can most effectively be pursued by an approach that avoids the typical classification error of counting disordered individuals as non-disordered because they do not exhibit the particular disease or disorder under investigation or have a nascent disorder that has not progressed enough to be clinically detectable. We suggest that such misclassification is likely to have obscured potentially modifiable factors that are centrally implicated in the documented elevation in health risk among African Americans and persons of low SEP, and argue that it can be avoided by a joining of biomarker methodologies for estimating physical health status and reliable estimates of the presence of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems within a community-based population study. There is also evidence indicating that the failure of prior research to take account of a range of social stressors has significantly biased estimates of racial and SEP differences in exposure to stress and resulted in the systematic underestimation of the contributions of stress exposure to the occurrence of racial and SEP disparities in health. Among the unique aspects of the proposed research are: 1) the substantial avoidance of epidemiologic misclassification through the simultaneous consideration of one or more operationalizations of allostatic load and the assessment of cell aging, in combination with both clinical and subclinical assessments of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems; 2) estimation of stress exposure in terms of lifetime exposure to major and potential traumatic events, recent life events, chronic stressors, discrimination stress, and, among African Americans, stress arising from colorism and from uncertainty and/or ambiguity associated with covert discrimination; and 3) in the context provided by 1 and 2 above, to assess an exceptionally comprehensive array of hypothesized risk/protective factors including, through a subsequent grant application, gene-environment interactions. We will study a representative community-based sample of 1600 adults, ages 25 to 65 selected such that half are African American, half are female, and sufficient numbers of middle and upper SEP African Americans who do and do not live in segregated areas are included to allow at least substantial disentanglement of the effects of race, SEP, and segregation. The research proposed is aimed toward the identification of potentially modifiable social, contextual, and personal factors that contribute to racial and SEP health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The study addresses the social determinants of racial and socioeconomic position disparities in health.

"Integrative Stress Reduction for Maternal-Child Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to promote the candidate's development as an independent clinical trial researcher in mind-body medicine with a focus on reducing disparities in maternal-child health. Rates of preterm birth and low birth weight are increasing and are persistently higher among vulnerable U.S. populations. Animal and human models consistently implicate maternal stress as a significant risk factor in the etiology of adverse birth outcomes. Maladaptive patterns in hormonal and cardiovascular aspects of the stress response appear to be linked with preterm birth and low birth weight. In addition, psychological stress and poor coping may drive physiological stress responses that lead to adverse birth outcomes. Dr. Duncan's research, using the framework of revised Stress and Coping Theory (Folkman, 1997), has shown that pregnant women who learn mind-body practices during pregnancy report healthy improvements in levels of perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety, mindfulness, positive and negative affect, and depression in the perinatal period. The candidate seeks additional training in the design and conduct of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of mind-body interventions and understanding of physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying the stress response during pregnancy. The    University of California, San Francisco is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides access to experts in RCT methodology, integrative medicine, and the basic sciences of psychological and physiological aspects of the stress response, including the physiology of human pregnancy. The training plan includes formal coursework, informal tutorials with experts in their respective fields, and supervision of Dr. Duncan's leadership as PI on an RCT assessing the efficacy of a mind-body enhanced version of an existing, culturally-sensitive, group-based model of prenatal healthcare delivery. Rigorous testing of hypotheses regarding the impact of the mind-body practices will occur by comparing the effects of the mindbody enhanced program with the standard program. Effects of each intervention on psychological stress and coping mechanisms, stress physiology (neuroendocrine and cardiovascular/ autonomic nervous system function), and birth outcomes (gestational age and birth weight) will be compared. The results of the study will provide initial information about whether a mind-body intervention targeted to reduce stress during the perinatal period through mindfulness may provide clinical benefit for improving birth outcomes, thus informing development of an R01 proposal and advancing the long term goal of reducing health disparities.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Maternal stress is consistently linked with preterm birth and low birth weight. The integrative stress reduction intervention being tested targets psychological stress and coping, stress hormones, and cardiovascular stress reactivity through mindfulness practices. If the enhanced intervention is effective, it will help to address a key public health problem and may help reduce health disparities in maternal-child health.          ",Integrative Stress

"Stress and Health Among Sexual Minority Immigrants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in mental health and health services utilization are crucial public health and social justice concerns. Prior research has established differences in mental and physical health between different subsets of the US population, including differences between ethnic groups and between people who differ in sexual orientation. These disparities may be linked to experiences of prejudice, discrimination, and stigmatization that are common in the lives of both racial/ethnic minorities and lesbian, gay, and bisexual people (i.e., sexual minorities) and that may be even greater among individuals who are also immigrants to the US. The proposed two-study, two-year research project is guided by a conceptual model of minority stress that identifies potential causes, moderators, and mediators, some that derive from interactions with the ""dominant"" culture and some from associations with similarly stigmatized individuals, that impact the mental health of sexual minority immigrants. Specifically, in Study 1 a large and representative public health dataset of California residents will be used to test predictions about disparities in mental health and health services utilization as a function of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, immigrant status, and combinations of these characteristics. In addition, a complementary research approach, interviews, will be utilized in Study 2 to learn about sources of and experiences with minority stress directly from sexual minority immigrants (specifically Asian and Latino), as well as about their coping resources and activities. For Study 1, and based on minority stress frameworks, poorer health and less utilization are expected for stigmatized individuals, but especially among individuals who possess multiple stigmatizing characteristics. Analyses of the Study 2 first-person accounts will focus on identifying themes across and between participants in order to explicate minority stress theoretical constructs, write items of future research, and to provide context for understanding the Study 1 findings. Thus, the specific aims of this project include assessing health disparities 1) as a function of gender and ethnic, sexual minority, and immigrant statuses separately, and 2) as a function of combined multiple minority characteristics. 3) In addition, subjective experiences related to the possible moderators and mechanisms identified in the proposed conceptual model linking stigmatizing characteristics to poorer health among sexual minority immigrants will be explored. The project is original and timely in focusing on a hidden group of individuals who face unique health risks. It also has the potential to advance scientific knowledge of health disparities, minority stress, and health and well-being, and the results could potentially be used to inform policies, practices, and community programming focused on meeting the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable populations.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Health disparities may be linked to experiences of prejudice, discrimination, and stigmatization that are common in the lives of both racial/ethnic minorities and lesbian, gay, and bisexual people and that may be even greater among immigrants. The proposed research uses complementary quantitative and qualitative research approaches in focusing on health disparities and differences in mental health and health services utilization as a function of gender, ethnicity, immigrant status, sexual orientation, and combinations of these potentially stigmatizing characteristics.

"Stress, Lead, Iron Deficiency and Neurodevelopment Social stressors, iron deficiency anemia, and lead exposure are all environmental risk factors for poor neurodevelopment in young children. All three factors are highly prevalent in poor communities, whether in Mexico or the U.S. There are scant human epidemiologic studies on chronic social stress and human neurodevelopment. In addition, previous studies of child development and neurotoxicants have typically analyzed covariate markers of social stress as independent predictors of neurodevelopment; and thus, only considered social factors as potential confounders in their data analysis. There are biological reasons to believe that stress potentiates the toxicity of iron deficiency anemia and lead poisoning. If so, then understanding this relationship may be the key to designing effective public health interventions designed to improve neurodevelopment and may explain the lack of effectiveness of prevention/treatment regimens for lead poisoning and iron deficiency. A prospective cohort study with a large sample size is needed to address the potential multiplicative effects of combined stress/iron deficiency anemia and combined stress/lead exposure in predicting infant development.  This resubmission includes new data from a pilot study of stress-lead/stress-anemia interactions in 120 mother infant pairs conducted since the prior application, which demonstrates study feasibility and evidence for the hypothesized interactions. In this proposal we will measure maternal stress levels, infant iron deficiency anemia and lead exposure in a cohort of mother-infant pairs living in Mexico City and longitudinally measure maternal stress, iron stores, lead exposure, salivary cortisol and neurodevelopment beginning pre-natally and extending 3 years post-partum. This project will determine the independent effect of pre- and post-partum maternal stress in predicting infant development, and the multiplicative joint effects of maternal stress/iron deficiency and maternal stress/lead poisoning in predicting infant development.

"A Mindfulness-based Intervention to Reduce Diabetes Risk in Prediabetic Afr-Ameri DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pre-diabetes, characterized by glucose levels that are above normal but below the diagnostic criteria for diabetes, is an increasingly common condition affecting approximately 54 million U.S. adults. African Americans are disproportionately affected by pre-diabetes and experience high rates of diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality including damage to the circulatory system, kidneys, and nervous system. Patients with pre-diabetes who increase their physical activity and improve their diets have reduced risk of developing diabetes. Psychological distress negatively influences the course of the disease by increasing deleterious health behaviors; preventing scheduling and maintenance of positive behavior change; and stimulating HPA- axis activation and dysregulation, which may have a direct impact on insulin resistance and glucose metabolism. African Americans may have increased exposure to stress and increased vulnerability to adverse stress-related health outcomes like diabetes, because of their unique history, socio-cultural experiences, and societal position in the U.S. Helping individuals to reduce stress and to increase healthy coping strategies may enhance conventional diabetes prevention efforts, especially among African Americans. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), a mind-body practice with a wide range of health benefits, has been shown to result in statistically significant reductions in psychological stress and anxiety in randomized, controlled studies. Mindfulness training is cost-effective in comparison with other small-group or individualized programs, and can be taught safely and effectively by well-trained instructors. There is little research, and no randomized, controlled trials of MBSR as a treatment for individuals with pre-diabetes. There is also little research on the acceptability of MBSR program to a pre-diabetic subgroup of African Americans, or on the acceptability of an MBSR program for a general population of African Americans. Overall goals of this exploratory pilot study are to study the potential efficacy of a diabetes prevention education program that includes training in mindfulness-based stress reduction for pre-diabetic African Americans. Specific Aims are 1) to determine the feasibility of developing a clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based diabetes prevention program (treatment group) with a conventional diabetes prevention program (control group) in improving glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic African American adults; 2) to identify relevant physiological and psychological secondary outcomes associated with a mindfulness-based, educational self-care program in African Americans with pre-diabetes; 3) to assess the acceptability and cultural relevance of MBSR for pre-diabetic African Americans via a post-intervention qualitative study, to include interviews of participants, dropouts, and instructors; and 4) to identify, and find solutions for, problems in conducting a well-powered clinical trial to assess the efficacy of a mindfulness-based diabetes prevention program in improving glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic African-Americans.     This project will investigate the acceptability, feasibility, and efficacy of a mind-body intervention, Mindfulness- Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), as an adjunct to health education in reducing impaired glucose metabolism in pre-diabetic African Americans. We predict that reduction of stress and improvement in coping resources through training in diabetes education enhanced by MBSR training will positively influence health behaviors and physiological responses to stress, and thus improve pre-diabetic state.",A Mindfulness-based Intervention to Reduce Diabetes Risk in Prediabetic Afr-Ameri,8114200,R21AT004276,"['Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' post intervention ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' insulin secretion ', ' Consumption ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Process Measure ', ' Nicotine ', ' Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- ', ' Health education ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Instruction ', ' instructor ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Schedule ', ' Physical activity ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Salivary ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Solutions ', ' Training ', ' Control Groups ', ' glucose metabolism ', ' Funding ', ' behavior change ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' coping ', ' glucose tolerance ', ' Subgroup ', ' Morbidity -

"Causes and Impact of Minority Stress on Health and Development in Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual orientation group disparities in several critical health domains are now well documented, with sexual minorities reporting more psychological distress, substance use and dependence, and eating disorders symptoms. Little is known about the reasons underlying higher risk behaviors among sexual minorities relative to heterosexuals. Herein, we propose to explain these sexual orientation disparities by testing our Sexual Minority Stress Theory (SMST). SMST is based on society's stigmatization of homosexuality. Gay-related stress, the experience by a sexual-minority individual of society's stigmatization, consists of external stressors (such as prejudice, discrimination, verbal abuse, physical violence) perpetrated by known individuals (such as kin, heterosexual friends) and strangers in the community. Gay-related stress also consists of internal stress, in which the sexual-minority individual internalizes society's stigmatization, such as possessing negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Our proposed research will address the impact of gay-related stress on disparities between and among sexual orientation subgroups in psychological distress, physiological distress (cortisol, DHEA), health behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood, and examine moderators, such as the effect of parent-child relationships on the relations between sexual orientation and gay-related stress and the effect of coping on the relations between gay-related stress and both psychological and physiological distress. Gay-related stress may be particularly important in influencing a sexual minority youth's development and psychosocial adjustment in emerging adulthood. Our research will be sensitive to important precursors of gay-related stress, such as gender nonconformity. It will also examine how sex, age at experiencing gay-related stress, sexual minority status and transitions in status, concordant vs. nonconcordant orientation patterns among sexual minorities, and sexual identity development vary with gay-related stress, health, adaptation, and adjustment outcomes. We will collect new self-report survey and biological data to investigate these critical issues in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal cohort study of 16,882 U.S. adolescents and emerging adults begun in 1996 and ongoing. Specifically, we will add 3 data collection phases to more than 10 years of data collected from GUTS and link the youths' data with those of their mothers, who comprise the Nurses' Health Study II. We will examine disparities in violence victimization in childhood and adolescence and other forms of gay-related stress and the impact of these over time on subsequent psychological and physiological distress, substance use and eating disordered behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disturbing evidence exists of disparities in tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use and dependence, eating disorder symptoms, and a number of other important health indicators adversely affecting sexual-minority youth relative to heterosexual peers. Our proposed research will address the critical need for new epidemiologic investigations into the impact of violence victimization, harassment, and other gay- related stressors on the health of this underserved and understudied population, providing valuable data to researchers and clinicians working to improve the health of all youth.           Public Health Relevance: Disturbing evidence exists of disparities in tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use and dependence, eating disorder symptoms, and a number of other important health indicators adversely affecting sexual-minority youth relative to heterosexual peers.

"Chronic stress in pregnancy: Self-report, biomarkers, and birth outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic stress, with adverse effects on the immune system and on inflammatory response, may be an important cause of preterm birth and associated racial disparities in birth outcomes. However, an association between maternal stress and preterm birth has been inconsistently reported in the literature. One reason may be the use of multiple and varied surveys, tools, and instruments to measure self-reported stress in pregnancy. Using item response theory (IRT) modeling, we propose to develop a single, comprehensive, validated scale to measure self- reported stress in pregnancy - or an ""optimized"" stress in pregnancy scale. The scale will be derived from the responses of 2,006 women to multiple self-reported stress surveys in the Pregnancy, Infection and Nutrition (PIN) Study database. Specifically, IRT characterizes each item according to its location on the concept's continuum (e.g., stress severity) and its ability to discriminate individuals along this continuum. Having this item-level data permits the identification of the best items for an optimized scale. We propose to evaluate the association between self-reported stress, measured by the optimized stress in pregnancy scale and CRH and cortisol levels and between self-reported and preterm birth in women in the PIN Study. An optimized scale of self-reported stress in pregnancy is essential for future studies to be able to examine causal relationships between self-reported stress, biologic markers of stress, and preterm birth. If chronic maternal stress can be shown to be predictive of preterm birth, an optimized stress in pregnancy scale could serve as a screening tool of high-risk pregnant women and as an evaluation tool of treatment strategies to mitigate stress during pregnancy and to reduce preterm delivery and disparities in preterm birth.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to create a more efficient and effective scale to measure self-reported stress in pregnancy by applying Item Response Theory modeling to the responses to multiple stress surveys already collected from 2,006 pregnant women in the Pregnancy, Infection and Nutrition (PIN) Study and, then, to investigate associations between self-reported stress, measured by the optimized stress scale, and stress biomarkers and preterm birth for women in the PIN Study.

"The Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma from Terror: A Developmental Perspec    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed work addresses a key goal of NIMH Program Announcement PA-07-312, which seeks to enhance scientific understanding about the etiology of psychopathology related to violence and trauma"". The almost 4000 missiles that fell within Northern Israel in the summer of 2006, the damage suffered by property and persons, and the confinement of many families in bomb shelters during the terror period created a unique 'naturalistic' laboratory for assessing the effects of PTSD caused by exposure to a circumscribed period of terror. Within this context, we will examine the health and behavior of fetuses and birth parameters of pregnant women who were residents of the North at the time of the war and test for gene and environmental moderation of fetal and birth measures. We will study two groups: (1) 150 women who are residents of cities attacked during the ""war"" and who meet full criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of their exposure to attacks, and (2) 150 women from the same cohort, who show no symptoms of PTSD. The study will be the first study to examine fetal health and behavior in pregnant women with PTSD and the first study to test for gene-based vulnerabilities and Gene x Environment on these measures. The study speaks to the impact of terror induced PTSD on fetal development, the potential transmission of biological events associated with PTSD from mother to fetus, and environmental and genetic factors that may exacerbate fetal risk. The specific aims of the study are: Aim 1. Fetal health and behavior will be adversely affected by maternal PTSD. Hypothesis 1 asserts that fetuses of mothers exposed to terror and suffer from PTSD will show signs of poorer health (stunted fetal growth measures, atypical reactivity and regulation of heart rate and torso/limb movement to challenge, and complications) and poorer birth/neonatal parameters (birth weight, head circumference, gestational age at delivery, and complications) than women who were exposed to terror, but who do not develop PTSD. We also predict an association between posttraumatic stress symptoms and outcome measures, across the sample. Aim 2. Psychosocial stresses and maternal depression predict fetal health, behavior, and stress reactivity and regulation. Hypothesis 2 posits that, among women with PTSD, psychosocial stressors (life events, chronic stressors) and maternal depression will add significant risk to their fetus. Hypothesis 3 predicts that, in the full sample, psychosocial stress and maternal depression will moderate the effects of maternal PTSD. Aim 3. Analyses of candidate gene associations with fetal/neonatal outcomes. We will evaluate the association between offspring's genotype (indexed by a battery of candidate genes) and fetal/neonatal outcomes. Hypothesis 4 predicts that variants of these genes will have main effects on infant outcomes. Hypothesis 5 predicts we will find gene-environment interactions as follows: a) risk variants implicated in hypothesis 4 will moderate the impact that mothers' PTSD and mother's psychosocial stress each have on fetal/neonatal outcomes (i.e., we expect to observe gene-environment interactions).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE PARAGRAPH: The violence outside the home, as experienced in some US communities (sporadic and frequent) can affect anyone near by. Information regarding the relation between exposure to violence and PTSD on fetal development and birth outcome is important for understanding the processes that can promote developmental risk in communities with such violence. In this regard, the distribution of adverse reproductive health outcomes in the US and other developed nations is characterized by large racial/ethic disparities (Anachebe 2003). In the US, an almost two-fold disparity persists in the rate of premature birth between African American and non-Hispanic White women, even after accounting for obstetric, socio demographic, and behavioral risk factors (Collins & Hammond 1996; MacDorman et al 2002); and it has been suggested that differences in risk may be related to variations in stress and stress physiology (Wadwa et al 2001). The results of the proposed study, which examines genetic and environmental risk in relation to fetal health, can further understanding of individual differences in psycho- neuroendocrine processes that underlie or contribute to the risk of pre maturity and adverse neurodevelopment, and both represent major public health issues in the US.          ",The Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma from Terror: A Developmental Perspec,8101835,R01HD053586,"['Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Israel ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Neonatal ', ' Head circumference ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' NIH Program Announcements ', ' Program Announcement ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Fetal development of the mammalian embryo or fetus ', ' Fetal Development ', ' stressor ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Health behavior ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Fetal Growth ', ' intrauterine growth ', ' Cities ', ' Discipline of obstetrics ', ' Obstetrics ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Nation ', ' Developed Country ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Affect ', ' Communities ', ' Exposure to ', ' Laboratories ', ' indexing ', ' War ', ' Symptoms ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress ', ' Reproductive Health ', ' cohort ', ' Chronic ', ' Time ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Accounting ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Ethics ', ' ethical ', ' Woman ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' offspring ', ' Mothers ', ' Risk ', ' Genes ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Sampling ', ' Event ', ' Family ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' public health relevance ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' base ', ' experience ', ' Genotype ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Life ', ' Trauma ', ' Biological ', ' Genetic ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Fetus ', ' Measures ', ' psychosocial ', ' Physiology ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' fetal ', ' Property ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Behavioral ', ' Address ', ' Goals ', ' Work ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Regulation ', ' meetings ', ' Persons ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Testing ', ' Process ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Shelter facility ', ' shelter-housing ', ' shelter ', ' infant outcome ', ' intergenerational ', ' maternal depression ', ' depressed mother ', ' limb movement ', ' ']",NICHD,UPSTATE MEDICAL UNIVERSITY,R01,2011,342136,0.06002645186025938
"Standardization of the Hispanic Stress Inventory 2 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II study will utilize a multi-trait/multi-method research design. Our research design will include data collection tasks in 4 research sites that represent the diversity of the national Hispanic adult population: Los Angeles, Miami, El Paso, and Boston. The total research sample will consist of 2,400 Hispanics, ages 18 and older. A cross sectional, quota based sampling design will be used in 3 distinct developmentally distinct target samples, including a) college aged adults, b) parents, and c) seniors over 60. A cross-sectional survey will be implemented in the 4 research sites. This research responds to the growth in the Hispanic population along with a large market of mental health clinicians, primary health care providers and researchers as well as educators, counselors and criminal justice professionals who are demanding culturally relevant assessment tools for the screening and early diagnosing of stress in the Hispanic population. Recent trends in health reform and emphasis on prevention of health and behavioral health problems will necessitate the use of better screening and diagnostic tools, particularly for minority groups who previously have had low access to such preventive services. High stress levels put Hispanic adults at-risk for a wide range of behavioral health problems. Our research will improve the technology of stress assessment in this vulnerable population in several ways. The Hispanic Stress Inventory (Version 2) will provide evidence that will convince the mental health and other health care professional customers that the product is scientifically proven and culturally relevant and an instrument they can depend on. Our research brings an important, and under researched perspective to the development of assessment technologies that will stimulate the development of similar screening inventories in other populations characterized by high immigration and high health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to reduce the mental health disparities gap in the Hispanic population through the use of accurate early detection and screening assessments has been well documented. Research on the development of Hispanic specific assessment tools has lagged far behind the general research in this area. Moreover, much of the development has been limited to translation of current existing objective assessments, inappropriate use of white non-Hispanic norm or reference groups, and lack of establishing validity for use with the Hispanic population. To the best of our knowledge, there currently are no readily available and accessible Hispanic-based assessment tools for use in screening, diagnosis or treatment planning efforts. To not take into account factors embedded within the Hispanic experience that mediate mental health (e.g., acculturation, language use, citizenship status), arguably, runs an end result risk of misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and premature termination (Cervantes & Acosta, 1992; Prieto, McNeil, Walls, & Gomez, 2001). This is remarkable given the sheer size of the Hispanic population and their need for behavioral health services. This Phase II study will utilize a multi-trait/multi-method research design. Our research design will include data collection tasks in 4 research sites that represent the diversity of the national Hispanic adult population: Los Angeles, Miami, El Paso, and Boston. The total research sample will consist of 2,400 Hispanics, ages 18 and older. A cross sectional, quota based sampling design will be used in 3 distinct developmentally distinct target samples, including a) college aged adults, b) parents, and c) seniors over 60. A cross-sectional survey will be implemented in the 4 research sites The intended impact of this study is very large with regard to reducing health disparities in the largest minority group in the United States. This research responds to the growth in the Hispanic population along with a large market of mental health clinicians, primary health care providers and researchers as well as educators, counselors and criminal justice professionals who are demanding culturally relevant assessment tools for the screening and early diagnosing of stress in the Hispanic population. Recent trends in health reform and emphasis on prevention of health and behavioral health problems will necessitate the use of better screening and diagnostic tools, particularly for minority groups who previously have had low access to such preventive services. High stress levels put Hispanic adults at-risk for a wide range of behavioral health problems. Our research will improve the technology of stress assessment in this vulnerable population in several ways: 7 The Hispanic Stress Inventory (Version 2) will provide evidence that will convince the mental health and other health care professional customers that the product is scientifically proven and culturally relevant and an instrument they can depend on. 7 Our research brings an important, and under researched perspective to the development of assessment technologies that will stimulate the development of similar screening inventories in other populations characterized by high immigration and high health disparities. While applications of acculturation theory to mental health problems in Hispanic populations suggest that there are significant relationships, there is little specific research on the development of valid and reliable assessment instruments that are sensitive to the multiple domains of acculturation stress. 7 Our proposed R&D has the added value of investigating the utility of a culturally relevant stress screening instrument by developing national norms. This is an important outcome for the professional customers of screening and early diagnosis products.

"Stress, Gene-Environment Interaction and Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Although psychosocial stress has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of cardiovascular disease, empirical verifications of the effects of stress and the biological mechanisms through which stress operates remain rare. A major limitation has been the absence of population studies with direct biologic measures of stress (such as measures of levels of stress hormones), so that their link to social antecedents and to biological precursors of cardiovascular disease can be studied. It has also become increasingly apparent that social conditions and stressors must interact with genetic makeup, and that some of these exposures may modify gene expression through changes in DNA methylation but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the gene-environment interactions and epigenetic changes related to psychosocial factors. A major goal of this project is to better understand the ways in which socially patterned stress interacts with genetics and biology to influence cardiovascular-related outcomes. Using data from the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a large, multiethnic population sample, we propose to investigate long-term associations of the stress response (as characterized by multiple measures of stress hormones) with social/psychosocial antecedents and cardiovascular-related outcomes, as well as modifications of the stress response by variations in selected candidate genes, and links between psychosocial factors and epigenetic changes. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of repeat measures of stress hormones with social and psychosocial factors and with biological precursors of cardiovascular disease including inflammation/hemostasis and measures of insulin resistance and adiposity; (2) To examine interactions between cortisol levels and polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor gene with respect to cardiovascular-related outcomes; (3) To examine the extent to which polymorphisms of biologically relevant genes modify the response to a psychological stress challenge; and (4) To examine epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) of the glucocorticoid receptor gene as well as genomic DNA methylation and their association with (a) lifecourse social exposures; (b) cortisol and hemodynamic responses to a stress challenge; and (c) biological parameters previously linked to stress exposures. Our study will enhance our understanding not only of the epidemiologic links between stress and cardiovascular disease but also of the biologic mechanisms (involving genetic polymorphisms and changes to gene expression) through which these effects may be mediated. By illustrating how the study of genetic variability, biological markers, and social conditions can be integrated to enhance our understanding of the causes of ill health our project has the potential for contributing to major paradigmatic change in health research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been argued that stress may be important to the development of cardiovascular disease, but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the way in which stress operates. This study will investigate the links between stress and biological factors important to cardiovascular disease, including the interactions between stress and genes. This approach is necessary to better understand the importance of stress and to develop preventative interventions.           Relevance It has been argued that stress may be important to the development of cardiovascular disease, but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the way in which stress operates.

"Stress Management Among Latinos with Type 2 Diabetes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of a stress reduction intervention among Latinos with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) served by Hartford Hospital on: a) HbA1c levels, and b) stress reactivity measured through a blood glucose sensor and an automated Interactive Voice Response System (IVR). To obtain 200 study completers, 250 Latinos with T2D will be recruited from the 'Amigos en Salud' clinic. They will be randomly assigned to either: a) the control group that will receive 3 community health worker (CHW) led nutrition educational group sessions, or b) the intervention group that in addition will receive an 8-session stress management intervention delivered by a trained CHW. Intervention will be delivered at the Hispanic Health Council in a group format (12 members per group). The primary outcome of the intervention will be HbA1c measured at baseline, post-intervention (9 weeks post-enrollment) and 6 months. The secondary outcome will be stress reactivity measured through an IVR system that involves inserting a metabolic sensor that participants will carry for 3 days as well as daily reporting, via an automated voice system, of stress related events and coping during the same period of time and 6 month s post-enrollment. A subsample (n=75) will participate in the IVR and metabolic sensor measurements conducted pre/post intervention. All study participants will be applied an e-tablet based survey in their homes to assess mental health, nutrition and basic socio-economic and demographic parameters. Blood samples will be collected by a community phlebotomist in the participants' homes at the same time points.

"Sex Differences in Stress Receptors Underlie Female Vulnerability to Stress    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress-related psychiatric disorders, like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are debilitating mental illnesses that affect twice as many women as men. Although the etiology of this disparity remains unknown, it is thought to be due to sex differences in stress responses. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) orchestrates stress responses, in part, by regulating norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transmission, and CRF is dysregulated in stress-related disorders. The goal of my current research is to identify sex differences in a receptor for CRF (CRF1 subtype) that may account for sex differences in stress responsivity. To date, I found that CRF1 signals and is trafficked differently in female rats in a manner that can account for elevated responses to acute stress and decreased adaptation to chronic stress. In females, CRF1 immunoprecipitation revealed a greater coupling to Gs, the GTP-binding protein that mediates most cellular responses. Additionally, stress-induced CRF1 association with 2-arrestin2, an integral step in receptor internalization, was apparent in males but not females. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed stress-induced CRF1 internalization in male rats only, suggesting that this adaptive process to compensate for large amounts of CRF, as may be released in depression, is compromised in females. Importantly, sex differences in CRF1 function rendered NE neurons in the locus coeruleus of female rats more sensitive to low levels of CRF and less adaptable to high levels of CRF. However, because this is the first report of sex differences in stress- related neuropeptide receptor, many questions remain unanswered. Aim 1 of this proposal, which will be completed during the mentored phase (K99), investigates why CRF1 binds proteins differently in males vs. females. There are no sex differences in CRF1 structure, so I will learn proteomic approaches to identify whether sex differences in post-translational modifications of CRF1 account for these effects. Aims 2 and 3 will be completed during the independent phase. Aim 2 will identify the hormones that contribute to the sex difference in CRF1. To this end, I will combine previously acquired endocrine techniques with the skills learned during the K99 phase to determine whether ovarian or testicular hormones establish the sex differences. Aim 3 will evaluate whether sex differences extend to the other receptor subtype, CRF2, in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Because CRF1 and CRF2 share a high degree of sequence identity, proteomic approaches are expected to reveal sex differences in the CRF2. CRF2 activation of the dorsal raphe-5-HT system promotes a passive behavioral response strategy to stress that is a risk factor for depression. Thus, sex differences in CRF2 may contribute to the increased vulnerability of females this disorder. By addressing these questions, this proposal will help elucidate the etiology of sex differences in stress-related disorders. Moreover, because CRF antagonists are being developed to treat these illnesses, considering sex differences in CRF receptors may increase the efficacy of these compounds in women.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, however the biological basis of this sex difference remains unknown. The proposed research will identify molecular and hormonal changes that increase the function of a critical stress-related neuropeptide in female rats. This project will not only help us understand why women are more vulnerable to stress-related mental illnesses, but it will identify new pharmaceutical targets which can lead to treatments that are efficacious in both men and women.              Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, however the biological basis of this sex difference remains unknown.

"Caregiver Stress: Interventions to Promote Health and Wellbeing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Program Project aims to promote health and reduce cardiovascular risk in family caregivers of persons with chronic illness. As family caregivers provide physical, psychosocial, and instrumental care to their loved ones with prolonged and progressive health conditions, they often experience tremendous burden while balancing other life demands. Chronic intense caregiving represents a situation of chronic stress, which takes a toll on health through a cascade of deleterious physiological stress processes. Along with caregivers' lack of attention to their own health promotion, risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular, is a major concern. Few studies have explored self-care interventions for family caregivers especially targeted to improve coping with the stressful circumstances and also to ameliorate the harmful effects of chronic stress ultimately associated with cardiovascular risk. In two studies, using a psychoneuroimmunological approach, we will test two interventions, psycho-education and physical exercise, individually and in combination. The first study will target family caregivers of African American dementia patients; the second will focus on family caregivers of heart failure patients. Parallel designs, interventions and measures will create synergy as will integration of all data management and analyses within a Biobehavioral Science and Measures Core. This Core will also provide high level guidance and interpretation of model testing resulting from analysis of the common data set. The combined data set will allow for elucidating the neuroendocrine mechanisms of stress-induced cardiovascular risk, further developing the model, and stimulating future research, while the shared core support will provide substantial efficiency; neither could be achieved outside of a Program Project approach. These collective efforts will generate important data whereby future care can significantly enhance the lives of family caregivers and minimize their risk of cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of disability and death in the United States. More and more family members are providing care to their loved ones with prolonged and progressive illnesses. Chronic intense caregiving represents a situation of chronic stress, which takes a toll on one's mental and physical health including an increased risk for the development or worsening of heart disease. Identification of effective self-care interventions for family caregivers is warranted to improve their emotional wellbeing and minimize the harmful effects of chronic stress on the heart.",Caregiver Stress: Interventions to Promote Health and Wellbeing,8142856,P01NR011587,"['Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' P01 Program ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' loved ones ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Test Result ', ' Emotional ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Data Collection ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' psychosocial ', ' Leadership ', ' Participant ', ' data management ', ' coping ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Family member ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Persons ', ' disability ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Chronic ', ' School Nursing ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Chronic stress ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' Nurses ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Manuals ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Risk ', ' Universities ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Science ', ' Outcome ', ' Data ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' experience ', ' Attention ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Future ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Health ', ' improved ', ' Modeling ', ' Clinical ', ' skills ', ' Research ', ' Testing ', ' Control Groups ', ' Patients ', ' Goals ', ' Talents ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Training ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' response ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Exercise ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Caring ', ' Heart ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' psychoeducational intervention ', ' Nursing Research ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P01,2011,666086,0.06969571218820786
"Air pollution, stress and urban child development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasingly, prospective epidemiological studies link maternal stress during pregnancy with adverse neurodevelopment in children. Recent evidence also suggests that perinatal ambient air pollution exposure may have neurotoxic effects. While historically research has focused on how social and physical environmental factors independently affect children's health, evolving research underscores the importance of studying interactive effects. Moreover, marginalized populations of lower-socioeconomic position (SEP) are exposed disproportionately to traffic- related pollutants while living in adverse social circumstances or communities that are ""socially"" toxic. Consequently, these populations experience both increased stress and increased chemical pollution. Social x chemical interactions may account for more variance in explaining risk than the main effects of either factor alone. Relevant studies in urban populations are rare and none assess stress and air pollution together. Studies of mechanistic pathways linking perinatal air pollution and/or stress to neurodevelopment are equally sparse. We take advantage of an established pregnancy cohort - the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS) project (R01 HL080674, RJ Wright PI), with prospectively characterized exposure to ambient pollutants starting in pregnancy coupled with extensive assessment of pre- and postnatal stress, as well as relevant confounders and mediators. We can draw from our biomarker archive including assessments of prenatal maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (e.g., cortisol), infant autonomic nervous system (ANS) and HPA axis function at age 6 months, and DNA banked for future genetic assays to explore mechanisms. In this application, we are proposing the addition of neurocognitive and behavioral testing in n=815 ACCESS children at age 6 years. We will then test the main effects of perinatal exposure to chronic ambient air pollution and/or psychological stress on these neuropsychiatric outcomes. We will next examine whether air pollution effects are modified by psychosocial stress. Mechanisms to be explored include perinatal stress (& air pollution)-elicited disruption in the maternal prenatal HPA axis and the child's HPA axis and ANS response. Finally, to further explore biological mechanisms by which air pollutants and stress impact neurodevelopment, genetic susceptibility factors will be examined.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the effects of perinatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution on childhood neurobehavioral and cognitive development in urban children. In addition to independent effects of air pollution, the study will also examine the potential modifying effects of the social environment (i.e., psychological stress) and genetic susceptibility on these relationships. Such knowledge may inform efforts to design programs that improve neurodevelopmental trajectories in high-risk urban populations disproportionately exposed to adverse physical and social environments.           Statement of Public Health Significance: This study will examine the effects of perinatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution on childhood neurobehavioral and cognitive development in urban children. In addition to independent effects of air pollution, the study will also examine the potential modifying effects of the social environment (i.e., psychological stress) and genetic susceptibility on these relationships.

"Causes and Impact of Minority Stress on Health and Development in Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual orientation group disparities in several critical health domains are now well documented, with sexual minorities reporting more psychological distress, substance use and dependence, and eating disorders symptoms. Little is known about the reasons underlying higher risk behaviors among sexual minorities relative to heterosexuals. Herein, we propose to explain these sexual orientation disparities by testing our Sexual Minority Stress Theory (SMST). SMST is based on society's stigmatization of homosexuality. Gay-related stress, the experience by a sexual-minority individual of society's stigmatization, consists of external stressors (such as prejudice, discrimination, verbal abuse, physical violence) perpetrated by known individuals (such as kin, heterosexual friends) and strangers in the community. Gay-related stress also consists of internal stress, in which the sexual-minority individual internalizes society's stigmatization, such as possessing negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Our proposed research will address the impact of gay-related stress on disparities between and among sexual orientation subgroups in psychological distress, physiological distress (cortisol, DHEA), health behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood, and examine moderators, such as the effect of parent-child relationships on the relations between sexual orientation and gay-related stress and the effect of coping on the relations between gay-related stress and both psychological and physiological distress. Gay-related stress may be particularly important in influencing a sexual minority youth's development and psychosocial adjustment in emerging adulthood. Our research will be sensitive to important precursors of gay-related stress, such as gender nonconformity. It will also examine how sex, age at experiencing gay-related stress, sexual minority status and transitions in status, concordant vs. nonconcordant orientation patterns among sexual minorities, and sexual identity development vary with gay-related stress, health, adaptation, and adjustment outcomes. We will collect new self-report survey and biological data to investigate these critical issues in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal cohort study of 16,882 U.S. adolescents and emerging adults begun in 1996 and ongoing. Specifically, we will add 3 data collection phases to more than 10 years of data collected from GUTS and link the youths' data with those of their mothers, who comprise the Nurses' Health Study II. We will examine disparities in violence victimization in childhood and adolescence and other forms of gay-related stress and the impact of these over time on subsequent psychological and physiological distress, substance use and eating disordered behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disturbing evidence exists of disparities in tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use and dependence, eating disorder symptoms, and a number of other important health indicators adversely affecting sexual-minority youth relative to heterosexual peers. Our proposed research will address the critical need for new epidemiologic investigations into the impact of violence victimization, harassment, and other gay- related stressors on the health of this underserved and understudied population, providing valuable data to researchers and clinicians working to improve the health of all youth.

"Chronic stress in pregnancy: Self-report, biomarkers, and birth outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic stress, with adverse effects on the immune system and on inflammatory response, may be an important cause of preterm birth and associated racial disparities in birth outcomes. However, an association between maternal stress and preterm birth has been inconsistently reported in the literature. One reason may be the use of multiple and varied surveys, tools, and instruments to measure self-reported stress in pregnancy. Using item response theory (IRT) modeling, we propose to develop a single, comprehensive, validated scale to measure self- reported stress in pregnancy - or an ""optimized"" stress in pregnancy scale. The scale will be derived from the responses of 2,006 women to multiple self-reported stress surveys in the Pregnancy, Infection and Nutrition (PIN) Study database. Specifically, IRT characterizes each item according to its location on the concept's continuum (e.g., stress severity) and its ability to discriminate individuals along this continuum. Having this item-level data permits the identification of the best items for an optimized scale. We propose to evaluate the association between self-reported stress, measured by the optimized stress in pregnancy scale and CRH and cortisol levels and between self-reported and preterm birth in women in the PIN Study. An optimized scale of self-reported stress in pregnancy is essential for future studies to be able to examine causal relationships between self-reported stress, biologic markers of stress, and preterm birth. If chronic maternal stress can be shown to be predictive of preterm birth, an optimized stress in pregnancy scale could serve as a screening tool of high-risk pregnant women and as an evaluation tool of treatment strategies to mitigate stress during pregnancy and to reduce preterm delivery and disparities in preterm birth.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to create a more efficient and effective scale to measure self-reported stress in pregnancy by applying Item Response Theory modeling to the responses to multiple stress surveys already collected from 2,006 pregnant women in the Pregnancy, Infection and Nutrition (PIN) Study and, then, to investigate associations between self-reported stress, measured by the optimized stress scale, and stress biomarkers and preterm birth for women in the PIN Study. If chronic maternal stress can be shown to be predictive of preterm birth, then an optimized stress in pregnancy scale could serve as a screening tool of high-risk pregnant women and as an evaluation tool of treatment strategies to mitigate stress during pregnancy and to reduce preterm delivery and disparities in preterm birth.

"Biobehavioral Mechanisms Linking Stress and Obesity in Low-Income Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Highly stressed and impoverished populations are more likely to be obese, and ultimately more likely to develop obesity-associated comorbidities. Preventing these adverse health outcomes relies on preventing the development of obesity early in the life span, since obesity, once established, tends to persist and prevention is more effective than treatment. Preventing obesity is highly urgent for low-income children, since obesity is common early on in this demographic and may contribute to substantial health disparities later in life. Current prevention programs have limited effectiveness, and novel targets for intervention are needed. The association between stress and eating behavior is one potential novel target. Our research program focuses on links between stress, eating behavior, and obesity in low-income children. Our preliminary findings suggest that, in early childhood, patterns of cortisol secretion reflecting chronic stress may promote eating in the absence of hunger, reduced satiety responsiveness, and tantrums over food; these eating behaviors, in turn, may lead to obesity. This early work has made clear, however, that the pathways linking stress to obesity via eating behavior are complex and multifactorial, and involve biologic and behavioral pathways. To date we have examined only a subset of eating behaviors that could mediate links between stress and obesity. Other mechanisms that may be affected by stress, such as high sensitivity to food as a reward or poor ability to delay gratification for food, have not been examined in this model. How such eating behaviors may cluster and develop over time, how different aspects of stress (i.e., chronic vs. immediate stressors) relate to these behaviors, and how genotypes may moderate such associations remains unknown. We propose to examine how these processes may be driven by stress, and ultimately lead to obesity in children. This application is submitted in response to RFA- HL-12-037: ""Mechanistic Pathways Linking Psychosocial Stress and Behavior"" with the goal of providing a deeper understanding of the psychological and bio-behavioral processes that connect psychosocial stress with eating behaviors and ultimately obesity. The aims are: Aim 1: To examine the cross-sectional relationship of psychosocial stress (chronic and immediate stress) with obesity-promoting eating behaviors (including satiety responsiveness, reinforcing value of food, and the ability to delay gratification for food) and body mass index (BMI) z-score at age 7 years among low-income children. Aim 2: To test genetic moderators of stress-eating behavior links in our cohort of low-income children. Aim 3: To examine longitudinal associations of chronic stress and reactivity to stress early in life (age 3 years) with changes in obesity-promoting eating behaviors between ages 3 and 7 years. Improved understanding of the development of associations of psychosocial stress during early life with specific, well-phenotyped eating behaviors and excessive weight gain beginning in childhood may hold promise for novel obesity prevention efforts among low-income children, a demographic group at high risk.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Psychosocial stress is linked with overeating and the development of obesity, but the mechanisms underlying these associations are not well-understood, particularly in children. Improved understanding of the development of associations of social-contextual and interpersonal stress with eating behavior and excessive weight gain beginning in childhood may hold promise for novel targets for obesity prevention.

"Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Black Americans carry a disproportionate burden of social risk factors for poor mental health, such as living in violent urban environments and experiencing economic deprivation and discrimination. Despite these risks, Black Americans have lower lifetime prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders than Whites. The reasons for Black Americans' resilience to these mental health disorders are unknown. This proposal aims to examine cumulative adversity and subsequent diminished neurobiological stress response as a possible explanation of Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and depression. It also aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this resilience. These aims will be accomplished by conducting research interviews with 1,306 young adults (age 20-21; 60% Black, 40% White; 50% female) from an existing community sample who have been previously assessed three times during childhood and adolescence. These research interviews will provide information on adversity experienced by the participants, categorical diagnoses and dimensional measures of internalizing distress, and physiological indicators of reactivity to stress. Neural bases of stress response will be evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for a subset of 120 Black and 120 White participants from the larger study. This study is innovative because it proposes to test a novel mechanism explaining the resilience of Black Americans to depression and anxiety, incorporates both categorical and dimensional measures of internalizing problems, and examines the role of physiological stress response and regulatory neural circuit in the resilience process. The results will have important implications for our understanding of racial disparities i anxiety and depression, neurobiological mechanisms underlying resilience to stress, and relationships between environmental stress, neural and physiological response, and negative affect. These findings will point to novel ways to diagnose and treat mental health problems in Black and White Americans.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black Americans are exposed to more adversity than White Americans, yet they experience lower rates of anxiety and depressive disorders. The proposed project investigates cumulative adversity and diminished neurobiological stress response as causal mechanisms underlying Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and mood disorders.

"Air pollution, stress and urban child development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasingly, prospective epidemiological studies link maternal stress during pregnancy with adverse neurodevelopment in children. Recent evidence also suggests that perinatal ambient air pollution exposure may have neurotoxic effects. While historically research has focused on how social and physical environmental factors independently affect children's health, evolving research underscores the importance of studying interactive effects. Moreover, marginalized populations of lower-socioeconomic position (SEP) are exposed disproportionately to traffic- related pollutants while living in adverse social circumstances or communities that are ""socially"" toxic. Consequently, these populations experience both increased stress and increased chemical pollution. Social x chemical interactions may account for more variance in explaining risk than the main effects of either factor alone. Relevant studies in urban populations are rare and none assess stress and air pollution together. Studies of mechanistic pathways linking perinatal air pollution and/or stress to neurodevelopment are equally sparse. We take advantage of an established pregnancy cohort - the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS) project (R01 HL080674, RJ Wright PI), with prospectively characterized exposure to ambient pollutants starting in pregnancy coupled with extensive assessment of pre- and postnatal stress, as well as relevant confounders and mediators. We can draw from our biomarker archive including assessments of prenatal maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (e.g., cortisol), infant autonomic nervous system (ANS) and HPA axis function at age 6 months, and DNA banked for future genetic assays to explore mechanisms. In this application, we are proposing the addition of neurocognitive and behavioral testing in n=815 ACCESS children at age 6 years. We will then test the main effects of perinatal exposure to chronic ambient air pollution and/or psychological stress on these neuropsychiatric outcomes. We will next examine whether air pollution effects are modified by psychosocial stress. Mechanisms to be explored include perinatal stress (& air pollution)-elicited disruption in the maternal prenatal HPA axis and the child's HPA axis and ANS response. Finally, to further explore biological mechanisms by which air pollutants and stress impact neurodevelopment, genetic susceptibility factors will be examined.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the effects of perinatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution on childhood neurobehavioral and cognitive development in urban children. In addition to independent effects of air pollution, the study will also examine the potential modifying effects of the social environment (i.e., psychological stress) and genetic susceptibility on these relationships. Such knowledge may inform efforts to design programs that improve neurodevelopmental trajectories in high-risk urban populations disproportionately exposed to adverse physical and social environments.           Statement of Public Health Significance: This study will examine the effects of perinatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution on childhood neurobehavioral and cognitive development in urban children. In addition to independent effects of air pollution, the study will also examine the potential modifying effects of the social environment (i.e., psychological stress) and genetic susceptibility on these relationships.

"Sex Differences in Stress Receptors Underlie Female Vulnerability to Stress    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress-related psychiatric disorders, like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are debilitating mental illnesses that affect twice as many women as men. Although the etiology of this disparity remains unknown, it is thought to be due to sex differences in stress responses. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) orchestrates stress responses, in part, by regulating norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transmission, and CRF is dysregulated in stress-related disorders. The goal of my current research is to identify sex differences in a receptor for CRF (CRF1 subtype) that may account for sex differences in stress responsivity. To date, I found that CRF1 signals and is trafficked differently in female rats in a manner that can account for elevated responses to acute stress and decreased adaptation to chronic stress. In females, CRF1 immunoprecipitation revealed a greater coupling to Gs, the GTP-binding protein that mediates most cellular responses. Additionally, stress-induced CRF1 association with 2-arrestin2, an integral step in receptor internalization, was apparent in males but not females. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed stress-induced CRF1 internalization in male rats only, suggesting that this adaptive process to compensate for large amounts of CRF, as may be released in depression, is compromised in females. Importantly, sex differences in CRF1 function rendered NE neurons in the locus coeruleus of female rats more sensitive to low levels of CRF and less adaptable to high levels of CRF. However, because this is the first report of sex differences in stress- related neuropeptide receptor, many questions remain unanswered. Aim 1 of this proposal, which will be completed during the mentored phase (K99), investigates why CRF1 binds proteins differently in males vs. females. There are no sex differences in CRF1 structure, so I will learn proteomic approaches to identify whether sex differences in post-translational modifications of CRF1 account for these effects. Aims 2 and 3 will be completed during the independent phase. Aim 2 will identify the hormones that contribute to the sex difference in CRF1. To this end, I will combine previously acquired endocrine techniques with the skills learned during the K99 phase to determine whether ovarian or testicular hormones establish the sex differences. Aim 3 will evaluate whether sex differences extend to the other receptor subtype, CRF2, in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Because CRF1 and CRF2 share a high degree of sequence identity, proteomic approaches are expected to reveal sex differences in the CRF2. CRF2 activation of the dorsal raphe-5-HT system promotes a passive behavioral response strategy to stress that is a risk factor for depression. Thus, sex differences in CRF2 may contribute to the increased vulnerability of females this disorder. By addressing these questions, this proposal will help elucidate the etiology of sex differences in stress-related disorders. Moreover, because CRF antagonists are being developed to treat these illnesses, considering sex differences in CRF receptors may increase the efficacy of these compounds in women.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, however the biological basis of this sex difference remains unknown. The proposed research will identify molecular and hormonal changes that increase the function of a critical stress-related neuropeptide in female rats. This project will not only help us understand why women are more vulnerable to stress-related mental illnesses, but it will identify new pharmaceutical targets which can lead to treatments that are efficacious in both men and women.

"Standardization of the Hispanic Stress Inventory 2 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Phase II study will utilize a multi-trait/multi-method research design. Our research design will include data collection tasks in 4 research sites that represent the diversity of the national Hispanic adult population: Los Angeles, Miami, El Paso, and Boston. The total research sample will consist of 2,400 Hispanics, ages 18 and older. A cross sectional, quota based sampling design will be used in 3 distinct developmentally distinct target samples, including a) college aged adults, b) parents, and c) seniors over 60. A cross-sectional survey will be implemented in the 4 research sites. This research responds to the growth in the Hispanic population along with a large market of mental health clinicians, primary health care providers and researchers as well as educators, counselors and criminal justice professionals who are demanding culturally relevant assessment tools for the screening and early diagnosing of stress in the Hispanic population. Recent trends in health reform and emphasis on prevention of health and behavioral health problems will necessitate the use of better screening and diagnostic tools, particularly for minority groups who previously have had low access to such preventive services. High stress levels put Hispanic adults at-risk for a wide range of behavioral health problems. Our research will improve the technology of stress assessment in this vulnerable population in several ways. The Hispanic Stress Inventory (Version 2) will provide evidence that will convince the mental health and other health care professional customers that the product is scientifically proven and culturally relevant and an instrument they can depend on. Our research brings an important, and under researched perspective to the development of assessment technologies that will stimulate the development of similar screening inventories in other populations characterized by high immigration and high health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The need to reduce the mental health disparities gap in the Hispanic population through the use of accurate early detection and screening assessments has been well documented. Research on the development of Hispanic specific assessment tools has lagged far behind the general research in this area. Moreover, much of the development has been limited to translation of current existing objective assessments, inappropriate use of white non-Hispanic norm or reference groups, and lack of establishing validity for use with the Hispanic population. To the best of our knowledge, there currently are no readily available and accessible Hispanic-based assessment tools for use in screening, diagnosis or treatment planning efforts. To not take into account factors embedded within the Hispanic experience that mediate mental health (e.g., acculturation, language use, citizenship status), arguably, runs an end result risk of misdiagnosis, inappropriate treatment, and premature termination (Cervantes & Acosta, 1992; Prieto, McNeil, Walls, & Gomez, 2001). This is remarkable given the sheer size of the Hispanic population and their need for behavioral health services. This Phase II study will utilize a multi-trait/multi-method research design. Our research design will include data collection tasks in 4 research sites that represent the diversity of the national Hispanic adult population: Los Angeles, Miami, El Paso, and Boston. The total research sample will consist of 2,400 Hispanics, ages 18 and older. A cross sectional, quota based sampling design will be used in 3 distinct developmentally distinct target samples, including a) college aged adults, b) parents, and c) seniors over 60. A cross-sectional survey will be implemented in the 4 research sites The intended impact of this study is very large with regard to reducing health disparities in the largest minority group in the United States. This research responds to the growth in the Hispanic population along with a large market of mental health clinicians, primary health care providers and researchers as well as educators, counselors and criminal justice professionals who are demanding culturally relevant assessment tools for the screening and early diagnosing of stress in the Hispanic population. Recent trends in health reform and emphasis on prevention of health and behavioral health problems will necessitate the use of better screening and diagnostic tools, particularly for minority groups who previously have had low access to such preventive services. High stress levels put Hispanic adults at-risk for a wide range of behavioral health problems. Our research will improve the technology of stress assessment in this vulnerable population in several ways: 7 The Hispanic Stress Inventory (Version 2) will provide evidence that will convince the mental health and other health care professional customers that the product is scientifically proven and culturally relevant and an instrument they can depend on. 7 Our research brings an important, and under researched perspective to the development of assessment technologies that will stimulate the development of similar screening inventories in other populations characterized by high immigration and high health disparities. While applications of acculturation theory to mental health problems in Hispanic populations suggest that there are significant relationships, there is little specific research on the development of valid and reliable assessment instruments that are sensitive to the multiple domains of acculturation stress. 7 Our proposed R&D has the added value of investigating the utility of a culturally relevant stress screening instrument by developing national norms. This is an important outcome for the professional customers of screening and early diagnosis products.

"Role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and social stress on perinatal outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)      The goal of this K99/R00 Career Development Plan is to launch an independent research program in reproductive and environmental epidemiology of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which includes evaluating social determinants of health that may affect overlapping biologic pathways. To accomplish this goal, the candidate will enhance her expertise in environmental health sciences with didactic and hands-on training in reproductive biology, social epidemiology/stress science, and environmental epidemiologic methods. This specialized training will allow her to achieve her long term goal of becoming an independent academic investigator and offering new insights on the cumulative impacts of environmental and social factors on reproductive health.        The primary goal of the candidate's Research Plan is to evaluate the independent effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and psychosocial stress on thyroid hormone disruption and consequent perinatal outcomes among a population of socioeconomically and racially diverse pregnant women. This work is particularly innovative as both PBDEs and psychosocial stress can impact the thyroid system, suggesting a biologic plausibility for interaction; however the two exposures have never been examined simultaneously in a human study.  During the K99 mentored phase, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tracey Woodruff, the candidate will use innovative measures to characterize biologically-relevant exposures to PBDEs and psychosocial stress and their effects on thyroid hormone disruption. Exposure to PBDEs will be assessed using both PBDE congeners as well as their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PBDEs). Psychosocial stress will be evaluated with subjective measures of stress and telomere length, a biomarker of cellular aging that is influenced by psychosocial stress.  In the independent phase, the candidate will apply this knowledge to investigate the independent effects of PBDEs and psychosocial stress on adverse perinatal outcomes, such as gestational hypertension, preterm birth, and low birth weight, and assess whether these effects are mediated via the thyroid system. The integration of this work will enable the candidate to develop the necessary methodological and biological frameworks to examine the combined, and potentially synergistic, effects of environmental and psychosocial factors on perinatal outcomes in future R01 studies.  The candidate is well positioned to accomplish these goals at the University of California, San Francisco, a highly respected research institution, with a strong environmental reproductive health program, a world-renowned faculty with expertise in psychosocial stress, and an extensive biomedical infrastructure.  The primary mentor and co-mentors in reproductive sciences, environmental epidemiology, health disparities, stress science, and biostatistics will guide the process whereby the candidate learn the methods that are required to accomplish the goals set forth in this proposal. This project represents the cutting-edge of health disparities and environmental health research and seeks to answer critical scientific as well as policy-relevant questions for improving the health of vulnerable populations who often face disproportionate and elevated exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors.        Public Health Relevance: The goal of this project is to prepare Dr. Ami Zota to transition to a position as an independent academic investigator in environmental health sciences focusing on the consequence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy and social factors that may affect overlapping biologic pathways.  She will conduct epidemiologic analyses to investigate the effects of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants and psychosocial stress on perinatal outcomes and assess whether these effects are mediated by the thyroid system.  Results from this work will improve pregnancy outcomes and inform public health policy, particularly for vulnerable subpopulations, who often encounter elevated exposures to chemical and non-chemical stressors.

"Stress Management Among Latinos with Type 2 Diabetes  Abstract The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of a stress reduction intervention among Latinos with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) served by Hartford Hospital on: a) HbA1c levels, and b) stress reactivity measured through a blood glucose sensor and an automated Interactive Voice Response System (IVR). To obtain 200 study completers, 250 Latinos with T2D will be recruited from the 'Amigos en Salud' clinic. They will be randomly assigned to either: a) the control group that will receive 3 community health worker (CHW)led nutrition educational group sessions, or b) the intervention group that in addition will receive an 8-session stress management intervention delivered by a trained CHW. Intervention will be delivered at the Hispanic Health Council in a group format (12 members per group). The primary outcome of the intervention will be HbA1c measured at baseline, post-intervention (9 weeks post-enrollment) and 6 months. The secondary outcome will be stress reactivity measured through an IVR system that involves inserting a metabolic sensor that participants will carry for 3 days as well as daily reporting, via an automated voice system, of stress related events and coping during the same period of time and 6 month s post-enrollment. A subsample (n=75) will participate in the IVR and metabolic sensor measurements conducted pre/post intervention. All study participants will be applied an e-tablet based survey in their homes to assess mental health, nutrition and basic socio-economic and demographic parameters. Blood samples will be collected by a community phlebotomist in the participants' homes at the same time points. Knowledge gained from this randomized trial could lead to a highly innovative CHW led approach to improving the quality of life among individuals with T2D living in very stressful socio-economic environments.  Narrative There are no published studies examining the impact of stress management on metabolic control among Latinos with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

"Perinatal Programming of Infant Stress Reactivity and the Atopic Phenotype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biological hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli is a fundamental feature of atopy, predisposing individuals to a spectrum of disorders, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic asthma. Evidence linking psychological stress to atopy expression has grown with our increased understanding of the natural history and pathophysiology of atopic disorders and the neurobiology of stress. However, the specific pathways involved remain to be elucidated in human studies. Findings suggest that stressors may influence pathogenesis by causing dysregulated biobehavioral states (e.g., depression, PTSD), which exert effects on physiological processes that influence disease risk. Extreme forms of stress exposure (multiple stressors within the same time period, chronic stressors over developmental periods, traumatic events) are more likely to lead to persistent psychological and physiological alterations. Disturbed regulation of endocrine and autonomic systems (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system) may modulate offspring immune functioning beginning in utero. Therefore, understanding maternal dysregulation of these systems in pregnancy may be particularly informative. Non-optimal early caregiving experiences (e.g., maternal psychopathology, maternal insensitivity) may also impact these processes by leading to disrupted infant emotion regulation and neuroimmune development, setting the stage for altered reactivity to stimuli and inflammatory processes, hallmarks of early atopy. Exploring these links may be particularly relevant in urban populations, who are disproportionately burdened by both stress and chronic atopic disorders. We will examine the effects of maternal stress (cumulative perinatal stress, lifetime trauma), on the expression of child atopy in an urban sample (N=275). We will incorporate strategies for studying stress reactivity during pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood to elucidate pathways from stress to a hierarchy of early intermediate phenotypes that may be related to persistent atopic disorders (early sensitization as indexed by IgE expression and skin test reactivity, T-helper cell differentiation, airway resistance, early clinical phenotypes). We will examine how intervening processes may affect these relationships, including how maternal-fetal endocrine indicators of stress (prenatal cortisol, corticotrophin-releasing hormone), pre/postnatal maternal psychological functioning, and postnatal caregiving behaviors impact the infant stress response (cortisol, respiration, sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic functioning), assessed during a standardized laboratory protocol at age 6 months, and child atopic profiles assessed through 30 months. In this prospective design, we will examine how fetal stress exposure may influence early neuroimmune development and how such effects are independent of or moderated by postnatal factors. We will test the contributions of proximal and lifetime stress exposures on the proposed pathways. The study findings may identify mechanisms that lead to and maintain early predisposition to costly pediatric atopic disorders, informing more efficacious prevention and intervention strategies.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study may increase our understanding of the effects of perinatal maternal stress on vulnerability to early intermediate phenotypes that may predispose to subsequent risk for developing atopic disorders in childhood. Such knowledge may inform efforts to design programs to prevent the development of atopic disorders, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema, particularly in high-risk urban populations. Given the enormous cost in the management of atopic patients in the United States, understanding the earliest stages of development offers significant potential benefits to society.           Statement of Public Health Significance: This study may increase our understanding of the effects of perinatal maternal stress on vulnerability to early intermediate phenotypes that may predispose to subsequent risk for developing atopic disorders in childhood.

"Telomere Length as a Biological Marker of Allostatic Load in Children    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this research is to evaluate the validity of telomere length as a biomarker of physiological dysregulation or allostatic load (AL) [cumulative wear and tear on physiological systems and organs due  to adversity] in children. An assortment of biomarkers currently exists to measure components of AL across a variety of different physiological systems. Each of these measures has limitations in collection and interpretation, especially in children where the biologic effects of AL may not yet be detectable.  Consequently, very few studies have focused on biological risk of AL in children. Furthermore, many traditional AL biomarkers may not be appropriate for younger age groups given their developmental stage. Thus, validating the use of a  biomarker of AL that is objective; distinct from disease or risk state; and can be collected longitudinally and noninvasively would represent a significant and innovative contribution to research on AL and health disparities. Telomere length is a known marker of the cellular aging process and a potential biomarker of AL that is truly cumulative, given increasing evidence linking psychosocial stress and shortened telomere length. The proposed research will take advantage of a unique opportunity to validate telomere length as a biomarker of AL among children using DNA samples already obtained from a community-based sample of 260 African American children ages 4 to 14 years from inner-city New Orleans, LA, U.S. neighborhoods whose cumulative risk and/or stress exposure can be characterized at the individual, household, school and neighborhood levels. This proposal will establish a longitudinal cohort that will allow tracking of telomere length and other AL biomarkers in relation to cumulative risk exposure derived from multiple levels (i.e., individual, household, school, and   neighborhood). To accomplish our broad goal, we propose to address the following specific aims: 1) to  establish an sex and age matched cohort of 260 children from 87 census tracts for which saliva and  traditional AL markers as well as psychosocial and environmental measures of stress characterized at  multiple levels (i.e. individual, household, and neighborhood) will be collected in the first year and  combined with baseline data to include repeated samples of telomere length, for the first time, across a  varied age range of children; 2) to evaluate the validity of telomere length as a biomarker of AL. The   longitudinal design will also permit exploration of whether earlier versus concurrent stress exposure and   whether distal versus more proximal stress exposure are associated with telomere length changes.  Results will offer methods through which we can begin to better understand, develop, and expand   translational strategies to address and monitor biological risk and its impact on health outcomes, and at   an early point in the life course.        Public Health Relevance: This proposal will track and validate physiologic biomarkers in relation to stress exposure derived from multiple levels (i.e., individual, household, school, and neighborhood) among African American children. Validating the use of a biomarker that is objective; distinct from disease or risk state; and can be collected longitudinally and noninvasively would represent a significant and innovative contribution to research on stress related studies and health disparities, allowing us to better understand, develop, and expand translational strategies to address and monitor biological risk and its impact on health outcomes, and at an early point in the life course.

"Sex Differences in Stress Receptors Underlie Female Vulnerability to Stress   Stress-related psychiatric disorders, like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are debilitating mental illnesses that affect twice as many women as men. Although the etiology of this disparity remains unknown, it is thought to be due to sex differences in stress responses. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) orchestrates stress responses, in part, by regulating norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transmission, and CRF is dysregulated in stress-related disorders. The goal of my current research is to identify sex differences in a receptor for CRF (CRF1 subtype) that may account for sex differences in stress responsivity. To date, I found that CRF1 signals and is trafficked differently in female rats in a manner that can account for elevated responses to acute stress and decreased adaptation to chronic stress. In females, CRF1 immunoprecipitation revealed a greater coupling to Gs, the GTP-binding protein that mediates most cellular responses. Additionally, stress-induced CRF1 association with ¿-arrestin2, an integral step in receptor internalization, was apparent in males but not females. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed stress-induced CRF1 internalization in male rats only, suggesting that this adaptive process to compensate for large amounts of CRF, as may be released in depression, is compromised in females. Importantly, sex differences in CRF1 function rendered NE neurons in the locus coeruleus of female rats more sensitive to low levels of CRF and less adaptable to high levels of CRF. However, because this is the first report of sex differences in stress- related neuropeptide receptor, many questions remain unanswered. Aim 1 of this proposal, which will be completed during the mentored phase (K99), investigates why CRF1 binds proteins differently in males vs. females. There are no sex differences in CRF1 structure, so I will learn proteomic approaches to identify whether sex differences in post-translational modifications of CRF1 account for these effects. Aims 2 and 3 will be completed during the independent phase. Aim 2 will identify the hormones that contribute to the sex difference in CRF1. To this end, I will combine previously acquired endocrine techniques with the skills learned during the K99 phase to determine whether ovarian or testicular hormones establish the sex differences. Aim 3 will evaluate whether sex differences extend to the other receptor subtype, CRF2, in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Because CRF1 and CRF2 share a high degree of sequence identity, proteomic approaches are expected to reveal sex differences in the CRF2. CRF2 activation of the dorsal raphe-5-HT system promotes a passive behavioral response strategy to stress that is a risk factor for depression. Thus, sex differences in CRF2 may contribute to the increased vulnerability of females this disorder. By addressing these questions, this proposal will help elucidate the etiology of sex differences in stress-related disorders. Moreover, because CRF antagonists are being developed to treat these illnesses, considering sex differences in CRF receptors may increase the efficacy of these compounds in women.  Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, however the biological basis of this sex difference remains unknown. The proposed research will identify molecular and hormonal changes that increase the function of a critical stress-related neuropeptide in female rats. This project will not only help us understand why women are more vulnerable to stress-related mental illnesses, but it will identify new pharmaceutical targets which can lead to treatments that are efficacious in both men and women.",Sex Differences in Stress Receptors Underlie Female Vulnerability to Stress,8469985,R00MH092438,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human

"Psychobiology of Racial Minority Stress and Cellular Aging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. H. David Chae, Sc.D., M.A., is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education at the Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University. He has an established history of conducting research on social and psychological determinants of health in racial minority populations. He has consistently applied his expertise and diverse academic training, in psychology, sociology, and public health, to examine factors associated with racial minority status and health. More specifically, his research has focused on racial discrimination and dimensions of racial identity i relation to mental health, health behaviors, as well as physical disease outcomes associated with aging among racial minority populations.  The scope of Dr. Chae's work on psychosocial factors associated with racial minority health would be considerably enriched through additional training aimed at gaining a broad foundation of knowledge on psychobiological stress pathways, and more in-depth knowledge on telomere maintenance and function. Acquiring this solid background would allow him to conduct epidemiologic studies integrating biomarkers of inflammation and endocrine stress markers, in addition to research examining leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a novel marker of cumulative life stress and systemic aging at the physiologic level. Examining LTL may be particularly informative in studying the impact of racial minority stress which is experienced across the life- course. These activities are complemented by additional training in advanced biostatistical modeling (latent variable analysis), which add to his existing skills in the use of traditional epidemiologic methods. Latent class/profile analysis (LCA/LPA) will be used to empirically derive groups of participants distinguished along physiologic indicators of stress, and explicitly applies the knowledge gained in psychobiological stress mechanisms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to model hypothesized pathways linking racial discrimination and LTL. Additional career development activities emphasized in this application include training in the responsible conduct of research and continued professional development, through presentations at scientific conferences, the publication of manuscripts, and the development and submission of an R01 application that builds upon the knowledge that he gains, as well as findings from the proposed research. These activities are facilitated through a combination of mentorship by experts, didactic coursework, workshops, attendance of scientific conferences, and a directed program of reading. The training and development plan includes introductory courses in aging, stress biology, psychoneuroimmunology, and behavioral endocrinology; workshops and conferences specifically relevant to psychobiological pathways associated with aging and telomere maintenance and function; courses and workshops on latent variable analysis and statistical programming; as well as those focused on research ethics and grant writing. Integrating this substantive and methodological knowledge into his existing work represents an important step towards developing a trans- disciplinary research portfolio that spans the social and basic sciences; and his career goal to lead collaborative, multi-disciplinary teams including those with expertise in diverse fields, including epidemiology, sociology, psychology, neuroscience, and molecular biology in studying racial disparities in aging.  Each of the training and development activities included in this application are applied towards the research plan, which involves examining data from three studies - the Heart and Soul Study (HSS); the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA); and the Bay Area Heart Health Study (BAHHS). Analysis of these three datasets is aimed at: (1) identifying inflammatory markers and endocrine markers of stress that cluster with LTL and subsequently predict aging-related health outcomes, thereby providing evidence for biological mechanisms impacting LTL and disease processes; (2) examining whether racial discrimination is associated with LTL, and identifying psychological and biological factors that may be on the pathway linking this exposure and outcome; and (3) exploring other psychosocial factors associated with racial minority status, such as affective and cognitive responses to racial discrimination, coping, racial identity, in-group racial bias, and racial socialization, which may also impact LTL and aging-related disease outcomes. Each aspect of the training component of this application is applied in innovative ways to the research plan; and together they represent a holistic approach to studying factors and pathways associated with aging-related disease outcomes. Emory University serves as an ideal base to achieve the career development and research objectives outlined in this application, given its history of excellence in both the social and biological sciences, and emphasis on inter-disciplinary educational programs. Emory University commits substantial institutional investment, including financial and intellectual resources to ensure the success of this application and progress towards becoming an independent investigator. A specific objective of this application is to submit an R01 grant focused on identifying risk factors associated with LTL among racial minority groups, by applying the broad knowledge on the psychobiology of aging and training in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of LTL data; and the research findings obtained from this application. Through this award, Dr. Chae will be well- positioned to achieve his goal of developing a research agenda that bridges social epidemiology, psychology, and biology in understanding racial disparities in aging-related diseases.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Studies consistently indicate that African American men experience premature declines in health and have higher rates of early mortality compared to other racial and gender groups, and that these disparities can in part be explained by the disproportionate experience of psychosocial stressors, including experiences of racial discrimination. However, there are gaps in knowledge on the biological mechanisms engaged in the stress response which can help to understand how psychosocial stressors are physiologically embedded and generate racial disparities in health. This application is relevant to the science of how race-specific social stressors accelerate physiologic deterioration at the biological level, measured using leukocyte telomere length, a novel marker of cumulative life stress; and contributes to understanding the sources of racial disparities in aging-related disease outcomes.                   Studies consistently indicate that African American men experience premature declines in health and have higher rates of early mortality compared to other racial and gender groups, and that these disparities can in part be explained by the disproportionate experience of psychosocial stressors, including experiences of racial discrimination.

"Stress and Type 2 Diabetes among Indigenous Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised RO1 application is in response to the Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases Program Announcement (PA-09-262). It focuses on American Indians (AI) whose rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the highest in the world. This population also copes with disproportionate stressors including economic disadvantage, unemployment, community violence, discrimination, and the long- term effects of historical cultural traumas and losses. Yet, paradoxically, AI people tend to score lower on some self-report measures of stress and have lower prevalence rates of stress-related mental disorders such as major depressive episode and anxiety disorders. The goals of the proposed research are to advance measurement of stress processes among AI people through comparisons of stress biomarkers and self-report measures; and to use multiple indicators of stress including stress biomarkers to investigate the interactions between stress processes T2D disease progression and treatment compliance among AI adults. This community based participatory research is based on partnerships with five Ojibwe reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin who invited the research team to work with their clinics. The first specific aim is to couple our existing preliminary data on community salient stressors with new qualitative feedback on existing measures to adapt and subsequently examine via pilot surveys the psychometric properties of stress measures for this population. The second specific aim is to investigate the relationship between stress biomarkers and self-reported psychosocial stressors, symptoms of distress, and diagnostic measures of anxiety, depression, and trauma to ascertain the degree to which self report measures are indicative of actual physiological stress levels among a cohort of 200 AI adults who have been recently diagnosed with T2D. The third specific aim is to follow a cohort of 200 recently diagnosed T2D AI adults for two years to investigate an innovative conceptual model (Figure 1) of multiple measures of stress processes, treatment compliance, mental health, and risk factors for disease complications        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This health disparities research will advance our understanding of stress processes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) among American Indian (AI) people by refining measures of stress among this population through use of stress biomarkers and cultural adaptation/development of self-report stress measures.

"The Intergenerational Transmission of Race Disparities in Health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am seeking a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in Population Research to achieve the following career goals: 1) to apply my interdisciplinary biodemographic training and emphasis in the underlying biological mechanisms mediating social inequality, stress, and health to studying black-white differences in health outcomes, 2) identify race differences in the persistence and pathways of manifested health disparities, and 3) to initiate interdisciplinary dialogue and program development for training scholars in the social and biological interactions that contribute to disparate health outcomes. My prior training and research in family, mental health, and social inequality, along with my excellent quantitative methodological skills, provide a strong interdisciplinary foundation. A K01 would expand on this groundwork by integrating groundbreaking biodemographic perspectives and techniques measuring how social inequality 'gets under the skin' to make people sick. The proposed training in understanding the biology of stress integrates training with non-human primate and human models, under the supervision of my exceptional mentors and advisory committee. This novel training will place me in a unique position to contribute to an interdisciplinary community of scholars and policy makers regarding the mechanisms through which inequality contributes to health declines in vulnerable populations. My mentors, biodemographer Mark Hayward and medical sociologist Les Whitbeck, will supervise my training and scholarly development. The research plan incorporates coursework in biodemography, psychobiology, and neurobiology, endocrinology, and research methods in human biology. This integrative curricula will be applied to several complementary aspects of the project including implementing 1) a biomarker pilot study on social stressors and biological measures of stress and health in white and black mothers and their offspring, and secondary data analysis 2) examining black-white differences in the pathways of early life course illness onset using the Add-Health, PSID, and NLSY, and 3) the degree to which there are race differences in the intergenerational persistence of disparate health outcomes using the PSID and NLSY. Overall this award will allow me to 1) gain expertise in biodemographic methods and the biology of stress and illness, 2) the protected time needed to complete my research plan applying theory and methodology, 3) to present my results at conferences and publish results in peer reviewed journals and 4) to prepare an innovative R01 grant proposal to initiate my career as an independent scholar. This award will establish me as an independent investigator in biodemography with the knowledge and skills to communicate across disciplines about the etiology of race differences in health and strategies we may use to alleviate such differences.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Black-white differences in health outcomes have increased over the last 50 years in the U.S. with blacks being at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. While differences have been described, less is known about 1) the underlying biological processes that contribute to these population based health differences, 2) the contribution of early life course social factors associated with such disparities, and 3) black-white differences in the persistence of these differences across generations. By systematically addressing these issues we may identify policies and programs to alleviate health disparities.

"Stress, Gene-Environment Interaction and Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Although psychosocial stress has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of cardiovascular disease, empirical verifications of the effects of stress and the biological mechanisms through which stress operates remain rare. A major limitation has been the absence of population studies with direct biologic measures of stress (such as measures of levels of stress hormones), so that their link to social antecedents and to biological precursors of cardiovascular disease can be studied. It has also become increasingly apparent that social conditions and stressors must interact with genetic makeup, and that some of these exposures may modify gene expression through changes in DNA methylation but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the gene-environment interactions and epigenetic changes related to psychosocial factors. A major goal of this project is to better understand the ways in which socially patterned stress interacts with genetics and biology to influence cardiovascular-related outcomes. Using data from the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a large, multiethnic population sample, we propose to investigate long-term associations of the stress response (as characterized by multiple measures of stress hormones) with social/psychosocial antecedents and cardiovascular-related outcomes, as well as modifications of the stress response by variations in selected candidate genes, and links between psychosocial factors and epigenetic changes. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of repeat measures of stress hormones with social and psychosocial factors and with biological precursors of cardiovascular disease including inflammation/hemostasis and measures of insulin resistance and adiposity; (2) To examine interactions between cortisol levels and polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor gene with respect to cardiovascular-related outcomes; (3) To examine the extent to which polymorphisms of biologically relevant genes modify the response to a psychological stress challenge; and (4) To examine epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) of the glucocorticoid receptor gene as well as genomic DNA methylation and their association with (a) lifecourse social exposures; (b) cortisol and hemodynamic responses to a stress challenge; and (c) biological parameters previously linked to stress exposures. Our study will enhance our understanding not only of the epidemiologic links between stress and cardiovascular disease but also of the biologic mechanisms (involving genetic polymorphisms and changes to gene expression) through which these effects may be mediated. By illustrating how the study of genetic variability, biological markers, and social conditions can be integrated to enhance our understanding of the causes of ill health our project has the potential for contributing to major paradigmatic change in health research.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been argued that stress may be important to the development of cardiovascular disease, but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the way in which stress operates. This study will investigate the links between stress and biological factors important to cardiovascular disease, including the interactions between stress and genes. This approach is necessary to better understand the importance of stress and to develop preventative interventions.

"Stress and Health Among Sexual Minority Immigrants    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Disparities in mental health and health services utilization are crucial public health and social justice concerns. Prior research has established differences in mental and physical health between different subsets of the US population, including differences between ethnic groups and between people who differ in sexual orientation. These disparities may be linked to experiences of prejudice, discrimination, and stigmatization that are common in the lives of both racial/ethnic minorities and lesbian, gay, and bisexual people (i.e., sexual minorities) and that may be even greater among individuals who are also immigrants to the US. The proposed two-study, two-year research project is guided by a conceptual model of minority stress that identifies potential causes, moderators, and mediators, some that derive from interactions with the ""dominant"" culture and some from associations with similarly stigmatized individuals, that impact the mental health of sexual minority immigrants. Specifically, in Study 1 a large and representative public health dataset of California residents will be used to test predictions about disparities in mental health and health services utilization as a function of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, immigrant status, and combinations of these characteristics. In addition, a complementary research approach, interviews, will be utilized in Study 2 to learn about sources of and experiences with minority stress directly from sexual minority immigrants (specifically Asian and Latino), as well as about their coping resources and activities. For Study 1, and based on minority stress frameworks, poorer health and less utilization are expected for stigmatized individuals, but especially among individuals who possess multiple stigmatizing characteristics. Analyses of the Study 2 first-person accounts will focus on identifying themes across and between participants in order to explicate minority stress theoretical constructs, write items of future research, and to provide context for understanding the Study 1 findings. Thus, the specific aims of this project include assessing health disparities 1) as a function of gender and ethnic, sexual minority, and immigrant statuses separately, and 2) as a function of combined multiple minority characteristics. 3) In addition, subjective experiences related to the possible moderators and mechanisms identified in the proposed conceptual model linking stigmatizing characteristics to poorer health among sexual minority immigrants will be explored. The project is original and timely in focusing on a hidden group of individuals who face unique health risks. It also has the potential to advance scientific knowledge of health disparities, minority stress, and health and well-being, and the results could potentially be used to inform policies, practices, and community programming focused on meeting the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable populations.        Health disparities may be linked to experiences of prejudice, discrimination, and stigmatization that are common in the lives of both racial/ethnic minorities and lesbian, gay, and bisexual people and that may be even greater among immigrants. The proposed research uses complementary quantitative and qualitative research approaches in focusing on health disparities and differences in mental health and health services utilization as a function of gender, ethnicity, immigrant status, sexual orientation, and combinations of these potentially stigmatizing characteristics. Project results will advance scientific knowledge of health disparities, minority stress, and health and well-being, and potentially could be used to inform policies, practices, and community programming focused on meeting the needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable populations.

"Integrative Stress Reduction for Maternal-Child Health The purpose of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to promote the  candidate's development as an independent clinical trial researcher in mind-body medicine with a focus on  reducing disparities in maternal-child health. Rates of preterm birth and low birth weight are increasing and  are persistently higher among vulnerable U.S. populations. Animal and human models consistently implicate  maternal stress as a significant risk factor in the etiology of adverse birth outcomes. Maladaptive patterns in  hormonal and cardiovascular aspects of the stress response appear to be linked with preterm birth and low  birth weight. In addition, psychological stress and poor coping may drive physiological stress responses that  lead to adverse birth outcomes. Dr. Duncan's research, using the framework of revised Stress and Coping  Theory (Folkman, 1997), has shown that pregnant women who learn mind-body practices during pregnancy  report healthy improvements in levels of perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety, mindfulness, positive and  negative affect, and depression in the perinatal period. The candidate seeks additional training in the design  and conduct of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of mind-body interventions and understanding of  physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying the stress response during pregnancy. The  University of California, San Francisco is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides  access to experts in RCT methodology, integrative medicine, and the basic sciences of psychological and  physiological aspects of the stress response, including the physiology of human pregnancy. The training  plan includes formal coursework, informal tutorials with experts in their respective fields, and supervision of  Dr. Duncan's leadership as PI on an RCT assessing the efficacy of a mind-body enhanced version of an  existing, culturally-sensitive, group-based model of prenatal healthcare delivery. Rigorous testing of  hypotheses regarding the impact of the mind-body practices will occur by comparing the effects of the mindbody  enhanced program with the standard program. Effects of each intervention on psychological stress and  coping mechanisms, stress physiology (neuroendocrine and cardiovascular/ autonomic nervous system  function), and birth outcomes (gestational age and birth weight) will be compared. The results of the study  will provide initial information about whether a mind-body intervention targeted to reduce stress during the  perinatal period through mindfulness may provide clinical benefit for improving birth outcomes, thus  informing development of an R01 proposal and advancing the long term goal of reducing health disparities. Maternal stress is consistently linked with preterm birth and low birth weight. The integrative stress reduction  intervention being tested targets psychological stress and coping, stress hormones, and cardiovascular  stress reactivity through mindfulness practices. If the enhanced intervention is effective, it will help to  address a key public health problem and may help reduce health disparities in maternal-child health.",Integrative Stress Reduction for

"Health Disparities and Stress Hypothesis  R. Jay Turner, PhD Principal Investigator ABSTRACT  This application argues that progress in understanding the origins of racial and socioeconomic position (SEP) disparities has been impeded by several problems, the two most important of which are the problem of misclassification and the failure to adequately assess differences in stress exposure. In our view, information on the origins of health disparities can most effectively be pursued by an approach that avoids the typical classification error of counting disordered individuals as non-disordered because they do not exhibit the particular disease or disorder under investigation or have a nascent disorder that has not progressed enough to be clinically detectable. We suggest that such misclassification is likely to have obscured potentially modifiable factors that are centrally implicated in the documented elevation in health risk among African Americans and persons of low SEP, and argue that it can be avoided by a joining of biomarker methodologies for estimating physical health status and reliable estimates of the presence of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems within a community-based population study. There is also evidence indicating that the failure of prior research to take account of a range of social stressors has significantly biased estimates of racial and SEP differences in exposure to stress and resulted in the systematic underestimation of the contributions of stress exposure to the occurrence of racial and SEP disparities in health. Among the unique aspects of the proposed research are: 1) the substantial avoidance of epidemiologic misclassification through the simultaneous consideration of one or more operationalizations of allostatic load and the assessment of cell aging, in combination with both clinical and subclinical assessments of psychiatric and substance use disorders/problems; 2) estimation of stress exposure in terms of lifetime exposure to major and potential traumatic events, recent life events, chronic stressors, discrimination stress, and, among African Americans, stress arising from colorism and from uncertainty and/or ambiguity associated with covert discrimination; and 3) in the context provided by 1 and 2 above, to assess an exceptionally comprehensive array of hypothesized risk/protective factors including, through a subsequent grant application, gene-environment interactions. We will study a representative community-based sample of 1600 adults, ages 25 to 65 selected such that half are African American, half are female, and sufficient numbers of middle and upper SEP African Americans who do and do not live in segregated areas are included to allow at least substantial disentanglement of the effects of race, SEP, and segregation. The research proposed is aimed toward the identification of potentially modifiable social, contextual, and personal factors that contribute to racial and SEP health disparities.  R.

"Caregiver Stress: Interventions to Promote Health and Wellbeing DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This Program Project aims to promote health and reduce cardiovascular risk in family caregivers of persons with chronic illness. As family caregivers provide physical, psychosocial, and instrumental care to their loved ones with prolonged and progressive health conditions, they often experience tremendous burden while balancing other life demands. Chronic intense caregiving represents a situation of chronic stress, which takes a toll on health through a cascade of deleterious physiological stress processes. Along with caregivers' lack of attention to their own health promotion, risk of cardiovascular disease, in particular, is a major concern. Few studies have explored self-care interventions for family caregivers especially targeted to improve coping with the stressful circumstances and also to ameliorate the harmful effects of chronic stress ultimately associated with cardiovascular risk. In two studies, using a psychoneuroimmunological approach, we will test two interventions, psycho-education and physical exercise, individually and in combination. The first study will target family caregivers of African American dementia patients; the second will focus on family caregivers of heart failure patients. Parallel designs, interventions and measures will create synergy as will integration of all data management and analyses within a Biobehavioral Science and Measures Core. This Core will also provide high level guidance and interpretation of model testing resulting from analysis of the common data set. The combined data set will allow for elucidating the neuroendocrine mechanisms of stress-induced cardiovascular risk, further developing the model, and stimulating future research, while the shared core support will provide substantial efficiency; neither could be achieved outside of a Program Project approach. These collective efforts will generate important data whereby future care can significantly enhance the lives of family caregivers and minimize their risk of cardiovascular disease, the number one cause of disability and death in the United States. More and more family members are providing care to their loved ones with prolonged and progressive illnesses. Chronic intense caregiving represents a situation of chronic stress, which takes a toll on one's mental and physical health including an increased risk for the development or worsening of heart disease. Identification of effective self-care interventions for family caregivers is warranted to improve their emotional wellbeing and minimize the harmful effects of chronic stress on the heart.",Caregiver Stress: Interventions to Promote Health and Wellbeing,8310812,P01NR011587,"['Attention ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Leadership ', ' Manuals ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Patients ', ' Psychiatrist ', ' Psychiatry ', ' psychoneuroimmunological ', ' Psychoneuroimmunology ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' School Health Nursing ', ' School Nursing ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Stress ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Test Result ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' data management ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavior measurement ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Nursing Research ', ' Research Program Projects ', ' Program Project Grant ', ' P01 Program ', ' P01 Mechanism ', ' Program Research Project Grants ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' psychoeducational intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' loved ones ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,P01,2012,646691,0.06969571218820786
"Role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and social stress on perinatal outcomes  Project Summary/Abstract The goal of my K99/R00 career development plan is to launch an independent research program in reproductive and environmental epidemiology of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which includes evaluating social determinants of health that may affect overlapping biologic pathways. To accomplish this goal, I will enhance my expertise in environmental health sciences with didactic and hands-on training in reproductive biology, social epidemiology/stress science, and environmental epidemiologic methods. This specialized training will allow me to achieve my long term goal of becoming an independent academic investigator and offering new insights on the cumulative impacts of environmental and social factors on reproductive health.  The primary goal of my research plan is to evaluate the independent effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and psychosocial stress on thyroid hormone disruption and consequent perinatal outcomes among a population of socioeconomically and racially diverse pregnant women. This work is particularly innovative as both PBDEs and psychosocial stress can impact the thyroid system, suggesting a biologic plausibility for interaction, however the two exposures have never been examined simultaneously in a human study. During the K99 mentored phase, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tracey Woodruff, I will use innovative measures to characterize biologically-relevant exposures to PBDEs and psychosocial stress and their effects on thyroid hormone disruption. Exposure to PBDEs will be assessed using both PBDE congeners as well as their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PBDEs). Psychosocial stress will be evaluated with subjective measures of stress and telomere length, a biomarker of cellular aging that is influenced by psychosocial stress. In the independent phase, I will apply this knowledge to investigate the independent effects of PBDEs and psychosocial stress on adverse perinatal outcomes, such as gestational hypertension, preterm birth, and low birth weight, and assess whether these effects are mediated via the thyroid system. The integration of this work will enable me to develop the necessary methodological and biological frameworks to examine the combined, and potentially synergistic, effects of environmental and psychosocial factors on perinatal outcomes in future R01 studies. I am well positioned to accomplish these goals at the University of California, San Francisco, a highly respected research institution, with a strong environmental reproductive health program, a world-renowned faculty with expertise in psychosocial stress, and an extensive biomedical infrastructure. My primary mentor and co-mentors in reproductive sciences, environmental epidemiology, health disparities, stress science, and biostatistics will guide the process whereby I learn the methods that are required to accomplish the goals set forth in this proposal. This project represents the cutting-edge of health disparities and environmental health research and seeks to answer critical scientific as well as policy-relevant questions for improving the health of vulnerable populations who often face disproportionate and elevated exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors.    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to prepare Dr. Ami Zota to transition to a position as an independent academic investigator in environmental health sciences focusing on the consequence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy and social factors that may affect overlapping biologic pathways. She will conduct epidemiologic analyses to investigate the effects of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants and psychosocial stress on perinatal outcomes and assess whether these effects are mediated by the thyroid system. Results from this work will improve pregnancy outcomes and inform public health policy, particularly for vulnerable subpopulations, who often encounter elevated exposures to chemical and non-chemical

"Stress Management Among Latinos with Type 2 Diabetes  Abstract The objectives of this study are to assess the impact of a stress reduction intervention among Latinos with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) served by Hartford Hospital on: a) HbA1c levels, and b) stress reactivity measured through a blood glucose sensor and an automated Interactive Voice Response System (IVR). To obtain 200 study completers, 250 Latinos with T2D will be recruited from the 'Amigos en Salud' clinic. They will be randomly assigned to either: a) the control group that will receive 3 community health worker (CHW)led nutrition educational group sessions, or b) the intervention group that in addition will receive an 8-session stress management intervention delivered by a trained CHW. Intervention will be delivered at the Hispanic Health Council in a group format (12 members per group). The primary outcome of the intervention will be HbA1c measured at baseline, post-intervention (9 weeks post-enrollment) and 6 months. The secondary outcome will be stress reactivity measured through an IVR system that involves inserting a metabolic sensor that participants will carry for 3 days as well as daily reporting, via an automated voice system, of stress related events and coping during the same period of time and 6 month s post-enrollment. A subsample (n=75) will participate in the IVR and metabolic sensor measurements conducted pre/post intervention. All study participants will be applied an e-tablet based survey in their homes to assess mental health, nutrition and basic socio-economic and demographic parameters. Blood samples will be collected by a community phlebotomist in the participants' homes at the same time points. Knowledge gained from this randomized trial could lead to a highly innovative CHW led approach to improving the quality of life among individuals with T2D living in very stressful socio-economic environments.  Narrative There are no published studies examining the impact of stress management on metabolic control among Latinos with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

"Biobehavioral Mechanisms Linking Stress and Obesity in Low-Income Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Highly stressed and impoverished populations are more likely to be obese, and ultimately more likely to develop obesity-associated comorbidities. Preventing these adverse health outcomes relies on preventing the development of obesity early in the life span, since obesity, once established, tends to persist and prevention is more effective than treatment. Preventing obesity is highly urgent for low-income children, since obesity is common early on in this demographic and may contribute to substantial health disparities later in life. Current prevention programs have limited effectiveness, and novel targets for intervention are needed. The association between stress and eating behavior is one potential novel target. Our research program focuses on links between stress, eating behavior, and obesity in low-income children. Our preliminary findings suggest that, in early childhood, patterns of cortisol secretion reflecting chronic stress may promote eating in the absence of hunger, reduced satiety responsiveness, and tantrums over food; these eating behaviors, in turn, may lead to obesity. This early work has made clear, however, that the pathways linking stress to obesity via eating behavior are complex and multifactorial, and involve biologic and behavioral pathways. To date we have examined only a subset of eating behaviors that could mediate links between stress and obesity. Other mechanisms that may be affected by stress, such as high sensitivity to food as a reward or poor ability to delay gratification for food, have not been examined in this model. How such eating behaviors may cluster and develop over time, how different aspects of stress (i.e., chronic vs. immediate stressors) relate to these behaviors, and how genotypes may moderate such associations remains unknown. We propose to examine how these processes may be driven by stress, and ultimately lead to obesity in children. This application is submitted in response to RFA- HL-12-037: ""Mechanistic Pathways Linking Psychosocial Stress and Behavior"" with the goal of providing a deeper understanding of the psychological and bio-behavioral processes that connect psychosocial stress with eating behaviors and ultimately obesity. The aims are: Aim 1: To examine the cross-sectional relationship of psychosocial stress (chronic and immediate stress) with obesity-promoting eating behaviors (including satiety responsiveness, reinforcing value of food, and the ability to delay gratification for food) and body mass index (BMI) z-score at age 7 years among low-income children. Aim 2: To test genetic moderators of stress-eating behavior links in our cohort of low-income children. Aim 3: To examine longitudinal associations of chronic stress and reactivity to stress early in life (age 3 years) with changes in obesity-promoting eating behaviors between ages 3 and 7 years. Improved understanding of the development of associations of psychosocial stress during early life with specific, well-phenotyped eating behaviors and excessive weight gain beginning in childhood may hold promise for novel obesity prevention efforts among low-income children, a demographic group at high risk.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Psychosocial stress is linked with overeating and the development of obesity, but the mechanisms underlying these associations are not well-understood, particularly in children. Improved understanding of the development of associations of social-contextual and interpersonal stress with eating behavior and excessive weight gain beginning in childhood may hold promise for novel targets for obesity prevention. Given that psychosocial stress and obesity are both more common among low-income children, the work may also hold particular promise for addressing socioeconomic disparities in obesity prevalence.            ",Biobehavioral Mechanisms Linking Stress and Obesity in Low-Income Children,8549242,R01DK098983,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Asthma ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Food ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Phenotype ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' satiety ', ' Satiation ', ' preschool ', ' Nursery Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Work ', ' DRD2 Receptor ', ' D2 receptor ', ' Dopamine D2 Receptor ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Stimulus ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Genetic ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' genetic testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' obesity prevention ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' child well being ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' three year old ', ' age 3 years ', ' 3 year old ', ' seven year old ', ' age 7 years ', ' 7 year old ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' eating in absence of hunger ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2013,478380,0.10211005917815696
"Air pollution, stress and urban child development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasingly, prospective epidemiological studies link maternal stress during pregnancy with adverse neurodevelopment in children. Recent evidence also suggests that perinatal ambient air pollution exposure may have neurotoxic effects. While historically research has focused on how social and physical environmental factors independently affect children's health, evolving research underscores the importance of studying interactive effects. Moreover, marginalized populations of lower-socioeconomic position (SEP) are exposed disproportionately to traffic- related pollutants while living in adverse social circumstances or communities that are ""socially"" toxic. Consequently, these populations experience both increased stress and increased chemical pollution. Social x chemical interactions may account for more variance in explaining risk than the main effects of either factor alone. Relevant studies in urban populations are rare and none assess stress and air pollution together. Studies of mechanistic pathways linking perinatal air pollution and/or stress to neurodevelopment are equally sparse. We take advantage of an established pregnancy cohort - the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS) project (R01 HL080674, RJ Wright PI), with prospectively characterized exposure to ambient pollutants starting in pregnancy coupled with extensive assessment of pre- and postnatal stress, as well as relevant confounders and mediators. We can draw from our biomarker archive including assessments of prenatal maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (e.g., cortisol), infant autonomic nervous system (ANS) and HPA axis function at age 6 months, and DNA banked for future genetic assays to explore mechanisms. In this application, we are proposing the addition of neurocognitive and behavioral testing in n=815 ACCESS children at age 6 years. We will then test the main effects of perinatal exposure to chronic ambient air pollution and/or psychological stress on these neuropsychiatric outcomes. We will next examine whether air pollution effects are modified by psychosocial stress. Mechanisms to be explored include perinatal stress (& air pollution)-elicited disruption in the maternal prenatal HPA axis and the child's HPA axis and ANS response. Finally, to further explore biological mechanisms by which air pollutants and stress impact neurodevelopment, genetic susceptibility factors will be examined.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the effects of perinatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution on childhood neurobehavioral and cognitive development in urban children. In addition to independent effects of air pollution, the study will also examine the potential modifying effects of the social environment (i.e., psychological stress) and genetic susceptibility on these relationships. Such knowledge may inform efforts to design programs that improve neurodevelopmental trajectories in high-risk urban populations disproportionately exposed to adverse physical and social environments.

"Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Black Americans carry a disproportionate burden of social risk factors for poor mental health, such as living in violent urban environments and experiencing economic deprivation and discrimination. Despite these risks, Black Americans have lower lifetime prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders than Whites. The reasons for Black Americans' resilience to these mental health disorders are unknown. This proposal aims to examine cumulative adversity and subsequent diminished neurobiological stress response as a possible explanation of Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and depression. It also aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this resilience. These aims will be accomplished by conducting research interviews with 1,306 young adults (age 20-21; 60% Black, 40% White; 50% female) from an existing community sample who have been previously assessed three times during childhood and adolescence. These research interviews will provide information on adversity experienced by the participants, categorical diagnoses and dimensional measures of internalizing distress, and physiological indicators of reactivity to stress. Neural bases of stress response will be evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for a subset of 120 Black and 120 White participants from the larger study. This study is innovative because it proposes to test a novel mechanism explaining the resilience of Black Americans to depression and anxiety, incorporates both categorical and dimensional measures of internalizing problems, and examines the role of physiological stress response and regulatory neural circuit in the resilience process. The results will have important implications for our understanding of racial disparities i anxiety and depression, neurobiological mechanisms underlying resilience to stress, and relationships between environmental stress, neural and physiological response, and negative affect. These findings will point to novel ways to diagnose and treat mental health problems in Black and White Americans.          Black Americans are exposed to more adversity than White Americans, yet they experience lower rates of anxiety and depressive disorders. The proposed project investigates cumulative adversity and diminished neurobiological stress response as causal mechanisms underlying Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and mood disorders. The findings will improve our understanding of the role of adversity and neurobiological stress system in anxiety and depression and suggest novel approaches to diagnose and treat these mental health problems in Black and White Americans.

"Sex Differences in Stress Receptors Underlie Female Vulnerability to Stress   Stress-related psychiatric disorders, like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are debilitating mental illnesses that affect twice as many women as men. Although the etiology of this disparity remains unknown, it is thought to be due to sex differences in stress responses. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) orchestrates stress responses, in part, by regulating norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transmission, and CRF is dysregulated in stress-related disorders. The goal of my current research is to identify sex differences in a receptor for CRF (CRF1 subtype) that may account for sex differences in stress responsivity. To date, I found that CRF1 signals and is trafficked differently in female rats in a manner that can account for elevated responses to acute stress and decreased adaptation to chronic stress. In females, CRF1 immunoprecipitation revealed a greater coupling to Gs, the GTP-binding protein that mediates most cellular responses. Additionally, stress-induced CRF1 association with ¿-arrestin2, an integral step in receptor internalization, was apparent in males but not females. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed stress-induced CRF1 internalization in male rats only, suggesting that this adaptive process to compensate for large amounts of CRF, as may be released in depression, is compromised in females. Importantly, sex differences in CRF1 function rendered NE neurons in the locus coeruleus of female rats more sensitive to low levels of CRF and less adaptable to high levels of CRF. However, because this is the first report of sex differences in stress- related neuropeptide receptor, many questions remain unanswered. Aim 1 of this proposal, which will be completed during the mentored phase (K99), investigates why CRF1 binds proteins differently in males vs. females. There are no sex differences in CRF1 structure, so I will learn proteomic approaches to identify whether sex differences in post-translational modifications of CRF1 account for these effects. Aims 2 and 3 will be completed during the independent phase. Aim 2 will identify the hormones that contribute to the sex difference in CRF1. To this end, I will combine previously acquired endocrine techniques with the skills learned during the K99 phase to determine whether ovarian or testicular hormones establish the sex differences. Aim 3 will evaluate whether sex differences extend to the other receptor subtype, CRF2, in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Because CRF1 and CRF2 share a high degree of sequence identity, proteomic approaches are expected to reveal sex differences in the CRF2. CRF2 activation of the dorsal raphe-5-HT system promotes a passive behavioral response strategy to stress that is a risk factor for depression. Thus, sex differences in CRF2 may contribute to the increased vulnerability of females this disorder. By addressing these questions, this proposal will help elucidate the etiology of sex differences in stress-related disorders. Moreover, because CRF antagonists are being developed to treat these illnesses, considering sex differences in CRF receptors may increase the efficacy of these compounds in women.  Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, however the biological basis of this sex difference remains unknown. The proposed research will identify molecular and hormonal changes that increase the function of a critical stress-related neuropeptide in female rats. This project will not only help us understand why women are more vulnerable to stress-related mental illnesses, but it will identify new pharmaceutical targets which can lead to treatments that are efficacious in both men and women.",Sex Differences in Stress Receptors Underlie Female Vulnerability to Stress,8530285,R00MH092438,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human

"Stress, Gene-Environment Interaction and Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by investigator): Although psychosocial stress has been hypothesized to play a role in the etiology of cardiovascular disease, empirical verifications of the effects of stress and the biological mechanisms through which stress operates remain rare. A major limitation has been the absence of population studies with direct biologic measures of stress (such as measures of levels of stress hormones), so that their link to social antecedents and to biological precursors of cardiovascular disease can be studied. It has also become increasingly apparent that social conditions and stressors must interact with genetic makeup, and that some of these exposures may modify gene expression through changes in DNA methylation but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the gene-environment interactions and epigenetic changes related to psychosocial factors. A major goal of this project is to better understand the ways in which socially patterned stress interacts with genetics and biology to influence cardiovascular-related outcomes. Using data from the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a large, multiethnic population sample, we propose to investigate long-term associations of the stress response (as characterized by multiple measures of stress hormones) with social/psychosocial antecedents and cardiovascular-related outcomes, as well as modifications of the stress response by variations in selected candidate genes, and links between psychosocial factors and epigenetic changes. The Specific Aims of the project are: (1) To examine associations of repeat measures of stress hormones with social and psychosocial factors and with biological precursors of cardiovascular disease including inflammation/hemostasis and measures of insulin resistance and adiposity; (2) To examine interactions between cortisol levels and polymorphisms of the glucocorticoid receptor gene with respect to cardiovascular-related outcomes; (3) To examine the extent to which polymorphisms of biologically relevant genes modify the response to a psychological stress challenge; and (4) To examine epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) of the glucocorticoid receptor gene as well as genomic DNA methylation and their association with (a) lifecourse social exposures; (b) cortisol and hemodynamic responses to a stress challenge; and (c) biological parameters previously linked to stress exposures. Our study will enhance our understanding not only of the epidemiologic links between stress and cardiovascular disease but also of the biologic mechanisms (involving genetic polymorphisms and changes to gene expression) through which these effects may be mediated. By illustrating how the study of genetic variability, biological markers, and social conditions can be integrated to enhance our understanding of the causes of ill health our project has the potential for contributing to major paradigmatic change in health research.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been argued that stress may be important to the development of cardiovascular disease, but few population studies have comprehensively investigated the way in which stress operates. This study will investigate the links between stress and biological factors important to cardiovascular disease, including the interactions between stress and genes.

"Setting a trajectory: biological markers of early stress and child development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To identify at-risk children precise indicators of the biological changes associated with early life adversity, including prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and racial disparities are needed. Without reliable indicators capable of providing mechanistic insight the ability to design and implement innovative interventions, and alter negative developmental trajectories, remains limited. Alterations in the stress response system, determined by salivary cortisol levels, are associated with PNMS. Disrupted parent-child attachment, as well as the therapeutic repair of this relationship, has also been found to influence the cortisol response in infants. However, the stress hypo-responsive period in early childhood may limit the utility of cortisol as a stand-alone indicator during this critical developmental time point. Additionally, while cortisol indicates dysregulation in the HPA axis it provides minimal mechanistic information. The established role of genetic and epigenetic factors, including FKBP5 and miRNAs, to both the responsiveness and adaptation of the HPA axis suggest they play an important role in the underlying mechanism. Concurrent measurement of gene expression, miRNA, and cortisol is expected to more robustly define how early adversity is biological embedded. Saliva represents an ideal accessible biological source that reflects an individual's complex internal milieu. Recent evidence indicates that mRNA, miRNA and telomere length can be reliably measured in saliva. Studies have also demonstrated changes in each of these markers with exposure to early adversity and stress. These collective findings indicate that an epigenetic psychophysiological profile concurrently measuring each component is feasible and a critical next step in research seeking to chart the trajectory of mental illness and define the earliest intervention time points. This study expects to enroll infants of African American women with extensive characterization of PNMS and maternal preconception adversity. Saliva will be collected pre and post a known stressor designed to activate the HPA axis at two early developmental time points. Infants will be stressed before (4 months, using the Still Face Procedure) and after (12 months, using the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP)) the development of attachment. The cortisol response to the stressor, fold change in FKBP5 mRNA pre/post the stressor as well as initial levels of miR-134 and miR-16 and telomere length will be determined. Leveraging the increased statistical power associated with propensity score matching this proposal will test the association between PNMS, attachment and salivary markers while controlling for preconception adversity. Achievement of the proposal aims of this proposal is expected to provide enhanced biological evidence in support of the implementation of attachment based interventions early in the life course. The critical need to more effectively address persistent health disparities and decrease the negative health outcomes associated with toxic stress requires the development of innovative methodologies that both define biological mechanisms and track the effectiveness of interventions at the behavioral, physiologic, and molecular level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because an enhanced mechanistic understanding of the biological embedding of early adversity is ultimately expected to lead to novel interventions and preventive efforts that alter the life-long negative health trajectories associated with toxic stress and health disparities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIMH's mission that pertains to strengthening the public health impact of NIMH funded research and to charting mental illness trajectories to determine when to intervene.                ",Setting a trajectory: biological markers of early stress and child development,8573972,R01MH101533,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Motion ', ' premRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' FKBP Rotamase ', ' FKBP ', ' FK506 Binding Proteins ', ' FK-506-Binding Protein ', ' Tacrolimus Binding Proteins ', ' telomere ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Salivary ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' DSM ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' hypothalamic pituitary axis ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Age-Months ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Security ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NIMH,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2013,333567,0.10772012518117609
"Causes and Impact of Minority Stress on Health and Development in Youth    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sexual orientation group disparities in several critical health domains are now well documented, with sexual minorities reporting more psychological distress, substance use and dependence, and eating disorders symptoms. Little is known about the reasons underlying higher risk behaviors among sexual minorities relative to heterosexuals. Herein, we propose to explain these sexual orientation disparities by testing our Sexual Minority Stress Theory (SMST). SMST is based on society's stigmatization of homosexuality. Gay-related stress, the experience by a sexual-minority individual of society's stigmatization, consists of external stressors (such as prejudice, discrimination, verbal abuse, physical violence) perpetrated by known individuals (such as kin, heterosexual friends) and strangers in the community. Gay-related stress also consists of internal stress, in which the sexual-minority individual internalizes society's stigmatization, such as possessing negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Our proposed research will address the impact of gay-related stress on disparities between and among sexual orientation subgroups in psychological distress, physiological distress (cortisol, DHEA), health behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood, and examine moderators, such as the effect of parent-child relationships on the relations between sexual orientation and gay-related stress and the effect of coping on the relations between gay-related stress and both psychological and physiological distress. Gay-related stress may be particularly important in influencing a sexual minority youth's development and psychosocial adjustment in emerging adulthood. Our research will be sensitive to important precursors of gay-related stress, such as gender nonconformity. It will also examine how sex, age at experiencing gay-related stress, sexual minority status and transitions in status, concordant vs. nonconcordant orientation patterns among sexual minorities, and sexual identity development vary with gay-related stress, health, adaptation, and adjustment outcomes. We will collect new self-report survey and biological data to investigate these critical issues in the Growing Up Today Study (GUTS), a longitudinal cohort study of 16,882 U.S. adolescents and emerging adults begun in 1996 and ongoing. Specifically, we will add 3 data collection phases to more than 10 years of data collected from GUTS and link the youths' data with those of their mothers, who comprise the Nurses' Health Study II. We will examine disparities in violence victimization in childhood and adolescence and other forms of gay-related stress and the impact of these over time on subsequent psychological and physiological distress, substance use and eating disordered behaviors, chronic pain, adaptation, and adjustment in emerging adulthood.  PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Disturbing evidence exists of disparities in tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use and dependence, eating disorder symptoms, and a number of other important health indicators adversely affecting sexual-minority youth relative to heterosexual peers. Our proposed research will address the critical need for new epidemiologic investigations into the impact of violence victimization, harassment, and other gay- related stressors on the health of this underserved and understudied population, providing valuable data to researchers and clinicians working to improve the health of all youth.

"Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child Biology and Behavior     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable evidence documenting the effects of prenatal maternal stress and emotions on birth and early child outcomes, the biological pathways by which maternal stress is transferred to children are not yet well understood. The proposed study will test a set of novel hypotheses about maternal stress and allostatic load (physiological dysregulation across multiple systems due to cumulative wear-and-tear associated with chronic and acute stress exposure) during the preconception and prenatal periods. The study focuses primarily on HPA axis regulatory mechanisms in a sample of 201 diverse mother-child pairs, particularly the prediction of child neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress regulation at ages 2 and 3 and cellular aging (indexed by telomere length) in both young children and their mothers. Our inclusion of the preconception period is innovative and yields a more comprehensive understanding of developmental origins (including fetal programming) of later health and developmental competence. One overall objective is to identify modifiable risk factors that can be targeted for early effective prevention of adverse health, neurocognitive, and behavioral outcomes throughout the lifespan.  Participants will be recruited from an enrolled cohort of ethnically diverse, mostly low-income women in Washington, DC and Lake County, IL near Chicago as part of a large multi-site NIH collaborative study (Child Community Health Network Study; CCHN). The parent study includes extensive interview measures of maternal stress in preconception and pregnancy and maternal biomarkers that pose risk for disease in the next generation, creating a unique opportunity to examine prospective predictors of child outcomes. The specific aims are to examine effects of maternal stress and allostatic load, especially HPA regulation during preconception and in pregnancy on outcomes at ages 2 and 3. The outcomes are: (1) children's cortisol responses to acute laboratory stressors and circadian regulation of cortisol production; (2) children's fearful or anxious temperament measured by innovative observational laboratory testing; (3) children's neurocognitive functioning using standardized assessments; (4) children's leukocyte telomere length at age 2 and rates of shortening from ages 2 to 3. We will also examine leukocyte telomere length of mothers as a function of stress and test for mother-child associations.  RELEVANCE: This study addresses an NICHD research priority in 2011 to identify developmental origins of susceptibility to later health, disease, and longevity. Results will provide the first evidence about plausible biological pathways prior to pregnancy that, in turn, program prenatal and postnatal development, taking into consideration many other known environmental and biological influences. The findings have the potential to yield new understanding about the pervasive, serious maternal and child health disparities that extend throughout the lifespan and disproportionately impact low income, minority populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adult diseases with developmental origins including neurocognitive disorders are estimated to take an immense toll on our nation's health. The proposed research will prospectively investigate whether maternal factors in the preconception period and in pregnancy, especially stress and HPA regulatory mechanisms, alter the behavioral, stress regulatory and neurocognitive outcomes of young children, as well as effects on cellular aging processes in mother-child pairs. Findings will provide a new foundation for developing potentially powerful preventive interventions to improve children's lifelong well-being.           ",Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child Biology and Behavior,8440225,R01HD072021,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Stress and Type 2 Diabetes among Indigenous Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised RO1 application is in response to the Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases Program Announcement (PA-09-262). It focuses on American Indians (AI) whose rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the highest in the world. This population also copes with disproportionate stressors including economic disadvantage, unemployment, community violence, discrimination, and the long- term effects of historical cultural traumas and losses. Yet, paradoxically, AI people tend to score lower on some self-report measures of stress and have lower prevalence rates of stress-related mental disorders such as major depressive episode and anxiety disorders. The goals of the proposed research are to advance measurement of stress processes among AI people through comparisons of stress biomarkers and self-report measures; and to use multiple indicators of stress including stress biomarkers to investigate the interactions between stress processes T2D disease progression and treatment compliance among AI adults. This community based participatory research is based on partnerships with five Ojibwe reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin who invited the research team to work with their clinics. The first specific aim is to couple our existing preliminary data on community salient stressors with new qualitative feedback on existing measures to adapt and subsequently examine via pilot surveys the psychometric properties of stress measures for this population. The second specific aim is to investigate the relationship between stress biomarkers and self-reported psychosocial stressors, symptoms of distress, and diagnostic measures of anxiety, depression, and trauma to ascertain the degree to which self report measures are indicative of actual physiological stress levels among a cohort of 200 AI adults who have been recently diagnosed with T2D. The third specific aim is to follow a cohort of 200 recently diagnosed T2D AI adults for two years to investigate an innovative conceptual model (Figure 1) of multiple measures of stress processes, treatment compliance, mental health, and risk factors for disease complications          This health disparities research will advance our understanding of stress processes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) among American Indian (AI) people by refining measures of stress among this population through use of stress biomarkers and cultural adaptation/development of self-report stress measures. It will then prospectively investigate the effects of stress on T2D disease progression by following a cohort of 200 newly diagnosed AI adults for a period of two years.

"Perinatal Programming of Infant Stress Reactivity and the Atopic Phenotype    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biological hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli is a fundamental feature of atopy, predisposing individuals to a spectrum of disorders, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and allergic asthma. Evidence linking psychological stress to atopy expression has grown with our increased understanding of the natural history and pathophysiology of atopic disorders and the neurobiology of stress. However, the specific pathways involved remain to be elucidated in human studies. Findings suggest that stressors may influence pathogenesis by causing dysregulated biobehavioral states (e.g., depression, PTSD), which exert effects on physiological processes that influence disease risk. Extreme forms of stress exposure (multiple stressors within the same time period, chronic stressors over developmental periods, traumatic events) are more likely to lead to persistent psychological and physiological alterations. Disturbed regulation of endocrine and autonomic systems (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, sympathetic-adrenal-medullary system) may modulate offspring immune functioning beginning in utero. Therefore, understanding maternal dysregulation of these systems in pregnancy may be particularly informative. Non-optimal early caregiving experiences (e.g., maternal psychopathology, maternal insensitivity) may also impact these processes by leading to disrupted infant emotion regulation and neuroimmune development, setting the stage for altered reactivity to stimuli and inflammatory processes, hallmarks of early atopy. Exploring these links may be particularly relevant in urban populations, who are disproportionately burdened by both stress and chronic atopic disorders. We will examine the effects of maternal stress (cumulative perinatal stress, lifetime trauma), on the expression of child atopy in an urban sample (N=275). We will incorporate strategies for studying stress reactivity during pregnancy, infancy, and early childhood to elucidate pathways from stress to a hierarchy of early intermediate phenotypes that may be related to persistent atopic disorders (early sensitization as indexed by IgE expression and skin test reactivity, T-helper cell differentiation, airway resistance, early clinical phenotypes). We will examine how intervening processes may affect these relationships, including how maternal-fetal endocrine indicators of stress (prenatal cortisol, corticotrophin-releasing hormone), pre/postnatal maternal psychological functioning, and postnatal caregiving behaviors impact the infant stress response (cortisol, respiration, sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic functioning), assessed during a standardized laboratory protocol at age 6 months, and child atopic profiles assessed through 30 months. In this prospective design, we will examine how fetal stress exposure may influence early neuroimmune development and how such effects are independent of or moderated by postnatal factors. We will test the contributions of proximal and lifetime stress exposures on the proposed pathways. The study findings may identify mechanisms that lead to and maintain early predisposition to costly pediatric atopic disorders, informing more efficacious prevention and intervention strategies.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study may increase our understanding of the effects of perinatal maternal stress on vulnerability to early intermediate phenotypes that may predispose to subsequent risk for developing atopic disorders in childhood. Such knowledge may inform efforts to design programs to prevent the development of atopic disorders, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis and eczema, particularly in high-risk urban populations. Given the enormous cost in the management of atopic patients in the United States, understanding the earliest stages of development offers significant potential benefits to society.

"Integrative Stress Reduction for Maternal-Child Health The purpose of the proposed Mentored Research Scientist Career Development Award is to promote the  candidate's development as an independent clinical trial researcher in mind-body medicine with a focus on  reducing disparities in maternal-child health. Rates of preterm birth and low birth weight are increasing and  are persistently higher among vulnerable U.S. populations. Animal and human models consistently implicate  maternal stress as a significant risk factor in the etiology of adverse birth outcomes. Maladaptive patterns in  hormonal and cardiovascular aspects of the stress response appear to be linked with preterm birth and low  birth weight. In addition, psychological stress and poor coping may drive physiological stress responses that  lead to adverse birth outcomes. Dr. Duncan's research, using the framework of revised Stress and Coping  Theory (Folkman, 1997), has shown that pregnant women who learn mind-body practices during pregnancy  report healthy improvements in levels of perceived stress, pregnancy anxiety, mindfulness, positive and  negative affect, and depression in the perinatal period. The candidate seeks additional training in the design  and conduct of randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of mind-body interventions and understanding of  physiological and psychological mechanisms underlying the stress response during pregnancy. The  University of California, San Francisco is an ideal environment for the proposed training because it provides  access to experts in RCT methodology, integrative medicine, and the basic sciences of psychological and  physiological aspects of the stress response, including the physiology of human pregnancy. The training  plan includes formal coursework, informal tutorials with experts in their respective fields, and supervision of  Dr. Duncan's leadership as PI on an RCT assessing the efficacy of a mind-body enhanced version of an  existing, culturally-sensitive, group-based model of prenatal healthcare delivery. Rigorous testing of  hypotheses regarding the impact of the mind-body practices will occur by comparing the effects of the mindbody  enhanced program with the standard program. Effects of each intervention on psychological stress and  coping mechanisms, stress physiology (neuroendocrine and cardiovascular/ autonomic nervous system  function), and birth outcomes (gestational age and birth weight) will be compared. The results of the study  will provide initial information about whether a mind-body intervention targeted to reduce stress during the  perinatal period through mindfulness may provide clinical benefit for improving birth outcomes, thus  informing development of an R01 proposal and advancing the long term goal of reducing health disparities. Maternal stress is consistently linked with preterm birth and low birth weight. The integrative stress reduction  intervention being tested targets psychological stress and coping, stress hormones, and cardiovascular  stress reactivity through mindfulness practices. If the enhanced intervention is effective, it will help to  address a key public health problem and may help reduce health disparities in maternal-child health.",Integrative Stress Reduction for

"Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Black Americans carry a disproportionate burden of social risk factors for poor mental health, such as living in violent urban environments and experiencing economic deprivation and discrimination. Despite these risks, Black Americans have lower lifetime prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders than Whites. The reasons for Black Americans' resilience to these mental health disorders are unknown. This proposal aims to examine cumulative adversity and subsequent diminished neurobiological stress response as a possible explanation of Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and depression. It also aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this resilience. These aims will be accomplished by conducting research interviews with 1,306 young adults (age 20-21; 60% Black, 40% White; 50% female) from an existing community sample who have been previously assessed three times during childhood and adolescence. These research interviews will provide information on adversity experienced by the participants, categorical diagnoses and dimensional measures of internalizing distress, and physiological indicators of reactivity to stress. Neural bases of stress response will be evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for a subset of 120 Black and 120 White participants from the larger study. This study is innovative because it proposes to test a novel mechanism explaining the resilience of Black Americans to depression and anxiety, incorporates both categorical and dimensional measures of internalizing problems, and examines the role of physiological stress response and regulatory neural circuit in the resilience process. The results will have important implications for our understanding of racial disparities i anxiety and depression, neurobiological mechanisms underlying resilience to stress, and relationships between environmental stress, neural and physiological response, and negative affect. These findings will point to novel ways to diagnose and treat mental health problems in Black and White Americans.          Black Americans are exposed to more adversity than White Americans, yet they experience lower rates of anxiety and depressive disorders. The proposed project investigates cumulative adversity and diminished neurobiological stress response as causal mechanisms underlying Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and mood disorders. The findings will improve our understanding of the role of adversity and neurobiological stress system in anxiety and depression and suggest novel approaches to diagnose and treat these mental health problems in Black and White Americans.

"Setting the trajectory     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To identify at-risk children precise indicators of the biological changes associated with early life adversity, including prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and racial disparities are needed. Without reliable indicators capable of providing mechanistic insight the ability to design and implement innovative interventions, and alter negative developmental trajectories, remains limited. Alterations in the stress response system, determined by salivary cortisol levels, are associated with PNMS. Disrupted parent-child attachment, as well as the therapeutic repair of this relationship, has also been found to influence the cortisol response in infants. However, the stress hypo-responsive period in early childhood may limit the utility of cortisol as a stand-alone indicator during this critical developmental time point. Additionally, while cortisol indicates dysregulation in the HPA axis it provides minimal mechanistic information. The established role of genetic and epigenetic factors, including FKBP5 and miRNAs, to both the responsiveness and adaptation of the HPA axis suggest they play an important role in the underlying mechanism. Concurrent measurement of gene expression, miRNA, and cortisol is expected to more robustly define how early adversity is biological embedded. Saliva represents an ideal accessible biological source that reflects an individual's complex internal milieu. Recent evidence indicates that mRNA, miRNA and telomere length can be reliably measured in saliva. Studies have also demonstrated changes in each of these markers with exposure to early adversity and stress. These collective findings indicate that an epigenetic psychophysiological profile concurrently measuring each component is feasible and a critical next step in research seeking to chart the trajectory of mental illness and define the earliest intervention time points. This study expects to enroll infants of African American women with extensive characterization of PNMS and maternal preconception adversity. Saliva will be collected pre and post a known stressor designed to activate the HPA axis at two early developmental time points. Infants will be stressed before (4 months, using the Still Face Procedure) and after (12 months, using the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP)) the development of attachment. The cortisol response to the stressor, fold change in FKBP5 mRNA pre/post the stressor as well as initial levels of miR-134 and miR-16 and telomere length will be determined. Leveraging the increased statistical power associated with propensity score matching this proposal will test the association between PNMS, attachment and salivary markers while controlling for preconception adversity. Achievement of the proposal aims of this proposal is expected to provide enhanced biological evidence in support of the implementation of attachment based interventions early in the life course. The critical need to more effectively address persistent health disparities and decrease the negative health outcomes associated with toxic stress requires the development of innovative methodologies that both define biological mechanisms and track the effectiveness of interventions at the behavioral, physiologic, and molecular level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because an enhanced mechanistic understanding of the biological embedding of early adversity is ultimately expected to lead to novel interventions and preventive efforts that alter the life-long negative health trajectories associated with toxic stress and health disparities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIMH's mission that pertains to strengthening the public health impact of NIMH funded research and to charting mental illness trajectories to determine when to intervene.",Setting the trajectory,8902631,R01MH101533,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Motion ', ' premRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' FKBP Rotamase ', ' FKBP ', ' FK506 Binding Proteins ', ' FK-506-Binding Protein ', ' Tacrolimus Binding Proteins ', ' telomere ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Salivary ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' hypothalamic pituitary axis ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ', ' DSM ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Age-Months ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Security ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NIMH,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2014,101920,0.09445314857044411
"Psychobiology of Racial Minority Stress and Cellular Aging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Dr. H. David Chae, Sc.D., M.A., is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Behavioral Sciences and Health Education at the Rollins School of Public Health, Emory University. He has an established history of conducting research on social and psychological determinants of health in racial minority populations. He has consistently applied his expertise and diverse academic training, in psychology, sociology, and public health, to examine factors associated with racial minority status and health. More specifically, his research has focused on racial discrimination and dimensions of racial identity i relation to mental health, health behaviors, as well as physical disease outcomes associated with aging among racial minority populations.  The scope of Dr. Chae's work on psychosocial factors associated with racial minority health would be considerably enriched through additional training aimed at gaining a broad foundation of knowledge on psychobiological stress pathways, and more in-depth knowledge on telomere maintenance and function. Acquiring this solid background would allow him to conduct epidemiologic studies integrating biomarkers of inflammation and endocrine stress markers, in addition to research examining leukocyte telomere length (LTL), a novel marker of cumulative life stress and systemic aging at the physiologic level. Examining LTL may be particularly informative in studying the impact of racial minority stress which is experienced across the life- course. These activities are complemented by additional training in advanced biostatistical modeling (latent variable analysis), which add to his existing skills in the use of traditional epidemiologic methods. Latent class/profile analysis (LCA/LPA) will be used to empirically derive groups of participants distinguished along physiologic indicators of stress, and explicitly applies the knowledge gained in psychobiological stress mechanisms. Structural equation modeling (SEM) will be used to model hypothesized pathways linking racial discrimination and LTL. Additional career development activities emphasized in this application include training in the responsible conduct of research and continued professional development, through presentations at scientific conferences, the publication of manuscripts, and the development and submission of an R01 application that builds upon the knowledge that he gains, as well as findings from the proposed research. These activities are facilitated through a combination of mentorship by experts, didactic coursework, workshops, attendance of scientific conferences, and a directed program of reading. The training and development plan includes introductory courses in aging, stress biology, psychoneuroimmunology, and behavioral endocrinology; workshops and conferences specifically relevant to psychobiological pathways associated with aging and telomere maintenance and function; courses and workshops on latent variable analysis and statistical programming; as well as those focused on research ethics and grant writing. Integrating this substantive and methodological knowledge into his existing work represents an important step towards developing a trans- disciplinary research portfolio that spans the social and basic sciences; and his career goal to lead collaborative, multi-disciplinary teams including those with expertise in diverse fields, including epidemiology, sociology, psychology, neuroscience, and molecular biology in studying racial disparities in aging.  Each of the training and development activities included in this application are applied towards the research plan, which involves examining data from three studies - the Heart and Soul Study (HSS); the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA); and the Bay Area Heart Health Study (BAHHS). Analysis of these three datasets is aimed at: (1) identifying inflammatory markers and endocrine markers of stress that cluster with LTL and subsequently predict aging-related health outcomes, thereby providing evidence for biological mechanisms impacting LTL and disease processes; (2) examining whether racial discrimination is associated with LTL, and identifying psychological and biological factors that may be on the pathway linking this exposure and outcome; and (3) exploring other psychosocial factors associated with racial minority status, such as affective and cognitive responses to racial discrimination, coping, racial identity, in-group racial bias, and racial socialization, which may also impact LTL and aging-related disease outcomes. Each aspect of the training component of this application is applied in innovative ways to the research plan; and together they represent a holistic approach to studying factors and pathways associated with aging-related disease outcomes. Emory University serves as an ideal base to achieve the career development and research objectives outlined in this application, given its history of excellence in both the social and biological sciences, and emphasis on inter-disciplinary educational programs. Emory University commits substantial institutional investment, including financial and intellectual resources to ensure the success of this application and progress towards becoming an independent investigator. A specific objective of this application is to submit an R01 grant focused on identifying risk factors associated with LTL among racial minority groups, by applying the broad knowledge on the psychobiology of aging and training in the collection, analysis, and interpretation of LTL data; and the research findings obtained from this application. Through this award, Dr. Chae will be well- positioned to achieve his goal of developing a research agenda that bridges social epidemiology, psychology, and biology in understanding racial disparities in aging-related diseases.           Studies consistently indicate that African American men experience premature declines in health and have higher rates of early mortality compared to other racial and gender groups, and that these disparities can in part be explained by the disproportionate experience of psychosocial stressors, including experiences of racial discrimination. However, there are gaps in knowledge on the biological mechanisms engaged in the stress response which can help to understand how psychosocial stressors are physiologically embedded and generate racial disparities in health. This application is relevant to the science of how race-specific social stressors accelerate physiologic deterioration at the biological level, measured using leukocyte telomere length, a novel marker of cumulative life stress; and contributes to understanding the sources of racial disparities in aging-related disease outcomes.

"Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child Biology and Behavior     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable evidence documenting the effects of prenatal maternal stress and emotions on birth and early child outcomes, the biological pathways by which maternal stress is transferred to children are not yet well understood. The proposed study will test a set of novel hypotheses about maternal stress and allostatic load (physiological dysregulation across multiple systems due to cumulative wear-and-tear associated with chronic and acute stress exposure) during the preconception and prenatal periods. The study focuses primarily on HPA axis regulatory mechanisms in a sample of 201 diverse mother-child pairs, particularly the prediction of child neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress regulation at ages 2 and 3 and cellular aging (indexed by telomere length) in both young children and their mothers. Our inclusion of the preconception period is innovative and yields a more comprehensive understanding of developmental origins (including fetal programming) of later health and developmental competence. One overall objective is to identify modifiable risk factors that can be targeted for early effective prevention of adverse health, neurocognitive, and behavioral outcomes throughout the lifespan.  Participants will be recruited from an enrolled cohort of ethnically diverse, mostly low-income women in Washington, DC and Lake County, IL near Chicago as part of a large multi-site NIH collaborative study (Child Community Health Network Study; CCHN). The parent study includes extensive interview measures of maternal stress in preconception and pregnancy and maternal biomarkers that pose risk for disease in the next generation, creating a unique opportunity to examine prospective predictors of child outcomes. The specific aims are to examine effects of maternal stress and allostatic load, especially HPA regulation during preconception and in pregnancy on outcomes at ages 2 and 3. The outcomes are: (1) children's cortisol responses to acute laboratory stressors and circadian regulation of cortisol production; (2) children's fearful or anxious temperament measured by innovative observational laboratory testing; (3) children's neurocognitive functioning using standardized assessments; (4) children's leukocyte telomere length at age 2 and rates of shortening from ages 2 to 3. We will also examine leukocyte telomere length of mothers as a function of stress and test for mother-child associations.  RELEVANCE: This study addresses an NICHD research priority in 2011 to identify developmental origins of susceptibility to later health, disease, and longevity. Results will provide the first evidence about plausible biological pathways prior to pregnancy that, in turn, program prenatal and postnatal development, taking into consideration many other known environmental and biological influences. The findings have the potential to yield new understanding about the pervasive, serious maternal and child health disparities that extend throughout the lifespan and disproportionately impact low income, minority populations.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adult diseases with developmental origins including neurocognitive disorders are estimated to take an immense toll on our nation's health. The proposed research will prospectively investigate whether maternal factors in the preconception period and in pregnancy, especially stress and HPA regulatory mechanisms, alter the behavioral, stress regulatory and neurocognitive outcomes of young children, as well as effects on cellular aging processes in mother-child pairs. Findings will provide a new foundation for developing potentially powerful preventive interventions to improve children's lifelong well-being.",Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child Biology and Behavior,8720804,R01HD072021,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Physiology of Coping in Rural Low-income Preadolescents: An Experimental Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical and mental health disparities stemming from socioeconomic inequality and poverty are well documented (Evans, Wolf & Adler, 2012). There is clear evidence that (a) the groundwork for lifelong disease and premature death is laid during childhood (e.g., Chen & Miller, 2012), and (b) damage to and deregulation of the physiologic stress response is one of the most powerful mechanisms of the effects of poverty and economic inequality on illness and disease (e.g., Evans & Kim, 2012). To contribute solutions to health disparities, we need interventions that affect the physiologic systems that confer the risk. Since the stress response systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis/HPA and sympathetic-adrenomedullary/SAM) are a central mechanism for SES-based disparities, these are critical systems to target. Improving children's ability to cope with stress and regulate their reactivity has the potential to break the cycle of damage, but only if the coping strategies and regulatory processes that we target have effects at the physiologic level-we have preliminary findings suggesting that they do. The proposed project seeks to firmly establish this connection.  Preadolescence is a crucial time during which children's ability to recognize stress and its causes matures, and repertoires for coping with stress grow in both size and complexity. Preadolescents are, therefore, at a ripe stage to both inform our basic science questions and benefit from future coping-based prevention. Our team has compiled a basic understanding of the efficacious and inefficacious forms of coping used by children and adolescents exposed to poverty-related stress (e.g., Santiago, Wadsworth et al., 2011; Wadsworth & Compas, 2002; Wadsworth & Santiago, 2008, 2009), and we have discovered that living with poverty-related stress constrains the development of and/or ability to utilize efficacious coping (Santiago, Etter et al., 2011; Wadsworth et al., 2011). We do not yet know whether coping that is efficacious at the behavioral level has concomitant effects on the underlying physiologic stress response systems in poor, rural preadolescents. The current project will use an experimental approach and data from multiple levels of analysis, including measures of both HPA and SAM activity, observational coding of in vivo coping, and experimental manipulation of coping to: (a) compare the physiologic downregulation of randomly assigned in vivo efficacious (secondary control) and ineffective (disengagement) coping in low-income preadolescents, (b) examine how preadolescents' typical strategies for coping moderate their ability to either make use of secondary control strategies or to regulate themselves despite being primed for avoidance, (c) identify subgroups of preadolescents with different reactivity and regulation profiles, and (d) examine the individual and family characteristics of the identified subgroups, including who is more and less successful in each condition-potentially identifying person-specific intervention targets. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system can offer new directions for combatting health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic-based disparities in physical and mental health problems are large, persistent, and severe; begin during childhood; and stem from damage to physiologic stress response systems caused by chronic stress. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system may offer new directions for combatting health disparities. This project will use an experimental approach to examine the ability of different types of coping to have direct effects on low-income preadolescents' physiologic stress responses systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic-adrenomedullary system).            ",Physiology of Coping in Rural Low-income Preadolescents: An Experimental Approach,8770733,R21HD078753,"['Affect ', ' α-amylase ', ' glycogenase ', ' alpha-1,4-D-Glucanglucanohydrolase ', ' 1,4-alpha-D-Glucan glucanohydrolase ', ' alpha-amylase ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cues ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Solutions ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Inequality ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Reliance ', ' Wolves ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' meetings ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' preteen ', ' preadolescence ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' distraction ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Population Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Instruction ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' Trier Social Stress Test ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R21,2014,216235,0.13815084107976539
"Social Determinants of Inflammation and Metabolic Syndrom among African Americans  PROJECT SUMMARY  In recent years, strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation (INF) and metabolic syndrome (MS) represent dysregulated biological systems that predict onset of chronic, age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and dementia. Although a wealth of findings has indicated that psychosocial stress is a major determinant of INF and MS, a number of crucial questions remain unanswered. First, we do not know whether sensitive period (early biological programming), stress accumulation, social schematic, or mismatch models best account for the development of INF and MS. Second, we have little information regarding the range of stressors within a developmental period that are most critical. Studies of childhood stress usually simply assess low SES or exposure to harsh parenting, and these measurements typically entail retrospective reports. Research on the effect of adult stress sometimes includes community context but usually fails to consider the way that childhood stress may moderate reactions to adult stressors. And, whether the focus is childhood or adult adversity, there has been limited consideration of the way that race-related stressors such as segregation, perceived racism, discrimination, and internalized racism impact biological dysregulation. Third, we know little about the extent to which factors such as parental support, racial socialization, social support, or religiosity operate to reduce the deleterious impact of childhood, adolescent, or adult stressors on INF and MS. A final limitation of past research is that it has focused, with a few exceptions, on White samples whereas African Americans display significantly higher rates of almost every type of chronic illness and score higher on biomarkers of INF and most indictors of MS. In order to address these unanswered questions and limitations, this proposal seeks funding to add biomarkers of INF and MS, as well as telephone interview data regarding stress and health behaviors, to the 18 years of longitudinal data that has been collected on the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS) sample of roughly 700 African Americans (now 28 years of age). Specifically, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) identify the cluster of SES- and race-related stressors experienced in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood that best predict adult INF and MS. 2) Use these stress indices to test competing models regarding the manner in which stressors from various developmental periods combine to influence biological dysregulaton. And, 3) investigate the extent to which the experience of supportive parenting and racial socialization during childhood, and/or supportive relationships and religiosity during adulthood, are moderating factors that promote healthy biomarkers for INF and MS. There are few, if any, efficacious preventive interventions that address the causes of health disparities. The Institute of Medicine prescribes that such efforts be based on the results of longitudinal, epidemiological research with target populations. Currently, there are no prospective investigations that identify the protective factors that interrupt the translation of social determinants of stress into biological vulnerabilities for African Americans. The results of the proposed research will identify protective processes and serve as the basis for empirically-based, health disparities preventive interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving the quality of longer lives requires information regarding the causes of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and dementia. In recent years, strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation and metabolic syndrome represent dysregulated biological systems that predict onset of these illnesses. The present study tests competing models regarding the manner in which stress and protective factors combine to influence the development of inflammation and metabolic syndrome.            ",Social Determinants of Inflammation and Metabolic Syndrom among African Americans,8621298,R01HL118045,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Inflammatory Arthritis ', ' Atrophic Arthritis ', ' Rheumatoid Arthritis ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Charge ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Health behavior ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Socialization ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Translations ', ' Weather ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Reaction ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' peer ', ' vigilance ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biological systems ', ' community health study ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2014,617897,0.13477847665191892
"Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity  Abstract The growing racial disparity in obesity has reached a critical juncture, particularly among black and white females. Obesity is now being perpetuated across generations. While there is uncertainty about how best to prevent obesity and the related racial disparities, converging lines of evidence support the influence of stress on obesity. We hypothesize that income and race are associated with higher levels of both objective and perceived stress, which in turn are associated with higher rates of dysregulated eating, a behavior posited to result in an increased rate of obesity. Finally, we propose that stress has a direct effect on the level of obesity in the offspring. We propose to model these relationships longitudinally using the National Growth and Healthy Study (NGHS) that enrolled equal numbers of black and white girls and that contains extensive measures of life stress, nonhomeostatic eating, household demographic and socioeconomic indicators and cardiometabolic risk factors for black and white girls initially sampled at age 10 and interviewed annually until age 20. We will extend these data, adding a new wave of data collection for the women who are now 36 and their children. We will interview participants regarding their current levels of stress, household food insecurity, dysregulated eating behaviors such as dietary restraint and overeating, and collect data on dietary intake and physical activity. We will collect measured weight and central adiposity and clinical measures of metabolic syndrome on both the women and their children. Building on the rich source of longitudinal data that NGHS provides, we will model relationships between these factors and weight status from early childhood to adulthood among these women and their children in order to examine the effects of cumulative stress, eating behaviors and obesity on obesity in the next generation. The study aims to test the hypotheses that: 1) stress and dysregulated eating results in an increased rate of obesity, exacerbated by food insecurity; 2) maternal stress and dysregulated eating have a direct effect on the level of obesity and markers of metabolic syndrome in offspring; and, 3) race and income are associated with higher levels of stress and dysregulated eating in women. Our preliminary data suggests that stress leads to excessive weight gain ten years later in the NGHS cohort. We will identify predictors of weight gain trajectories from childhood to adulthood. These constructs have the potential to lead to promising interventions coupled with traditional diet and physical activity components that will help girls and women throughout the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing black/white disparities and the perpetuation of obesity across generations has reached a critical juncture, particularly among girls and women. The current proposal seeks to add a new wave of data collection to survey participants regarding current stress factors, household food insecurity, and non-homeostatic eating such as restrained and drive to overeat and evaluate the relationships between these factors and weight gain trajectories in a longitudinal cohort of girls followed from age 10 to 36 years. We believe that this approach will identify modifiable stress-based factors that can be incorporated into intervention trials leading to sustained changes in children's and women's weight trajectories.                ","Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity",8630959,R01HD073568,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Data Collection ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fat Body ', ' Female ', ' Food ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mothers ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Weights and Measures ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' Body Measures ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Body fat ', ' Life ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Source ', ' waist circumference ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' Coupled ', ' sixteen year old ', ' age 16 years ', ' 16 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 year old ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2014,550043,0.05539573757994502

"Interaction of Air Pollution and Psychosocial Stress on Cardiovascular Disease.  7. Project Summary/Abstract This proposal seeks to understand the interaction between air pollution and psychosocial stress on markers of inflammation and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). Under the mentorship of Dr. Joel Kaufman, this training and research plan will build upon Dr. Hajat's expertise in social epidemiology and prepare her for a career studying the nexus of social and environmental factors and their impact on CVD. During the K99 phase, Dr. Hajat will use didactic instruction and independent study to gain additional training in 1) the biology of stress and CVD 2) spatial statistical methods and 3) exposure generation and assessment. This training will provide Dr. Hajat with interdisciplinary skills and knowledge as she moves towards an independent research career. During the K99 phase Dr. Hajat will characterize the extent to which biomarkers of stress, neighborhood-level psychosocial stressors and individual level psychosocial stressors are spatially correlated with ambient air pollutants, specifically particulate matter <2.5 ¿m in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and black carbon. This work will build upon Dr. Hajat's previous work using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a longitudinal study of subclinical CVD in a cohort of older adults recruited from six metropolitan areas across the US. Upon completion of the training phase of this award, Dr. Hajat will undertake research during the R00 phase of the project that will transition her to an independent investigator. The aims of this research are (1) to assess the synergistic effects of air pollution and psychosocial stress (measured objectively and subjectively) on markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen) as well as on the progression of atherosclerosis in different vascular beds, measured by intima media thickness, coronary calcification and ankle brachial index and (2) to conduct a crossover study which exposes participants to both diesel exhaust (DE) from an inhalation facility and a laboratory-based mental stress test to assess the synergistic effect of both exposures on physiological outcomes such as blood pressure, heart rate variability, catecholamine levels and IL-6. The research in the R00 phase proposes epidemiologic studies of two complementary extant data sources, MESA and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional nationally representative sample of the US population. Both studies have data on air pollution, psychosocial stressors, inflammation and subclinical CVD and together capture a larger geographic area and populations across the life course. The R00 phase also proposes conducting an experimental study. The study will be conducted in one of the nation's few controlled inhalation facilities where subjects will be exposed to both DE and a laboratory generated acute mental stressor. The acute mental stress exposure, which is often used in psychology, will consist of administering a speech task and an arithmetic task. Understanding the synergistic effects of air pollution and psychosocial stress will help advance our understanding of the biological mechanisms behind environmental health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in rates of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the US, have been persistent for decades. New approaches to understanding the root causes of health disparities are needed if our nation wants to make progress towards alleviating these disparities and in so doing improving the public's health. This proposal will explore the joint effect of psychosocial stressors and an environmental hazard, air pollution, to better understand if together these factors contribute to precursors of cardiovascular disease.                ",Interaction of Air Pollution and Psychosocial Stress on Cardiovascular Disease.,8616947,K99ES023498,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', '

"Sex Differences in Stress Receptors Underlie Female Vulnerability to Stress   Stress-related psychiatric disorders, like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, are debilitating mental illnesses that affect twice as many women as men. Although the etiology of this disparity remains unknown, it is thought to be due to sex differences in stress responses. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) orchestrates stress responses, in part, by regulating norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transmission, and CRF is dysregulated in stress-related disorders. The goal of my current research is to identify sex differences in a receptor for CRF (CRF1 subtype) that may account for sex differences in stress responsivity. To date, I found that CRF1 signals and is trafficked differently in female rats in a manner that can account for elevated responses to acute stress and decreased adaptation to chronic stress. In females, CRF1 immunoprecipitation revealed a greater coupling to Gs, the GTP-binding protein that mediates most cellular responses. Additionally, stress-induced CRF1 association with ¿-arrestin2, an integral step in receptor internalization, was apparent in males but not females. Immunoelectron microscopy confirmed stress-induced CRF1 internalization in male rats only, suggesting that this adaptive process to compensate for large amounts of CRF, as may be released in depression, is compromised in females. Importantly, sex differences in CRF1 function rendered NE neurons in the locus coeruleus of female rats more sensitive to low levels of CRF and less adaptable to high levels of CRF. However, because this is the first report of sex differences in stress- related neuropeptide receptor, many questions remain unanswered. Aim 1 of this proposal, which will be completed during the mentored phase (K99), investigates why CRF1 binds proteins differently in males vs. females. There are no sex differences in CRF1 structure, so I will learn proteomic approaches to identify whether sex differences in post-translational modifications of CRF1 account for these effects. Aims 2 and 3 will be completed during the independent phase. Aim 2 will identify the hormones that contribute to the sex difference in CRF1. To this end, I will combine previously acquired endocrine techniques with the skills learned during the K99 phase to determine whether ovarian or testicular hormones establish the sex differences. Aim 3 will evaluate whether sex differences extend to the other receptor subtype, CRF2, in the dorsal raphe nucleus. Because CRF1 and CRF2 share a high degree of sequence identity, proteomic approaches are expected to reveal sex differences in the CRF2. CRF2 activation of the dorsal raphe-5-HT system promotes a passive behavioral response strategy to stress that is a risk factor for depression. Thus, sex differences in CRF2 may contribute to the increased vulnerability of females this disorder. By addressing these questions, this proposal will help elucidate the etiology of sex differences in stress-related disorders. Moreover, because CRF antagonists are being developed to treat these illnesses, considering sex differences in CRF receptors may increase the efficacy of these compounds in women.  Women are twice as likely as men to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, however the biological basis of this sex difference remains unknown. The proposed research will identify molecular and hormonal changes that increase the function of a critical stress-related neuropeptide in female rats. This project will not only help us understand why women are more vulnerable to stress-related mental illnesses, but it will identify new pharmaceutical targets which can lead to treatments that are efficacious in both men and women.",Sex Differences in Stress Receptors Underlie Female Vulnerability to Stress,8720818,R00MH092438,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human

"Identity Stress and Health in Three Cohorts of LGB individuals     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth and adults suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Minority stress theory suggests that because of prejudice and stigma in the social environment, LGB people experience excess stress that leads to poor health outcomes and health disparities. Because of its focus on the social environment, minority stress theory leads us to predict that the character of stress processes affecting LGBs shift along with improvement in the social environment. Similarly shifting are notions of LGB identity, connection with the community, and the types of social and health services LGB people seek. If we are to achieve the U.S. Public Health Services' goal of reducing health disparities related to sexual orientation, we need to understand the impact of changes in identity and minority stress on LGB health and, using this knowledge, inform public health interventions across the lifespan. To gain this knowledge, we propose a longitudinal study using a probability sample of diverse LGBs representative of LGBs in the U.S. population. We seek to compare 3 cohorts of LGB individuals-aged 18 - 25, 34 - 42, and 48 - 55 years old-who are distinct in that they were exposed to significantly different social environments when they came of age. We are interested in ways that identity and minority stress predict health across the cohorts. We will use a mixed method design that allows us to gain knowledge from both qualitative and survey data. We use an innovative 2-stage procedure to recruit a sample of 676 LGB individuals representative of U.S. Black, Latino, and White LGB populations. We assess respondents baseline and annually for 3 years thereafter. In a qualitative study, we use a narrative life history to assess a diverse group of Black, Latino, White, and Asian LGB individuals in urban and rural regions of New York, California, and Arizona. We hypothesize that: 1. Despite readily acknowledging an LGB identity and coming out at a younger age than did older cohorts, the younger cohorts differ from older cohorts in that their LGB identity is less central, they are less strongly identified with the LGB community, and have different meanings of sexual orientation and identity. 2. Compared with older, the younger cohort experience less minority stress related to their own acceptance of a gay identity and coming out, but more external stress, including prejudice-related stressful life events, antigay violence, and everyday forms of discrimination. 3. Members of younger LGB cohorts utilize fewer LGB-identified social and health services than do members of older LGB cohorts. 4. In structural equations, the minority stress model functions equally well in predicting health outcomes in the younger and older cohorts, but patterns of stress, resilience, and health outcomes differ among the cohorts in accordance with findings in Aims 1 and 2.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth continue to suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers.

"Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now large-scale epidemiological evidence that aspects of chronic psychological stress, such as early adversity or job strain, and early life stress, predict earlier disease onset and mortality. Despite documentation of the importance of stress to health, there are several critical barriers that prevent progress in the epidemiological study of stress as a risk factor for disease. Measurement of stress is inherently complex and multi-level (e.g., social, psychological, physiological). There are few agreed upon 'gold standard' measures of stress, hence measurement is often inconsistent and superficial where heterogeneous constructs are conflated. There is also little understanding of the conditions under which stress exposure can promote vulnerability vs. resiliency to disease. Meanwhile, there have been rapid advances in the basic science of stress processes, which have helped to unpack the cognitive and affective components, links to brain and peripheral physiological responses, and richer measures of daily stress - e.g., through ecological momentary assessments using technology to obtain detailed profiles of exposures and contexts. Thus, epidemiological stress science can benefit from a more coherent multilevel model that encompasses better measurement of lifespan exposures and responses, including the social, psychological, and physiological indices of stress that have the greatest impact on health. The proposed R24 will recruit excellent scientists with relevant methods to apply their interests to th advancement of stress measurement across human development, with a focus on how lifespan stress affects health in mid to late life. Aims include: 1) Development of a stress measurement taxonomy, including guidelines for best measurement; 2) Development of a 'toolbox' of short measures of stress that can be used in epidemiological studies of adult aging internationally. These will be drawn from innovative measurement from basic experimental and field research, refinement/shortening of existing measures, and results from comparative validation of promising measures; and 3) Promotion of stress research in epidemiological studies of aging, both through harmonizing existing measures and adding new toolbox measures. This in turn will lead to discoveries that refine the taxonomy and research methodologies. Improved stress measurement offers tremendous opportunities for advancing the field of basic research, enhancing the efficacy of health-promotion interventions and policy.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic stress can impair health, but the mechanisms are not well known and the measures that investigators use are diverse and inconsistent. This network will promote better theory and new measures, and develop a ""stress measurement toolbox,"" that large-scale studies can use. This in turn will lead to a deeper understanding of how stress affects psychological well-being as well as disease etiology and progression, and ways to intervene.            ",Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging,8756441,R24AG048024,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Comparative Study ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' indexing ', ' Internships ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Paper ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' field study ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' validation studies ', ' Impaired health ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Skin ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' comparative ', ' critical period ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' standard measure ', ' population health ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R24,2014,291295,0.19376095167337348
"Setting a trajectory: biological markers of early stress and child development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To identify at-risk children precise indicators of the biological changes associated with early life adversity, including prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and racial disparities are needed. Without reliable indicators capable of providing mechanistic insight the ability to design and implement innovative interventions, and alter negative developmental trajectories, remains limited. Alterations in the stress response system, determined by salivary cortisol levels, are associated with PNMS. Disrupted parent-child attachment, as well as the therapeutic repair of this relationship, has also been found to influence the cortisol response in infants. However, the stress hypo-responsive period in early childhood may limit the utility of cortisol as a stand-alone indicator during this critical developmental time point. Additionally, while cortisol indicates dysregulation in the HPA axis it provides minimal mechanistic information. The established role of genetic and epigenetic factors, including FKBP5 and miRNAs, to both the responsiveness and adaptation of the HPA axis suggest they play an important role in the underlying mechanism. Concurrent measurement of gene expression, miRNA, and cortisol is expected to more robustly define how early adversity is biological embedded. Saliva represents an ideal accessible biological source that reflects an individual's complex internal milieu. Recent evidence indicates that mRNA, miRNA and telomere length can be reliably measured in saliva. Studies have also demonstrated changes in each of these markers with exposure to early adversity and stress. These collective findings indicate that an epigenetic psychophysiological profile concurrently measuring each component is feasible and a critical next step in research seeking to chart the trajectory of mental illness and define the earliest intervention time points. This study expects to enroll infants of African American women with extensive characterization of PNMS and maternal preconception adversity. Saliva will be collected pre and post a known stressor designed to activate the HPA axis at two early developmental time points. Infants will be stressed before (4 months, using the Still Face Procedure) and after (12 months, using the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP)) the development of attachment. The cortisol response to the stressor, fold change in FKBP5 mRNA pre/post the stressor as well as initial levels of miR-134 and miR-16 and telomere length will be determined. Leveraging the increased statistical power associated with propensity score matching this proposal will test the association between PNMS, attachment and salivary markers while controlling for preconception adversity. Achievement of the proposal aims of this proposal is expected to provide enhanced biological evidence in support of the implementation of attachment based interventions early in the life course. The critical need to more effectively address persistent health disparities and decrease the negative health outcomes associated with toxic stress requires the development of innovative methodologies that both define biological mechanisms and track the effectiveness of interventions at the behavioral, physiologic, and molecular level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because an enhanced mechanistic understanding of the biological embedding of early adversity is ultimately expected to lead to novel interventions and preventive efforts that alter the life-long negative health trajectories associated with toxic stress and health disparities.

"Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women are disproportionately affected by systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and also face worse consequences of disease activity. This proposed study is important to helping improve our understanding of how psychosocial stressors that are salient in the lives of African American women, and in particular experiences of racial discrimination, exacerbate SLE severity and progression.

"Stress & Parenting in Blacks: Preventing Obesity in Youth to Reduce Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity was a factor in over 16,000 cancer-related deaths in African-Americans (Blacks) in 2011. Blacks have the highest prevalence of obesity and cancer death rates of any group in the United States. Obesity and lifestyle behaviors related to increased cancer risks are often established during childhood, highlighting the importance of parenting behaviors in reducing obesity-related cancer risks. The proposed study examines the influence of coping in mitigating the effects of stress on caregiver behaviors that promote child obesity, fast food, fruit and vegetable consumption, activity and inactivity. The long term research objective is to develop an intervention for Black families to reduce obesity-related cancer risk in children. Stress, defined as the negative psychological response to events that are perceived as taxing, in Black adults is associated with haphazard meal planning and increased consumption of high-fat/high-sugar foods. Stress in parents/caregivers (here on referred to as ""caregivers"") is associated with child obesity, fast food consumption, and decreased vegetable intake. Differential use of coping styles in Blacks and Whites has been postulated as a cause for health disparities. There is evidence that compared with Whites, Blacks are more likely to use religious and culturally influenced coping. Both of these types of coping have aspects that either increase the risk of obesity (negative coping) or decrease the risk of obesity (positive coping). A mixed-methods design will be used to identify how stress and coping influence parenting behaviors that may be associated with child obesity. The research aims are: (1) to characterize the relationships among stress, coping skills and parenting behaviors of Black caregivers that promote child obesity; and (2) to measure the association of stress and culturally-influenced and religious coping styles with parenting behaviors of Black caregivers that promote child obesity. To accomplish these aims, first a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews will be used to characterize the influence of stress and coping on parenting related to child obesity in 48 caregivers of children ages 3-7 years. Second, a cross-sectional study will measure these relationships in 164 caregivers and their children ages 3-7 years. This study will be conducted in the Black church community to reflect the fact that 85% of Blacks consider themselves a part of Black church culture. These studies will inform future projects that develop and test interventions to prevent child obesity and future cancer risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African-Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with and suffer greater complications from cancer, often as a result of obesity, decreased physical activity  and poor nutrition. These behaviors that increase the risk of cancer often begin in childhood under the influence of parents.

"Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Black Americans carry a disproportionate burden of social risk factors for poor mental health, such as living in violent urban environments and experiencing economic deprivation and discrimination. Despite these risks, Black Americans have lower lifetime prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders than Whites. The reasons for Black Americans' resilience to these mental health disorders are unknown. This proposal aims to examine cumulative adversity and subsequent diminished neurobiological stress response as a possible explanation of Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and depression. It also aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this resilience. These aims will be accomplished by conducting research interviews with 1,306 young adults (age 20-21; 60% Black, 40% White; 50% female) from an existing community sample who have been previously assessed three times during childhood and adolescence. These research interviews will provide information on adversity experienced by the participants, categorical diagnoses and dimensional measures of internalizing distress, and physiological indicators of reactivity to stress. Neural bases of stress response will be evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for a subset of 120 Black and 120 White participants from the larger study. This study is innovative because it proposes to test a novel mechanism explaining the resilience of Black Americans to depression and anxiety, incorporates both categorical and dimensional measures of internalizing problems, and examines the role of physiological stress response and regulatory neural circuit in the resilience process. The results will have important implications for our understanding of racial disparities i anxiety and depression, neurobiological mechanisms underlying resilience to stress, and relationships between environmental stress, neural and physiological response, and negative affect. These findings will point to novel ways to diagnose and treat mental health problems in Black and White Americans.          Black Americans are exposed to more adversity than White Americans, yet they experience lower rates of anxiety and depressive disorders. The proposed project investigates cumulative adversity and diminished neurobiological stress response as causal mechanisms underlying Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and mood disorders. The findings will improve our understanding of the role of adversity and neurobiological stress system in anxiety and depression and suggest novel approaches to diagnose and treat these mental health problems in Black and White Americans.

"Role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and social stress on perinatal outcomes  Project Summary/Abstract The goal of my K99/R00 career development plan is to launch an independent research program in reproductive and environmental epidemiology of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which includes evaluating social determinants of health that may affect overlapping biologic pathways. To accomplish this goal, I will enhance my expertise in environmental health sciences with didactic and hands-on training in reproductive biology, social epidemiology/stress science, and environmental epidemiologic methods. This specialized training will allow me to achieve my long term goal of becoming an independent academic investigator and offering new insights on the cumulative impacts of environmental and social factors on reproductive health.  The primary goal of my research plan is to evaluate the independent effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and psychosocial stress on thyroid hormone disruption and consequent perinatal outcomes among a population of socioeconomically and racially diverse pregnant women. This work is particularly innovative as both PBDEs and psychosocial stress can impact the thyroid system, suggesting a biologic plausibility for interaction, however the two exposures have never been examined simultaneously in a human study. During the K99 mentored phase, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tracey Woodruff, I will use innovative measures to characterize biologically-relevant exposures to PBDEs and psychosocial stress and their effects on thyroid hormone disruption. Exposure to PBDEs will be assessed using both PBDE congeners as well as their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PBDEs). Psychosocial stress will be evaluated with subjective measures of stress and telomere length, a biomarker of cellular aging that is influenced by psychosocial stress. In the independent phase, I will apply this knowledge to investigate the independent effects of PBDEs and psychosocial stress on adverse perinatal outcomes, such as gestational hypertension, preterm birth, and low birth weight, and assess whether these effects are mediated via the thyroid system. The integration of this work will enable me to develop the necessary methodological and biological frameworks to examine the combined, and potentially synergistic, effects of environmental and psychosocial factors on perinatal outcomes in future R01 studies. I am well positioned to accomplish these goals at the University of California, San Francisco, a highly respected research institution, with a strong environmental reproductive health program, a world-renowned faculty with expertise in psychosocial stress, and an extensive biomedical infrastructure. My primary mentor and co-mentors in reproductive sciences, environmental epidemiology, health disparities, stress science, and biostatistics will guide the process whereby I learn the methods that are required to accomplish the goals set forth in this proposal. This project represents the cutting-edge of health disparities and environmental health research and seeks to answer critical scientific as well as policy-relevant questions for improving the health of vulnerable populations who often face disproportionate and elevated exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors.    Project Narrative The goal of this project is to prepare Dr. Ami Zota to transition to a position as an independent academic investigator in environmental health sciences focusing on the consequence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy and social factors that may affect overlapping biologic pathways. She will conduct epidemiologic analyses to investigate the effects of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants and psychosocial stress on perinatal outcomes and assess whether these effects are mediated by the thyroid system. Results from this work will improve pregnancy outcomes and inform public health policy, particularly for vulnerable subpopulations, who often encounter elevated exposures to chemical and non-chemical

"Sex Gender Differences in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Females are twice as likely as males to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or severe PTSD symptoms (PTS) following trauma exposure. Evidence suggests that this disparity may, in part, have a biological basis: trauma exposure can be biologically embedded via acquired epigenetic alterations that affect stress reactivity to even mild future stressors. Thus, sex differences in PTSD/PTS may be mediated, in part, by acquired epigenetic modifications. The long-term goal of the planned line of research is to contribute to the development of strategies to reduce sex/gender inequities associated with PTSD. The immediate objective of the proposed multidisciplinary pilot study is to collect information needed to design a full-scale R01 investigation of factors that might underlie observed sex/gender differences in PTSD/PTS.  The planned R21 study would leverage the infrastructure and resources of an ongoing R01 investigation to obtain epigenetic information on a subgroup at especially high risk for PTSD/PTS, i.e., Latino survivors of serious physical injury. Building on the R01 study design, which would entail interviews with physical injury survivors within days of hospitalization and at 5-month follow-up, the planned pilot study would collect blood samples from a subsample of 100 (i.e., 50 males/50 females) at both interviews. Blood data will be linked with interview data to gather preliminary information about the likely magnitude of key epigenetic effects and to determine which of several different genes involved in stress regulation and vulnerability are most promising for further R01 study of sex/gender differences in PTSD.  The planned R21 has the following specific aims: (1) To explore the magnitude and direction of cross-sectional associations between methylation at loci of four  stress- and mood-related genes (PACAP, NR3C1, RORA, ESR1) and lifetime trauma history (number of  events, event severity, type, and chronicity) and baseline PTS in Latino men and women. (2) To determine the degree to which methylation of PACAP, NR3C1, RORA, and ESR1 at the initial post-injury  assessment can explain the link between sex and subsequent PTSD/PTS, after accounting for lifetime  trauma exposure. (3) To appraise whether post-trauma changes in methylation of PACAP, NR3C1, RORA, and ESR1 can be  detected at 5-month follow-up, and whether the magnitude of any change is related to sex or to PTSD/PTS.  The knowledge obtained from the proposed research has the potential to accelerate efforts aimed at reducing PTSD-related sex/gender disparities. Specifically, insofar as epigenetic processes are modifiable, this line of research can lay the foundation for tailored interventions to prevent or treat PTSD/PTSS in men and women. This research may also result in identification of novel biomarkers of vulnerability to PTSD, and insights into whether these markers are sex-specific.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research seeks to understand why women are twice as likely as men to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following serious physical injury. PTSD is a major cause of human suffering, and study findings will lay the foundation for the development of novel strategies to reduce and prevent PTSD.            ",Sex Gender Differences in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8682833,R21MH103686,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Physical Examination ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide ', ' PACAP ', ' pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide ', ' Gender ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' peripheral blood ', ' insight ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' stressor ', ' sensor (biological) ', ' Biosensor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Early identification ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' NR3C1 ', ' NR3C1 gene ', ' RZRA ', ' RORA ', ' ROR3 ', ' ROR2 ', ' ROR1 ', ' NR1F1 ', ' RORA gene ', ' NR3A1 ', ' ESR1 ', ' ESR1 gene ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' preclinical trial ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Trauma ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2014,203798,0.0025792327642471828
"Prenatal Pollution, Stress and Maternal-child Health: Role of Immunomodulation  Project Summary The goal of this career development plan is to launch an independent research career in children's environmental health, specializing in climate change research, with a focus on the health vulnerabilities of children. Climate change will impact health by changing the landscape with respect to allergens, pollution, extreme storms, and thermal stress. The health care community can best reduce the burden of climate change on health through targeted interventions for specific vulnerabilities. Research on these vulnerabilities requires advanced epidemiologic skills. This career development plan will build on the candidate's formal training in pediatrics to obtain the background in environmental epidemiology needed to develop hypotheses and design environmental health studies that are well-grounded in biological mechanisms of toxicity. This plan incorporates didactic training in environmental epidemiology and complex statistical techniques. The research component builds on a dual-site prenatal cohort recruited in Boston and New York: the Programming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) study. The research will examine the role of prenatal air pollution, psychosocial stress, and immune mechanisms in maternal-child health. The candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Preventive Medicine and Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, a nationally and internationally recognized center of excellence in preventive medicine, occupational and environmental medicine, community health, and environmental pediatrics. An interdisciplinary mentorship team has been selected to provide guidance and expertise in environmental epidemiology, psychosocial stress, immunology, and psychiatry. The proposed training and research program will position the candidate to work effectively with a number of active, multidisciplinary groups at the completion of the award period. The project is guided by the following career objectives: 1) to gain knowledge on diverse methods of spatial modeling for social and physical environmental exposure assessment; 2) to gain experience working with observed and modeled climate data, in particular, downscaled climate model outputs; 3) to develop expertise in advanced statistical methods relevant to climate and health work specifically focusing on air pollution, stress, and inflammatory biomarkers; 4) to acquire familiarity with additional climate-sensitive outcomes such as birth and mental health outcomes and mechanistic intermediaries. This career development plan will facilitate the candidate becoming a leading expert and independent investigator in children's environmental health and advance the NIH's mission to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.   Public Health Relevance: Climate change is estimated to result in over 200,000 premature deaths per year - over 80% of which are among children - and projected to cause additional health effects in the coming decades. Air pollution and psychosocial stress exposures, and the underlying immune mechanisms of maternal and child health are important climate-sensitive factors in this public health issue. This project aims to build the epidemiologic skills of a pediatrician dedicated to finding ways to reduce climate health impacts both within the USA and globally.                  ","Prenatal Pollution, Stress and Maternal-child Health: Role of Immunomodulation",8749143,K23ES024127,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Allergens ', ' Award ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Boston ', ' Carbon Black ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' New York ', ' Occupational or Industrial Medicine ', ' Industrial Medicine ', ' Occupational Medicine ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Play ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Immunology ', ' career ', ' Perinatal ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Postnatal Depression ', ' Post-Partum Depression ', ' Post-Natal Depression ', ' Postpartum Depression ', ' disability ', ' pediatrician ', ' Development Plans ', ' Maternal Exposure ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Environmental Medicine ', ' Pollution ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal stress ', ' prenatal stress ', ' Particulate ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' intergenerational ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Familiarity ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immune modulation ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immunoregulation ', ' novel ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' land use ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' thermo stress ', ' thermal stress ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2014,160230,0.11444613432168389
"RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULTS' PATHWAYS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong African American Families Healthy Adult Project (SHAPE) followed 493 African American youth from ages 11 to 20. Participants have grown up in rural Georgia communities in which poverty rates for African Americans are among the highest in the nation. Life in rural areas can be more challenging than in urban areas due to restricted educational and employment opportunities, difficulties in obtaining physical and mental health care, and a lack of public transportation. Despite living in such challenging situations, many SHAPE participants have displayed high levels of psychosocial functioning across adolescence. We identified naturally occurring factors in family and community networks that protected these youth from the consequences of SES- and race-related stressors that proliferate in rural Southern contexts. Epidemiological research reveals that African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of chronic diseases of aging (CDA) such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence indicates that contemporaneous health determinants in midlife or later cannot adequately account for why rural African Americans experience high rates of CDAs. Rather, many CDAs incubate in physiological systems for decades prior to the manifestation of disease. In the next 5 years, SHAPE participants will experience a stressful developmental transition. Job turnover rates are high, and the combined effects of poor preparation for employment and discriminatory hiring practices make obtaining stable employment a protracted and often demoralizing process. These stressors have the potential to take a toll on SHAPE participants' health, undermining psychosocial functioning and contributing to CDA-related vulnerabilities. To understand the pathways from stress exposure during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood to CDA vulnerabilities and psychosocial outcomes, we propose to extend the SHAPE research program in two key ways. First we propose to augment our health assessment of SHAPE participants to include markers of metabolic syndrome and pro-inflammatory tendencies which are linked to the development of CDAs. Second, we propose to investigate a critical question for public health scientists and practitioners. In response to stress exposure, some SHAPE participants will evince escalation in CDA vulnerability whereas other will not. This proposal is designed to investigate why. Evidence from laboratory-based studies suggests a central role for psychosocial risk and protective mechanisms in young adulthood and earlier phases of development in altering the pathways linking stress exposure and CDA precursors. Prospective research investigating these risk and protective mechanisms, however, is virtually nonexistent. We thus propose to collect data from SHAPE participants, at ages 22 and 24 years, that includes CDA precursors along with assessments of environmental stressors, psychosocial adjustment, risk and protective mechanisms, HPA axis/SNS deregulation, and health behavior.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of health disparities. Recent research suggests that the roots of these disparities lie in earlier stages of development as young people cope with stressful environments. In this study we investigate the risk and protective processes that explain why some young adult rural African Americans develop vulnerabilities to chronic diseases and others do not.            ",RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULTS' PATHWAYS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH,8761711,R01HD030588,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' 4-(1-Hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl)-1,2-benzenediol ', ' 1,2-Benzenediol, 4-(1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl)-, (R)- ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Laboratories ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' 1,2-Benzenediol, 4-(2-amino-1-hydroxyethyl)-, (R)- ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Stress ', ' Sympathetic Nervous System ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Weather ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Incubated ', ' Data ', ' Proliferating ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2014,632673,0.058360032826123245
"Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent research suggests that chronic early life stress may pose serious threats to child well-being and set individuals on pathways towards increased physical and mental health problems in adulthood. In addition to being a key health input across the life course, chronic stress is produced through individuals' responses to their environments and thus reflects the interaction of social contexts with biological processes. Improving population health and reducing health disparities necessitates that we understand these socio-biological interactions, particularly during the early stages of the life course when physiological changes may become biologically embedded.  This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in Population Research application addresses this critical research need by proposing a training plan and research agenda that will build on my sociology, family demography and child health background to become an independent, innovative researcher in the area of social contexts, chronic stress and health during childhood. To achieve this goal, I propose formal training and mentoring in the biology of stress, collection and analysi of stress biomarkers, child development, and multilevel modeling. My highly-qualified team of mentors and advisory committee members come from the fields of sociology, demography, epidemiology, nursing, and psychology, reflecting the need for a multi- disciplinary approach in conducting research that integrates biological and social processes.  I will use my training and mentoring in these new areas to answer important research questions about how family contexts are associated with chronic stress in children, and the implications of chronic stress for child health and health disparities in the U.S. In the past four decades, there have been large and pervasive shifts in children's family contexts towards unmarried and unstable parental unions, which are often accompanied by socioeconomic disadvantage. Research suggests that these contexts contribute to child health and development disadvantages and the reproduction of social inequalities across generations. However, there has been little attention to assessing chronic stress as a pathway through which family contexts affect child health.  The expected outcome of this project is paradigm-shifting research that incorporates biological mechanisms into our conceptualization and empirical tests of family context effects on child well-being. Importantly, the conclusions will go beyond a comparison of married vs. unmarried mother families to consider diverse family structures and processes as they impact child stress and health. Using multilevel and population-based data will advance our understanding of the influence of larger social contexts (i.e., neighborhoods and social status) on these processes and will provide generalizable results. These are critical next steps in child health, family demography, and stress research that will set the stage for future research and policy development aimed at reducing chronic stress and health disparities in children.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children's family environments have changed dramatically over the past 40 years in the U.S., with potentially important implications for their stress and health. Adverse or unstable family contexts may produce chronic stress in children due to the need for predictability in family relationships and adequate resources (of all types) for healthy child development. Chronic stress, in turn, may pose threats to children's physical, emotional and cognitive development. Understanding the extent to which increasingly diverse and unstable family environments are associated with chronic stress in children, and delineating pathways linking family structure, stress and child outcomes, are important next steps in family demography and child health research. This research will further our understanding of the role of family structure and instability as social determinants of child stress, and biological mechanisms through which family contexts contribute to the reproduction of health and social inequalities.            ","Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children",8700851,K01HD077063,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Siblings ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Policies ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' single motherhood ', ' Unmarried Mother ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Mediating ', ' Unmarried ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' family structure ', ' social inequality ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Population Research ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cognitive ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiology Nursing ', ' Family Sociology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Family Process ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' family influence ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' population health ', ' ']",NICHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2014,128450,0.20736118272593346
"Measuring Stress Among Diverse Adolescents     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposed R21 exploratory research is to explore the intersection of minority stress for adolescents who identify as sexual (lesbian, gay, bisexual) and racial/ethnic minority and to develop and validate a sexual minority adolescent stress instrument (SMASI). The production of a valid measure of minority stress for this population will have a significant public health impact by allowing for more precise assessment of the relationship between minority stress experiences (social processes) and negative mental and behavioral health outcomes in this higher risk population. Adapted from effective methods used in similar NIH research with ethnic minority adolescents, the proposed research will result in the development of a valid measure of minority stress that can be used to inform clinical assessment and the development of effective targeted behavioral health interventions. The objectives will be met through two specific aims, including: a) Create a preliminary Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI) through a modified Delphi process with an expert panel; and b) Refine the instrument and assess its reliability and preliminary criterion validity in a cross- sectional study of racially and ethnically diverse sexua minority adolescents (N=410). This study will apply a mixed method, multi-phase design to the development of the SMASI. During the first year, a preliminary SMASI will be developed using a modified Delphi process with an interdisciplinary subject matter expert panel, followed by youth cognitive interviews (n=20) to ensure comprehensibility of the draft measure. Phase II will occur in the second year of the study, when a racially and ethnically diverse range of SMA (n=410) will be recruited using respondent driven sampling to complete the draft measure. Analysis of phase II will focus on establishing reliability and preliminary criterion validity, and the production ofa final SMASI. Upon completion of this R21, a multi-year study will be conducted to examine the longitudinal relationship between minority stress experiences and mental and behavioral outcomes in a large sample of racially and ethnically diverse youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We have proposed a study to develop an instrument to measure minority stress among racial and ethnically diverse lesbian, gay and bisexual adolescents. While this population consistently reports an array of health disparities when compared to heterosexual counterparts, little exists to measure the impact of minority status on these outcomes; thus the relationship between these stressors and negative health outcomes remains unclear. The results of this project will allow for operationalization of minority stress constructs for adolescents, provide direction for the development of targeted health interventions, and provide an opportunity to measure minority stress through subsequent longitudinal design.            ",Measuring Stress Among Diverse Adolescents,8822638,R21HD082813,"['Anxiety ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' Caucasians ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Ensure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' instrument ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' minority health ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia  ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' LGBT Health ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2014,264753,0.055577865055376055
"Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender people are a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. They express their gender-variant identity in various ways and through a multitude of self- labels, both within and outside of binary conceptualizations of sex/gender as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine. While public awareness of this diversity has grown, our understanding of transgender people's experience is limited by a lack of systematic research on their identity development. Health inequities documented among the U.S. transgender population include depression (44%), suicidal ideation (54%) and attempts (31%), anxiety (33%), smoking (36%), and HIV infection (12% based on self- report; 28% on testing). Social stigma attached to gender nonconformity has been proposed as a major contributing factor to these health inequities. Previous research found that the vast majority of transgender individuals experienced discrimination. Much of the data, however, is limited by the use of small convenience samples of transgender women with a history of sex work, recruited from AIDS and social service agencies. The goal of this study is to move beyond these limitations by using purposive, venue-based sampling to recruit a broad, diverse sample of transgender people in 3 U.S. cities--New York, San Francisco, and Atlanta-and enroll them into a mixed-method longitudinal study to test an adaptation of the minority stress model, investigating vulnerability, risk and resilience in the context of identity development. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the process of transgender identity development based on qualitative lifeline interviews with a sample of 90 transgender individuals ages 16 and older, and identify periods of acute vulnerability and characteristics of resilience; (2) Informed by findings from Aim 1, to refine a model combining identity development, minority stress, and resilience, and to develop/adapt measures to assess the model's key constructs; (3) To test the model of resilience in a cohort of transgender individuals (N = 480) stratified by city, gender, and age, and follow them over time (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow up interviews); and (4) To triangulate qualitative and quantitative data on identity development and minority stress processes in order to inform the future development and testing of intervention strategies aimed at fostering resilience and reducing stigma and discrimination. By achieving these aims, this study will make a significant advance in scientific knowledge about gender identity development, minority stress processes (enacted stigma, felts stigma, concealment, shame and their impact on health and psychosocial adjustment), minority coping (on an individual as well as community level), and the development of resilience over time. The study is innovative in its focus on an understudied minority population, the application of the lifeline interview method to this population, and the adaptation and testing of the minority stress model within the context of transgender identity development.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research to date has found inequities in mental health, substance use, HIV infection, and other health concerns among gender nonconforming people in the United States. This study takes a longitudinal, mixed- method approach to uncover the mechanism of how stigma and minority stress affect health and psychosocial development among this population, identifying periods of acute vulnerability and corresponding resilience. Findings will inform the development of future intervention strategies aimed at reducing stigma and promoting the health and wellbeing of this and other vulnerable populations.            ","Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse Populations",8815604,R01HD079603,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' gay (sexual orientation) ', ' Homosexuals ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hormones ', ' Interview ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Shame ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Social work (field) ', ' Stress ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Acute ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Feminine ', ' Masculine ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' transsexual ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' psychosocial development ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' public health relevance ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2014,658855,0.06362007634242797
"Stress and Type 2 Diabetes among Indigenous Adults     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised RO1 application is in response to the Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases Program Announcement (PA-09-262). It focuses on American Indians (AI) whose rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the highest in the world. This population also copes with disproportionate stressors including economic disadvantage, unemployment, community violence, discrimination, and the long- term effects of historical cultural traumas and losses. Yet, paradoxically, AI people tend to score lower on some self-report measures of stress and have lower prevalence rates of stress-related mental disorders such as major depressive episode and anxiety disorders. The goals of the proposed research are to advance measurement of stress processes among AI people through comparisons of stress biomarkers and self-report measures; and to use multiple indicators of stress including stress biomarkers to investigate the interactions between stress processes T2D disease progression and treatment compliance among AI adults. This community based participatory research is based on partnerships with five Ojibwe reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin who invited the research team to work with their clinics. The first specific aim is to couple our existing preliminary data on community salient stressors with new qualitative feedback on existing measures to adapt and subsequently examine via pilot surveys the psychometric properties of stress measures for this population. The second specific aim is to investigate the relationship between stress biomarkers and self-reported psychosocial stressors, symptoms of distress, and diagnostic measures of anxiety, depression, and trauma to ascertain the degree to which self report measures are indicative of actual physiological stress levels among a cohort of 200 AI adults who have been recently diagnosed with T2D. The third specific aim is to follow a cohort of 200 recently diagnosed T2D AI adults for two years to investigate an innovative conceptual model (Figure 1) of multiple measures of stress processes, treatment compliance, mental health, and risk factors for disease complications          This health disparities research will advance our understanding of stress processes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) among American Indian (AI) people by refining measures of stress among this population through use of stress biomarkers and cultural adaptation/development of self-report stress measures.

"Air pollution, stress and urban child development    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasingly, prospective epidemiological studies link maternal stress during pregnancy with adverse neurodevelopment in children. Recent evidence also suggests that perinatal ambient air pollution exposure may have neurotoxic effects. While historically research has focused on how social and physical environmental factors independently affect children's health, evolving research underscores the importance of studying interactive effects. Moreover, marginalized populations of lower-socioeconomic position (SEP) are exposed disproportionately to traffic- related pollutants while living in adverse social circumstances or communities that are ""socially"" toxic. Consequently, these populations experience both increased stress and increased chemical pollution. Social x chemical interactions may account for more variance in explaining risk than the main effects of either factor alone. Relevant studies in urban populations are rare and none assess stress and air pollution together. Studies of mechanistic pathways linking perinatal air pollution and/or stress to neurodevelopment are equally sparse. We take advantage of an established pregnancy cohort - the Asthma Coalition on Community, Environment, and Social Stress (ACCESS) project (R01 HL080674, RJ Wright PI), with prospectively characterized exposure to ambient pollutants starting in pregnancy coupled with extensive assessment of pre- and postnatal stress, as well as relevant confounders and mediators. We can draw from our biomarker archive including assessments of prenatal maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (e.g., cortisol), infant autonomic nervous system (ANS) and HPA axis function at age 6 months, and DNA banked for future genetic assays to explore mechanisms. In this application, we are proposing the addition of neurocognitive and behavioral testing in n=815 ACCESS children at age 6 years. We will then test the main effects of perinatal exposure to chronic ambient air pollution and/or psychological stress on these neuropsychiatric outcomes. We will next examine whether air pollution effects are modified by psychosocial stress. Mechanisms to be explored include perinatal stress (& air pollution)-elicited disruption in the maternal prenatal HPA axis and the child's HPA axis and ANS response. Finally, to further explore biological mechanisms by which air pollutants and stress impact neurodevelopment, genetic susceptibility factors will be examined.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the effects of perinatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution on childhood neurobehavioral and cognitive development in urban children. In addition to independent effects of air pollution, the study will also examine the potential modifying effects of the social environment (i.e., psychological stress) and genetic susceptibility on these relationships. Such knowledge may inform efforts to design programs that improve neurodevelopmental trajectories in high-risk urban populations disproportionately exposed to adverse physical and social environments.","Air pollution, stress and urban child development",8706705,R01MD006086,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ',

"Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Black Americans carry a disproportionate burden of social risk factors for poor mental health, such as living in violent urban environments and experiencing economic deprivation and discrimination. Despite these risks, Black Americans have lower lifetime prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders than Whites. The reasons for Black Americans' resilience to these mental health disorders are unknown. This proposal aims to examine cumulative adversity and subsequent diminished neurobiological stress response as a possible explanation of Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and depression. It also aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this resilience. These aims will be accomplished by conducting research interviews with 1,306 young adults (age 20-21; 60% Black, 40% White; 50% female) from an existing community sample who have been previously assessed three times during childhood and adolescence. These research interviews will provide information on adversity experienced by the participants, categorical diagnoses and dimensional measures of internalizing distress, and physiological indicators of reactivity to stress. Neural bases of stress response will be evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for a subset of 120 Black and 120 White participants from the larger study. This study is innovative because it proposes to test a novel mechanism explaining the resilience of Black Americans to depression and anxiety, incorporates both categorical and dimensional measures of internalizing problems, and examines the role of physiological stress response and regulatory neural circuit in the resilience process. The results will have important implications for our understanding of racial disparities i anxiety and depression, neurobiological mechanisms underlying resilience to stress, and relationships between environmental stress, neural and physiological response, and negative affect. These findings will point to novel ways to diagnose and treat mental health problems in Black and White Americans. Black Americans are exposed to more adversity than White Americans, yet they experience lower rates of anxiety and depressive disorders. The proposed project investigates cumulative adversity and diminished neurobiological stress response as causal mechanisms underlying Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and mood disorders. The findings will improve our understanding of the role of adversity and neurobiological stress system in anxiety and depression and suggest novel approaches to diagnose and treat these mental health problems in Black and White Americans.",Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans,8917393,R01MH098348,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Electromyography ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Diagnostic ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Brain region ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' Prevalence ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2014,76984,0.05145127076230256
"Measuring Stress Among Diverse Adolescents     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The objective of this proposed R21 exploratory research is to explore the intersection of minority stress for adolescents who identify as sexual (lesbian, gay, bisexual) and racial/ethnic minority and to develop and validate a sexual minority adolescent stress instrument (SMASI). The production of a valid measure of minority stress for this population will have a significant public health impact by allowing for more precise assessment of the relationship between minority stress experiences (social processes) and negative mental and behavioral health outcomes in this higher risk population. Adapted from effective methods used in similar NIH research with ethnic minority adolescents, the proposed research will result in the development of a valid measure of minority stress that can be used to inform clinical assessment and the development of effective targeted behavioral health interventions. The objectives will be met through two specific aims, including: a) Create a preliminary Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI) through a modified Delphi process with an expert panel; and b) Refine the instrument and assess its reliability and preliminary criterion validity in a cross- sectional study of racially and ethnically diverse sexua minority adolescents (N=410). This study will apply a mixed method, multi-phase design to the development of the SMASI. During the first year, a preliminary SMASI will be developed using a modified Delphi process with an interdisciplinary subject matter expert panel, followed by youth cognitive interviews (n=20) to ensure comprehensibility of the draft measure. Phase II will occur in the second year of the study, when a racially and ethnically diverse range of SMA (n=410) will be recruited using respondent driven sampling to complete the draft measure. Analysis of phase II will focus on establishing reliability and preliminary criterion validity, and the production ofa final SMASI. Upon completion of this R21, a multi-year study will be conducted to examine the longitudinal relationship between minority stress experiences and mental and behavioral outcomes in a large sample of racially and ethnically diverse youth.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  We have proposed a study to develop an instrument to measure minority stress among racial and ethnically diverse lesbian, gay and bisexual adolescents. While this population consistently reports an array of health disparities when compared to heterosexual counterparts, little exists to measure the impact of minority status on these outcomes; thus the relationship between these stressors and negative health outcomes remains unclear. The results of this project will allow for operationalization of minority stress constructs for adolescents, provide direction for the development of targeted health interventions, and provide an opportunity to measure minority stress through subsequent longitudinal design.            ",Measuring Stress Among Diverse Adolescents,8931800,R21HD082813,"['Anxiety ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Health ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Incidence ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Inventory ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Production ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' suicidality ', ' intent to die ', ' fatal suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' Suicide ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' racism ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Ensure ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Respondent ', ' instrument ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' minority health ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia  ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' LGBT Health ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2015,202050,0.055577865055376055
"Stress and Type 2 Diabetes among Indigenous Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised RO1 application is in response to the Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases Program Announcement (PA-09-262). It focuses on American Indians (AI) whose rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the highest in the world. This population also copes with disproportionate stressors including economic disadvantage, unemployment, community violence, discrimination, and the long- term effects of historical cultural traumas and losses. Yet, paradoxically, AI people tend to score lower on some self-report measures of stress and have lower prevalence rates of stress-related mental disorders such as major depressive episode and anxiety disorders. The goals of the proposed research are to advance measurement of stress processes among AI people through comparisons of stress biomarkers and self-report measures; and to use multiple indicators of stress including stress biomarkers to investigate the interactions between stress processes T2D disease progression and treatment compliance among AI adults. This community based participatory research is based on partnerships with five Ojibwe reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin who invited the research team to work with their clinics. The first specific aim is to couple our existing preliminary data on community salient stressors with new qualitative feedback on existing measures to adapt and subsequently examine via pilot surveys the psychometric properties of stress measures for this population. The second specific aim is to investigate the relationship between stress biomarkers and self-reported psychosocial stressors, symptoms of distress, and diagnostic measures of anxiety, depression, and trauma to ascertain the degree to which self report measures are indicative of actual physiological stress levels among a cohort of 200 AI adults who have been recently diagnosed with T2D. The third specific aim is to follow a cohort of 200 recently diagnosed T2D AI adults for two years to investigate an innovative conceptual model (Figure 1) of multiple measures of stress processes, treatment compliance, mental health, and risk factors for disease complications This health disparities research will advance our understanding of stress processes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) among American Indian (AI) people by refining measures of stress among this population through use of stress biomarkers and cultural adaptation/development of self-report stress measures. It will then prospectively investigate the effects of stress on T2D disease progression by following a cohort of 200 newly diagnosed AI adults for a period of two years.",Stress and Type 2 Diabetes

"Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now large-scale epidemiological evidence that aspects of chronic psychological stress, such as early adversity or job strain, and early life stress, predict earlier disease onset and mortality. Despite documentation of the importance of stress to health, there are several critical barriers that prevent progress in the epidemiological study of stress as a risk factor for disease. Measurement of stress is inherently complex and multi-level (e.g., social, psychological, physiological). There are few agreed upon 'gold standard' measures of stress, hence measurement is often inconsistent and superficial where heterogeneous constructs are conflated. There is also little understanding of the conditions under which stress exposure can promote vulnerability vs. resiliency to disease. Meanwhile, there have been rapid advances in the basic science of stress processes, which have helped to unpack the cognitive and affective components, links to brain and peripheral physiological responses, and richer measures of daily stress - e.g., through ecological momentary assessments using technology to obtain detailed profiles of exposures and contexts. Thus, epidemiological stress science can benefit from a more coherent multilevel model that encompasses better measurement of lifespan exposures and responses, including the social, psychological, and physiological indices of stress that have the greatest impact on health. The proposed R24 will recruit excellent scientists with relevant methods to apply their interests to th advancement of stress measurement across human development, with a focus on how lifespan stress affects health in mid to late life. Aims include: 1) Development of a stress measurement taxonomy, including guidelines for best measurement; 2) Development of a 'toolbox' of short measures of stress that can be used in epidemiological studies of adult aging internationally. These will be drawn from innovative measurement from basic experimental and field research, refinement/shortening of existing measures, and results from comparative validation of promising measures; and 3) Promotion of stress research in epidemiological studies of aging, both through harmonizing existing measures and adding new toolbox measures. This in turn will lead to discoveries that refine the taxonomy and research methodologies. Improved stress measurement offers tremendous opportunities for advancing the field of basic research, enhancing the efficacy of health-promotion interventions and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic stress can impair health, but the mechanisms are not well known and the measures that investigators use are diverse and inconsistent. This network will promote better theory and new measures, and develop a ""stress measurement toolbox,"" that large-scale studies can use. This in turn will lead to a deeper understanding of how stress affects psychological well-being as well as disease etiology and progression, and ways to intervene.",Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging,8917843,R24AG048024,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Comparative Study ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' indexing ', ' Internships ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Paper ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' field study ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' validation studies ', ' Impaired health ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Skin ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' comparative ', ' critical period ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' standard measure ', ' population health ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R24,2015,270431,0.1939187416217695
"Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent research suggests that chronic early life stress may pose serious threats to child well-being and set individuals on pathways towards increased physical and mental health problems in adulthood. In addition to being a key health input across the life course, chronic stress is produced through individuals' responses to their environments and thus reflects the interaction of social contexts with biological processes. Improving population health and reducing health disparities necessitates that we understand these socio-biological interactions, particularly during the early stages of the life course when physiological changes may become biologically embedded.  This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in Population Research application addresses this critical research need by proposing a training plan and research agenda that will build on my sociology, family demography and child health background to become an independent, innovative researcher in the area of social contexts, chronic stress and health during childhood. To achieve this goal, I propose formal training and mentoring in the biology of stress, collection and analysi of stress biomarkers, child development, and multilevel modeling. My highly-qualified team of mentors and advisory committee members come from the fields of sociology, demography, epidemiology, nursing, and psychology, reflecting the need for a multi- disciplinary approach in conducting research that integrates biological and social processes.  I will use my training and mentoring in these new areas to answer important research questions about how family contexts are associated with chronic stress in children, and the implications of chronic stress for child health and health disparities in the U.S. In the past four decades, there have been large and pervasive shifts in children's family contexts towards unmarried and unstable parental unions, which are often accompanied by socioeconomic disadvantage. Research suggests that these contexts contribute to child health and development disadvantages and the reproduction of social inequalities across generations. However, there has been little attention to assessing chronic stress as a pathway through which family contexts affect child health.  The expected outcome of this project is paradigm-shifting research that incorporates biological mechanisms into our conceptualization and empirical tests of family context effects on child well-being. Importantly, the conclusions will go beyond a comparison of married vs. unmarried mother families to consider diverse family structures and processes as they impact child stress and health. Using multilevel and population-based data will advance our understanding of the influence of larger social contexts (i.e., neighborhoods and social status) on these processes and will provide generalizable results. These are critical next steps in child health, family demography, and stress research that will set the stage for future research and policy development aimed at reducing chronic stress and health disparities in children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children's family environments have changed dramatically over the past 40 years in the U.S., with potentially important implications for their stress and health. Adverse or unstable family contexts may produce chronic stress in children due to the need for predictability in family relationships and adequate resources (of all types) for healthy child development. Chronic stress, in turn, may pose threats to children's physical, emotional and cognitive development. Understanding the extent to which increasingly diverse and unstable family environments are associated with chronic stress in children, and delineating pathways linking family structure, stress and child outcomes, are important next steps in family demography and child health research. This research will further our understanding of the role of family structure and instability as social determinants of child stress, and biological mechanisms through which family contexts contribute to the reproduction of health and social inequalities.","Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children",8856296,K01HD077063,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Population Studies / Demography ', ' Demography ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Siblings ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Policies ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' single motherhood ', ' Unmarried Mother ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Unmarried ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' family structure ', ' social inequality ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Population Research ', ' Qualifying ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiology Nursing ', ' Family Sociology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Family Process ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' family influence ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' population health ', ' ']",NICHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2015,128450,0.20736118272593346
"Prenatal Pollution, Stress and Maternal-child Health: Role of Immunomodulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The goal of this Career Development Plan is to launch an independent research career in children's environmental health, specializing in climate change research, with a focus on the health vulnerabilities of children. Climate change will impact health by changing the landscape with respect to allergens, pollution, extreme storms, and thermal stress. The health care community can best reduce the burden of climate change on health through targeted interventions for specific vulnerabilities. Research on these vulnerabilities requires advanced epidemiologic skills. This Career Development Plan will build on the candidate's formal training in pediatrics to obtain the background in environmental epidemiology needed to develop hypotheses and design environmental health studies that are well-grounded in biological mechanisms of toxicity. This plan incorporates didactic training in environmental epidemiology and complex statistical techniques. The research component builds on a dual-site prenatal cohort recruited in Boston and New York: the Programming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) study. The research will examine the role of prenatal air pollution, psychosocial stress, and immune mechanisms in maternal-child health. The candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Preventive Medicine and Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, a nationally and internationally recognized center of excellence in preventive medicine, occupational and environmental medicine, community health, and environmental pediatrics. An interdisciplinary mentorship team has been selected to provide guidance and expertise in environmental epidemiology, psychosocial stress, immunology, and psychiatry. The proposed training and research program will position the candidate to work effectively with a number of active, multidisciplinary groups at the completion of the award period. The project is guided by the following career objectives: 1) to gain knowledge on diverse methods of spatial modeling for social and physical environmental exposure assessment; 2) to gain experience working with observed and modeled climate data, in particular, downscaled climate model outputs; 3) to develop expertise in advanced statistical methods relevant to climate and health work specifically focusing on air pollution, stress, and inflammatory biomarkers; 4) to acquire familiarity with additional climate-sensitive outcomes such as birth and mental health outcomes and mechanistic intermediaries. This career development plan will facilitate the candidate becoming a leading expert and independent investigator in children's environmental health and advance the NIH's mission to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Public Health Relevance: Climate change is estimated to result in over 200,000 premature deaths per year - over 80% of which are among children - and projected to cause additional health effects in the coming decades. Air pollution and psychosocial stress exposures, and the underlying immune mechanisms of maternal and child health are important climate-sensitive factors in this public health issue. This project aims to build the epidemiologic skills of a pediatrician dedicated to finding ways to reduce climate health impacts both within the USA and globally.","Prenatal Pollution, Stress and Maternal-child Health: Role of Immunomodulation",8898803,K23ES024127,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Allergens ', ' Award ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Boston ', ' Carbon Black ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Elements ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Environmental Health ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Gestational Age ', ' Fetal Age ', ' Chronologic Fetal Maturity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' Literature ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mothers ', ' New York ', ' Occupational or Industrial Medicine ', ' Industrial Medicine ', ' Occupational Medicine ', ' living system ', ' Organism ', ' Pediatrics ', ' Play ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' preventative medicine ', ' Preventive Medicine ', ' Psychiatry ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Postpartum ', ' Postpartum Period ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Immunology ', ' career ', ' Perinatal ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Postnatal Depression ', ' Post-Partum Depression ', ' Post-Natal Depression ', ' Postpartum Depression ', ' disability ', ' pediatrician ', ' Development Plans ', ' Maternal Exposure ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Environmental Medicine ', ' Pollution ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' fetal stress ', ' prenatal stress ', ' Particulate ', ' Neurocognitive ', ' respiratory ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' intergenerational ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' toxicant ', ' Familiarity ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' immunologic reactivity control ', ' immune modulation ', ' Immunomodulation ', ' immunoregulation ', ' novel ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' land use ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Environmental Epidemiology ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' Community Health ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Output ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' global climate change ', ' climate change ', ' thermo stress ', ' thermal stress ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' public health relevance ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIEHS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2015,164303,0.11497482463025833
"Interaction of Air Pollution and Psychosocial Stress on Cardiovascular Disease. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This proposal seeks to understand the interaction between air pollution and psychosocial stress on markers of inflammation and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). Under the mentorship of Dr. Joel Kaufman, this training and research plan will build upon Dr. Hajat's expertise in social epidemiology and prepare her for a career studying the nexus of social and environmental factors and their impact on CVD. During the K99 phase, Dr. Hajat will use didactic instruction and independent study to gain additional training in 1) the biology of stress and CVD 2) spatial statistical methods and 3) exposure generation and assessment. This training will provide Dr. Hajat with interdisciplinary skills and knowledge as she moves towards an independent research career. During the K99 phase Dr. Hajat will characterize the extent to which biomarkers of stress, neighborhood-level psychosocial stressors and individual level psychosocial stressors are spatially correlated with ambient air pollutants, specifically particulae matter <2.5 ¿m in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and black carbon. This work will build upon Dr. Hajat's previous work using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a longitudinal study of subclinical CVD in a cohort of older adults recruited from six metropolitan areas across the US. Upon completion of the training phase of this award, Dr. Hajat will undertake research during the R00 phase of the project that will transition her to an independent investigator. The aims of this research are (1) to assess the synergistic effects of air pollution and psychosocial stress (measured objectively and subjectively) on markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen) as well as on the progression of atherosclerosis in different vascular beds, measured by intima media thickness, coronary calcification and ankle brachial index and (2) to conduct a crossover study which exposes participants to both diesel exhaust (DE) from an inhalation facility and a laboratory-based mental stress test to assess the synergistic effect of both exposures on physiological outcomes such as blood pressure, heart rate variability, catecholamine levels and IL-6. The research in the R00 phase proposes epidemiologic studies of two complementary extant data sources, MESA and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional nationally representative sample of the US population. Both studies have data on air pollution, psychosocial stressors, inflammation and subclinical CVD and together capture a larger geographic area and populations across the life course. The R00 phase also proposes conducting an experimental study. The study will be conducted in one of the nation's few controlled inhalation facilities where subjects will be exposed to both DE and a laboratory generated acute mental stressor. The acute mental stress exposure, which is often used in psychology, will consist of administering a speech task and an arithmetic task. Understanding the synergistic effects of air pollution and psychosocial stress will help advance our understanding of the biological mechanisms behind environmental health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in rates of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the US, have been persistent for decades. New approaches to understanding the root causes of health disparities are needed if our nation wants to make progress towards alleviating these disparities and in so doing improving the public's health. This proposal will explore the joint effect of psychosocial stressors and an environmental hazard, air pollution, to better understand if together these factors contribute to precursors of cardiovascular disease.",Interaction of Air Pollution and Psychosocial Stress on Cardiovascular Disease.,8813573,K99ES023498,"['Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', '

"Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Black Americans carry a disproportionate burden of social risk factors for poor mental health, such as living in violent urban environments and experiencing economic deprivation and discrimination. Despite these risks, Black Americans have lower lifetime prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders than Whites. The reasons for Black Americans' resilience to these mental health disorders are unknown. This proposal aims to examine cumulative adversity and subsequent diminished neurobiological stress response as a possible explanation of Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and depression. It also aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this resilience. These aims will be accomplished by conducting research interviews with 1,306 young adults (age 20-21; 60% Black, 40% White; 50% female) from an existing community sample who have been previously assessed three times during childhood and adolescence. These research interviews will provide information on adversity experienced by the participants, categorical diagnoses and dimensional measures of internalizing distress, and physiological indicators of reactivity to stress. Neural bases of stress response will be evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for a subset of 120 Black and 120 White participants from the larger study. This study is innovative because it proposes to test a novel mechanism explaining the resilience of Black Americans to depression and anxiety, incorporates both categorical and dimensional measures of internalizing problems, and examines the role of physiological stress response and regulatory neural circuit in the resilience process. The results will have important implications for our understanding of racial disparities i anxiety and depression, neurobiological mechanisms underlying resilience to stress, and relationships between environmental stress, neural and physiological response, and negative affect. These findings will point to novel ways to diagnose and treat mental health problems in Black and White Americans. Black Americans are exposed to more adversity than White Americans, yet they experience lower rates of anxiety and depressive disorders. The proposed project investigates cumulative adversity and diminished neurobiological stress response as causal mechanisms underlying Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and mood disorders. The findings will improve our understanding of the role of adversity and neurobiological stress system in anxiety and depression and suggest novel approaches to diagnose and treat these mental health problems in Black and White Americans.",Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans,8875766,R01MH098348,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Electromyography ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Diagnostic ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Brain region ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' Prevalence ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2015,644946,0.05145127076230256
"NEURAL MECHANISMS IN WOMEN’S TREATMENT AND EARLY RECOVERY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychological stress is a causal factor in the pathogenesis of substance use disorder (SUD) and relapse risk. Low-income women report high levels of stress in SUD residential treatment stemming from significant economic and family stressors in addition to challenges adjusting to residential treatment demands. Unmanaged stress, especially in early stages of residential treatment, is a major concern because it can increase dropout. Dropout from residential treatment places women at risk of substance use relapse. A gap in knowledge persists regarding the use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) with racially and ethnically diverse low-income women with SUDs, especially regarding the efficacy of adapted MBIs for preventing residential dropout and decreasing relapse. The long-term goal of this application is to improve treatment outcomes in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women with SUDs by targeting stress, residential dropout, and relapse. We have fully adapted, developed, and pilot tested a novel MBI, Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery: Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention for Women (MBRP-W), that supports the needs of women in residential treatment. It showed promising results in substance use and perceived stress outcomes and no racial or ethnic differences in outcomes. This MBI integrates relapse prevention, addresses literacy level, and is relevant to issues surrounding treatment- and relapse-related stressors of disadvantaged women. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to test the efficacy of MBRP-W on residential treatment (a) retention and (b) substance use relapse in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women to determine; (2) the mechanisms of change underlying the MBRP-W program; and (3) if changes in hair cortisol as a marker of chronic stress provide a more powerful measure of stress compared to self- reported stress as a mechanism of change. A rationale for MBRP-W is the need for self-initiated stress management skills in women with SUDs during the early stressful periods of residential treatment that increase risk of dropout and relapse. The unique strengths of this application are its focus on underserved populations, residential dropout, and relapse outcomes, and the first-ever inclusion of a chronic stress biomarker in MBI research in the form of hair cortisol. The proposed work is innovative in that it intends to reduce stress in women to improve both retention and relapse outcomes. The expected results will define a viable integrative treatment that can improve stress management skills and treatment outcomes and will evaluate the utility of a biomarker of chronic stress. Results of this study will have a positive impact on substance use recovery outcomes in diverse groups of low-income women and identify mechanisms of action to inform future SUD treatment. The project's public health impact meets NIDA goals because it intends to prevent the escalation of addiction and its health consequences by offering a novel treatment accessible to undeserved women that is expected to decrease addiction-related racial and ethnic and gender-based health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 25 million Americans struggle with alcohol or drug problems annually. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is costly to our nation, exacting more than $428 billion in costs related to crime, lost work productivity and health care. While effective treatments exist, over half of those who enter treatment for substance use disorders drop out early in treatment and return to alcohol or drug abuse. The proposed research addresses this public health problem directly by testing an innovative approach to increasing treatment retention and reducing relapse among a diverse and underserved group of women.            ",NEURAL MECHANISMS IN WOMEN’S TREATMENT AND EARLY RECOVERY,8910210,R01DA038648,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Dropout ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' literacy ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Productivity ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Registries ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' using substances ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Recovery ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' meetings ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' cost ', ' dissemination research ', ' computerized ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based program ', ' early therapy ', ' Early treatment ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' trial comparing ', ' stem ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mindfulness ', ' efficacy testing ', ' distress tolerance ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2015,575997,0.031872274671982156
"Biomarkers of Health Risk Among African American Couples ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation (INF) predicts the onset of chronic, age-related diseases. Although psychosocial stress is a major determinant of INF, we know little about the role of stress contagion from romantic partners, a prominent social context in early adulthood, or the role of childhood stressors in amplifying INF response to adult stress. Evidence has accumulated indicating that early stress experiences may shift propensity to respond with INF due to early calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR). However, we have little information regarding the extent to which IRTR predicts amplified INF response to adult stressors or the extent which it accounts for the impact of early stressors on INF. In addition, we do not know the extent to which persistent, supportive relationships in young adulthood have the potential to ameliorate the impact of earlier stressors by modifying IRTR and so reducing INF in response to adult stressors. Finally, prior research has largely focused on White samples, thereby limiting our understanding of the causes of INF among African Americans, a group at elevated risk for age- related chronic illness. This application seeks funding to add assessment of romantic partners and to directly assess IRTR for both targets and partners who are participating in a recently funded application. In the parent application we assess INF and collect telephone interview data from targets regarding stress and health behaviors in a sample of roughly 700 African Americans (now 28 years of age). In the current application we add parallel interview assessments and assessment of INF for N = 320 romantic partners. In addition we add assessment of IRTR for both targets and romantic partners. This additional data collection will allow us to address the following specific aims: 1) Identify the effect of stress contagion on young adult INF among African Americans, controlling for own stressors and history of early exposure to stressors; 2) Test hypothesized amplification of effect on INF of own stress, stress contagion, and dyad-level effects due to exposure to early stressors, and examine the hypothesis that calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR) is the mechanism by which early stress influences INF; and 3) Test the hypothesized role of persistent supportive romantic relationships (PSR) in ""recalibrating"" stress biology, i.e., examine the hypothesis that among those in persistent supportive relationships in young adulthood we will see reduced impact of early stress exposure on IRTR. The Institute of Medicine prescribes development of prevention based on longitudinal, epidemiological research with target populations. Currently, no prospective investigations identify the protective factors that interrup the impact of stress on INF for African Americans. The results of the proposed research will identify protective processes and serve as the basis for empirically- based, health disparities prevention programs as well as provide a basis for ongoing policy discussions, e.g. the Healthy Marriage Initiative.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving quality of longer lives requires information about sources of the inflammation linked to age- related, chronic diseases; causes that include social relationships and may lie at earlier stages of development. Building on prior research documenting the role of childhood stress in amplifying inflammatory responses to adult stress, the present study examines the interaction of child stress with stress contagion from adult romantic partners as well as ameliorative effects due to persistent, supportive romantic relationships, and so provides a foundation for development of preventative interventions to protect against amplified inflammation and a framework for ongoing policy discussions such as the healthy marriage initiative.            ",Biomarkers of Health Risk Among African American Couples,8882653,R01HD080749,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Calibration ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' Marriage ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' psychosocial ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' stressor ', ' contagion ', ' Prevention program ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' healthy aging ', ' parent project ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2015,651579,0.20612964275731316
"Identity Stress and Health in Three Cohorts of LGB individuals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth and adults suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Minority stress theory suggests that because of prejudice and stigma in the social environment, LGB people experience excess stress that leads to poor health outcomes and health disparities. Because of its focus on the social environment, minority stress theory leads us to predict that the character of stress processes affecting LGBs shift along with improvement in the social environment. Similarly shifting are notions of LGB identity, connection with the community, and the types of social and health services LGB people seek. If we are to achieve the U.S. Public Health Services' goal of reducing health disparities related to sexual orientation, we need to understand the impact of changes in identity and minority stress on LGB health and, using this knowledge, inform public health interventions across the lifespan. To gain this knowledge, we propose a longitudinal study using a probability sample of diverse LGBs representative of LGBs in the U.S. population. We seek to compare 3 cohorts of LGB individuals-aged 18 - 25, 34 - 42, and 48 - 55 years old-who are distinct in that they were exposed to significantly different social environments when they came of age. We are interested in ways that identity and minority stress predict health across the cohorts. We will use a mixed method design that allows us to gain knowledge from both qualitative and survey data. We use an innovative 2-stage procedure to recruit a sample of 676 LGB individuals representative of U.S. Black, Latino, and White LGB populations. We assess respondents baseline and annually for 3 years thereafter. In a qualitative study, we use a narrative life history to assess a diverse group of Black, Latino, White, and Asian LGB individuals in urban and rural regions of New York, California, and Arizona. We hypothesize that: 1. Despite readily acknowledging an LGB identity and coming out at a younger age than did older cohorts, the younger cohorts differ from older cohorts in that their LGB identity is less central, they are less strongly identified with the LGB community, and have different meanings of sexual orientation and identity. 2. Compared with older, the younger cohort experience less minority stress related to their own acceptance of a gay identity and coming out, but more external stress, including prejudice-related stressful life events, antigay violence, and everyday forms of discrimination. 3.

"Setting a trajectory: biological markers of early stress and child development     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To identify at-risk children precise indicators of the biological changes associated with early life adversity, including prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and racial disparities are needed. Without reliable indicators capable of providing mechanistic insight the ability to design and implement innovative interventions, and alter negative developmental trajectories, remains limited. Alterations in the stress response system, determined by salivary cortisol levels, are associated with PNMS. Disrupted parent-child attachment, as well as the therapeutic repair of this relationship, has also been found to influence the cortisol response in infants. However, the stress hypo-responsive period in early childhood may limit the utility of cortisol as a stand-alone indicator during this critical developmental time point. Additionally, while cortisol indicates dysregulation in the HPA axis it provides minimal mechanistic information. The established role of genetic and epigenetic factors, including FKBP5 and miRNAs, to both the responsiveness and adaptation of the HPA axis suggest they play an important role in the underlying mechanism. Concurrent measurement of gene expression, miRNA, and cortisol is expected to more robustly define how early adversity is biological embedded. Saliva represents an ideal accessible biological source that reflects an individual's complex internal milieu. Recent evidence indicates that mRNA, miRNA and telomere length can be reliably measured in saliva. Studies have also demonstrated changes in each of these markers with exposure to early adversity and stress. These collective findings indicate that an epigenetic psychophysiological profile concurrently measuring each component is feasible and a critical next step in research seeking to chart the trajectory of mental illness and define the earliest intervention time points. This study expects to enroll infants of African American women with extensive characterization of PNMS and maternal preconception adversity. Saliva will be collected pre and post a known stressor designed to activate the HPA axis at two early developmental time points. Infants will be stressed before (4 months, using the Still Face Procedure) and after (12 months, using the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP)) the development of attachment. The cortisol response to the stressor, fold change in FKBP5 mRNA pre/post the stressor as well as initial levels of miR-134 and miR-16 and telomere length will be determined. Leveraging the increased statistical power associated with propensity score matching this proposal will test the association between PNMS, attachment and salivary markers while controlling for preconception adversity. Achievement of the proposal aims of this proposal is expected to provide enhanced biological evidence in support of the implementation of attachment based interventions early in the life course. The critical need to more effectively address persistent health disparities and decrease the negative health outcomes associated with toxic stress requires the development of innovative methodologies that both define biological mechanisms and track the effectiveness of interventions at the behavioral, physiologic, and molecular level.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because an enhanced mechanistic understanding of the biological embedding of early adversity is ultimately expected to lead to novel interventions and preventive efforts that alter the life-long negative health trajectories associated with toxic stress and health disparities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIMH's mission that pertains to strengthening the public health impact of NIMH funded research and to charting mental illness trajectories to determine when to intervene.",Setting a trajectory: biological markers of early stress and child development,8839304,R01MH101533,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' psychological disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Motion ', ' premRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health (U.S.) ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' FKBP Rotamase ', ' FKBP ', ' FK506 Binding Proteins ', ' FK-506-Binding Protein ', ' Tacrolimus Binding Proteins ', ' telomere ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Salivary ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' hypothalamic pituitary axis ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ', ' DSM ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Age-Months ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Security ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Secure ', ' ']",NIMH,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2015,731232,0.10772012518117609
"Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing racial disparity in obesity has reached a critical juncture, particularly among black and white females. Obesity is now being perpetuated across generations. While there is uncertainty about how best to prevent obesity and the related racial disparities, converging lines of evidence support the influence of stress on obesity. We hypothesize that income and race are associated with higher levels of both objective and perceived stress, which in turn are associated with higher rates of dysregulated eating, a behavior posited to result in an increased rate of obesity. Finally, we propose that stress has a direct effect on the level of obesity in the offspring. We propose to model these relationships longitudinally using the National Growth and Healthy Study (NGHS) that enrolled equal numbers of black and white girls and that contains extensive measures of life stress, nonhomeostatic eating, household demographic and socioeconomic indicators and cardiometabolic risk factors for black and white girls initially sampled at age 10 and interviewed annually until age 20. We will extend these data, adding a new wave of data collection for the women who are now 36 and their children. We will interview participants regarding their current levels of stress, household food insecurity, dysregulated eating behaviors such as dietary restraint and overeating, and collect data on dietary intake and physical activity. We will collect measured weight and central adiposity and clinical measures of metabolic syndrome on both the women and their children. Building on the rich source of longitudinal data that NGHS provides, we will model relationships between these factors and weight status from early childhood to adulthood among these women and their children in order to examine the effects of cumulative stress, eating behaviors and obesity on obesity in the next generation. The study aims to test the hypotheses that: 1) stress and dysregulated eating results in an increased rate of obesity, exacerbated by food insecurity; 2) maternal stress and dysregulated eating have a direct effect on the level of obesity and markers of metabolic syndrome in offspring; and, 3) race and income are associated with higher levels of stress and dysregulated eating in women. Our preliminary data suggests that stress leads to excessive weight gain ten years later in the NGHS cohort. We will identify predictors of weight gain trajectories from childhood to adulthood. These constructs have the potential to lead to promising interventions coupled with traditional diet and physical activity components that will help girls and women throughout the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing black/white disparities and the perpetuation of obesity across generations has reached a critical juncture, particularly among girls and women. The current proposal seeks to add a new wave of data collection to survey participants regarding current stress factors, household food insecurity, and non-homeostatic eating such as restrained and drive to overeat and evaluate the relationships between these factors and weight gain trajectories in a longitudinal cohort of girls followed from age 10 to 36 years. We believe that this approach will identify modifiable stress-based factors that can be incorporated into intervention trials leading to sustained changes in children's and women's weight trajectories.","Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity",8876752,R01HD073568,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Data Collection ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fat Body ', ' Female ', ' Food ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mothers ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Weights and Measures ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' Body Measures ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Body fat ', ' Life ', ' calorie (nutrition) ', ' Calories ', ' Source ', ' waist circumference ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' Coupled ', ' sixteen year old ', ' age 16 years ', ' 16 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 year old ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2015,517562,0.055760971475478135
"RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULTS' PATHWAYS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong African American Families Healthy Adult Project (SHAPE) followed 493 African American youth from ages 11 to 20. Participants have grown up in rural Georgia communities in which poverty rates for African Americans are among the highest in the nation. Life in rural areas can be more challenging than in urban areas due to restricted educational and employment opportunities, difficulties in obtaining physical and mental health care, and a lack of public transportation. Despite living in such challenging situations, many SHAPE participants have displayed high levels of psychosocial functioning across adolescence. We identified naturally occurring factors in family and community networks that protected these youth from the consequences of SES- and race-related stressors that proliferate in rural Southern contexts. Epidemiological research reveals that African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of chronic diseases of aging (CDA) such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence indicates that contemporaneous health determinants in midlife or later cannot adequately account for why rural African Americans experience high rates of CDAs. Rather, many CDAs incubate in physiological systems for decades prior to the manifestation of disease. In the next 5 years, SHAPE participants will experience a stressful developmental transition. Job turnover rates are high, and the combined effects of poor preparation for employment and discriminatory hiring practices make obtaining stable employment a protracted and often demoralizing process. These stressors have the potential to take a toll on SHAPE participants' health, undermining psychosocial functioning and contributing to CDA-related vulnerabilities. To understand the pathways from stress exposure during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood to CDA vulnerabilities and psychosocial outcomes, we propose to extend the SHAPE research program in two key ways. First we propose to augment our health assessment of SHAPE participants to include markers of metabolic syndrome and pro-inflammatory tendencies which are linked to the development of CDAs. Second, we propose to investigate a critical question for public health scientists and practitioners. In response to stress exposure, some SHAPE participants will evince escalation in CDA vulnerability whereas other will not. This proposal is designed to investigate why. Evidence from laboratory-based studies suggests a central role for psychosocial risk and protective mechanisms in young adulthood and earlier phases of development in altering the pathways linking stress exposure and CDA precursors. Prospective research investigating these risk and protective mechanisms, however, is virtually nonexistent. We thus propose to collect data from SHAPE participants, at ages 22 and 24 years, that includes CDA precursors along with assessments of environmental stressors, psychosocial adjustment, risk and protective mechanisms, HPA axis/SNS deregulation, and health behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of health disparities. Recent research suggests that the roots of these disparities lie in earlier stages of development as young people cope with stressful environments.

"Stress & Parenting in Blacks: Preventing Obesity in Youth to Reduce Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity was a factor in over 16,000 cancer-related deaths in African-Americans (Blacks) in 2011. Blacks have the highest prevalence of obesity and cancer death rates of any group in the United States. Obesity and lifestyle behaviors related to increased cancer risks are often established during childhood, highlighting the importance of parenting behaviors in reducing obesity-related cancer risks. The proposed study examines the influence of coping in mitigating the effects of stress on caregiver behaviors that promote child obesity, fast food, fruit and vegetable consumption, activity and inactivity. The long term research objective is to develop an intervention for Black families to reduce obesity-related cancer risk in children. Stress, defined as the negative psychological response to events that are perceived as taxing, in Black adults is associated with haphazard meal planning and increased consumption of high-fat/high-sugar foods. Stress in parents/caregivers (here on referred to as ""caregivers"") is associated with child obesity, fast food consumption, and decreased vegetable intake. Differential use of coping styles in Blacks and Whites has been postulated as a cause for health disparities. There is evidence that compared with Whites, Blacks are more likely to use religious and culturally influenced coping. Both of these types of coping have aspects that either increase the risk of obesity (negative coping) or decrease the risk of obesity (positive coping). A mixed-methods design will be used to identify how stress and coping influence parenting behaviors that may be associated with child obesity. The research aims are: (1) to characterize the relationships among stress, coping skills and parenting behaviors of Black caregivers that promote child obesity; and (2) to measure the association of stress and culturally-influenced and religious coping styles with parenting behaviors of Black caregivers that promote child obesity. To accomplish these aims, first a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews will be used to characterize the influence of stress and coping on parenting related to child obesity in 48 caregivers of children ages 3-7 years. Second, a cross-sectional study will measure these relationships in 164 caregivers and their children ages 3-7 years. This study will be conducted in the Black church community to reflect the fact that 85% of Blacks consider themselves a part of Black church culture. These studies will inform future projects that develop and test interventions to prevent child obesity and future cancer risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African-Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with and suffer greater complications from cancer, often as a result of obesity, decreased physical activity  and poor nutrition. These behaviors that increase the risk of cancer often begin in childhood under the influence of parents. The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of how stress and coping in African-American parents influence the physical activity and nutrition environments of their children, in order to gain insights about potential ways to prevent childhood obesity and the future development of cancer.",Stress & Parenting in Blacks: Preventing Obesity in Youth to Reduce Cancer Risk,8853175,K01CA160818,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Interview ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Vegetables ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' Frequency ', ' Frequencies (time pattern) ', ' Event ', ' Church ', ' cancer complication ', ' cancer risk ', ' self reliance ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Reporting ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' parent influence ', ' parental influence ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' food consumption ', ' feeding ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Obesity related cancer ', ' Obesity associated cancer ', ' coping ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Consumption ', ' obesity risk ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' ']",NCI,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K01,2015,130860,0.0584506923796933
"Stress and Unintended Pregnancy in Adolescence and Young Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent and young adult women in the U.S., especially racial/ethnic minority and poor young women, have high rates of early and unintended pregnancy, which are associated with a host of adverse outcomes. While proximal and distal determinants of fertility have been widely studied, little research has focused on the role of stress in unintended pregnancy.  Stress is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality and a key mechanism that links social context and health disparities. The biological and psychological processes of stress may affect the pathways to unintended pregnancy, but this has not been addressed in reproductive health research. Moreover, how social determinants of stress shape young women's risk of unintended pregnancy is unknown. To improve our knowledge of the complex, interrelated determinants of unintended pregnancy and to advance reproductive health scholarship at the intersection of biological and social processes (i.e. biosocial), this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award focuses on the important but understudied role of stress in unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood. So that I may conduct cutting-edge research in this area, I propose career development training to: 1) learn sociological theories, concepts, and methods for studying unintended pregnancy and stress; 2) build competency in bio demographic research methods and their application to fertility research; 3) attain a more nuanced understanding of the theory and research on the biology of stress and fecund ability; and 4) become proficient in advanced multilevel, longitudinal, and mediational statistical methods required for modeling the life course of and pathways between stress and unintended pregnancy. The corresponding K01 research project will: 1) estimate how trajectories of stress relate to unintended pregnancy; 2) investigate relationships between social determinants of stress (social stressors), stress trajectories, and unintended pregnancy; and 3) explore the biological processes (e.g., neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and immune) through which stress influences unintended pregnancy, during adolescence and young adulthood. To assist with the K01 training and research plans, I have assembled a strong multidisciplinary advisory board comprised of esteemed scholars, including mentor Jennifer Barber PhD, co-mentor Kathleen Mullan Harris PhD, scientific advisors Ana Diez Roux MD PhD, Timothy Johnson MD, and Julia Seng PhD MSN, and statistical consultant Yu Xie PhD. The University of Michigan Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Institute for Social Research and The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health and Carolina Population Center will provide the infrastructures to support these activities. This K01 will establish me as an independent investigator poised to conduct new biosocial studies of fertility and ultimately lead innovative, interdisciplinary research efforts to improve outcomes an reduce disparities in young women's reproductive health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood is a persistent public health problem with negative implications for young women, their offspring, and society. Stress, which is prevalent across the reproductive life course and is a contributor to morbidity, mortality, and health disparities, has been understudied in reproductive health research. Using an innovative, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary approach, this study will provide new insights into the biosocial processes of stress that shape the risk of unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood, and findings will help identify reproductive health services, programs, and policies to improve reproductive outcomes and reduce disparities among young women.            ",Stress and Unintended Pregnancy in Adolescence and Young Adulthood,8873324,K01HD080722,"['Miscarriage ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biology ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Gynecology ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"The Intergenerational Transmission of Race Disparities in Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): I am seeking a K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in Population Research to achieve the following career goals: 1) to apply my interdisciplinary biodemographic training and emphasis in the underlying biological mechanisms mediating social inequality, stress, and health to studying black-white differences in health outcomes, 2) identify race differences in the persistence and pathways of manifested health disparities, and 3) to initiate interdisciplinary dialogue and program development for training scholars in the social and biological interactions that contribute to disparate health outcomes. My prior training and research in family, mental health, and social inequality, along with my excellent quantitative methodological skills, provide a strong interdisciplinary foundation. A K01 would expand on this groundwork by integrating groundbreaking biodemographic perspectives and techniques measuring how social inequality 'gets under the skin' to make people sick. The proposed training in understanding the biology of stress integrates training with non-human primate and human models, under the supervision of my exceptional mentors and advisory committee. This novel training will place me in a unique position to contribute to an interdisciplinary community of scholars and policy makers regarding the mechanisms through which inequality contributes to health declines in vulnerable populations. My mentors, biodemographer Mark Hayward and medical sociologist Les Whitbeck, will supervise my training and scholarly development. The research plan incorporates coursework in biodemography, psychobiology, and neurobiology, endocrinology, and research methods in human biology. This integrative curricula will be applied to several complementary aspects of the project including implementing 1) a biomarker pilot study on social stressors and biological measures of stress and health in white and black mothers and their offspring, and secondary data analysis 2) examining black-white differences in the pathways of early life course illness onset using the Add-Health, PSID, and NLSY, and 3) the degree to which there are race differences in the intergenerational persistence of disparate health outcomes using the PSID and NLSY. Overall this award will allow me to 1) gain expertise in biodemographic methods and the biology of stress and illness, 2) the protected time needed to complete my research plan applying theory and methodology, 3) to present my results at conferences and publish results in peer reviewed journals and 4) to prepare an innovative R01 grant proposal to initiate my career as an independent scholar. This award will establish me as an independent investigator in biodemography with the knowledge and skills to communicate across disciplines about the etiology of race differences in health and strategies we may use to alleviate such differences.       Project Narrative Black-white differences in health outcomes have increased over the last 50 years in the U.S. with blacks being at higher risk of morbidity and mortality. While differences have been described, less is known about 1) the underlying biological processes that contribute to these population based health differences, 2) the contribution of early life course social factors associated with such disparities, and 3) black-white differences in the persistence of these differences across generations.

"Identity Stress and Health in Three Cohorts of LGB individuals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth and adults suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Minority stress theory suggests that because of prejudice and stigma in the social environment, LGB people experience excess stress that leads to poor health outcomes and health disparities. Because of its focus on the social environment, minority stress theory leads us to predict that the character of stress processes affecting LGBs shift along with improvement in the social environment. Similarly shifting are notions of LGB identity, connection with the community, and the types of social and health services LGB people seek. If we are to achieve the U.S. Public Health Services' goal of reducing health disparities related to sexual orientation, we need to understand the impact of changes in identity and minority stress on LGB health and, using this knowledge, inform public health interventions across the lifespan. To gain this knowledge, we propose a longitudinal study using a probability sample of diverse LGBs representative of LGBs in the U.S. population. We seek to compare 3 cohorts of LGB individuals-aged 18 - 25, 34 - 42, and 48 - 55 years old-who are distinct in that they were exposed to significantly different social environments when they came of age. We are interested in ways that identity and minority stress predict health across the cohorts. We will use a mixed method design that allows us to gain knowledge from both qualitative and survey data. We use an innovative 2-stage procedure to recruit a sample of 676 LGB individuals representative of U.S. Black, Latino, and White LGB populations. We assess respondents baseline and annually for 3 years thereafter. In a qualitative study, we use a narrative life history to assess a diverse group of Black, Latino, White, and Asian LGB individuals in urban and rural regions of New York, California, and Arizona. We hypothesize that: 1. Despite readily acknowledging an LGB identity and coming out at a younger age than did older cohorts, the younger cohorts differ from older cohorts in that their LGB identity is less central, they are less strongly identified with the LGB community, and have different meanings of sexual orientation and identity. 2. Compared with older, the younger cohort experience less minority stress related to their own acceptance of a gay identity and coming out, but more external stress, including prejudice-related stressful life events, antigay violence, and everyday forms of discrimination. 3. Members of younger LGB cohorts utilize fewer LGB-identified social and health services than do members of older LGB cohorts. 4. In structural equations, the minority stress model functions equally well in predicting health outcomes in the younger and older cohorts, but patterns of stress, resilience, and health outcomes differ among the cohorts in accordance with findings in Aims 1 and 2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth continue to suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Social changes have significantly altered the developmental trajectories of today's LGB youth, requiring that we reexamine our knowledge of stress and health in this population.

"Exploring Stress,Aging and Health Among Parents of Sexual Minorities     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Institute of Medicine recently issued a report on ""The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People"" (2011), which was followed by a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) from The National Institutes of Health regarding ""Research on the Health of LGBTI Populations."" This FOA highlights the need for research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and related populations. The proposed study seeks to examine stress, aging, and health among midlife and older parents of adult lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons (LGBs), an under-studied population that is likely to encounter unique social stressors associated with the sexual minority status of their daughters and sons. We hypothesize that the health of these parents is significantly influenced by the sexual minority stress experiences of their children via the process of stress proliferation. We additionally posit that these stressors may influence the occurrence and/or impact of other stressors, and stress moderators, including specifically parental ambivalence. If this is the case, millions of American parents are at risk for sexual minority stress-related insults to their health. Previous research has documented health disparities between sexual minorities and heterosexuals, but whether these disparities extend to their parents is unknown because these parents are largely invisible and, therefore, existing studies have relied on convenience samples, severely limiting the generalizability of findings. The often rancorous sociopolitical climate in the U.S. regarding LGB civil rights compounds the situation because sexual minority issues are no longer ""closeted"" and are an open part of public discourse, to the satisfaction of some parents and the displeasure of others. We propose a study of stress processes affecting parents of adult LGBs using a nationally representative sample and based on an original LGB Parental Stress Model. Testing our innovative model will set the stage for a subsequent R01 study on parents of LGBs that will conceptually re-orient how we view their roles at the individual, familial, and societal levels. Ou specific aims are to: 1) Develop and pilot test a survey (English/Spanish) that assesses: (a) generic parental stress among self-identified parents of adult LGBs and parents without adult LGB children; (b) parental ambivalence for both groups; (c) sexual minority stress specifically among parents of LGBs; and (d) other pertinent stress domains; 2) Field this survey with a randomly drawn sample of 500 parents of adult LGBs from a nationally representative panel of U.S. adults and a comparison sample of 500 parents without LGB children; 3) Test the extent to which within-group variation in health among parents of LGBs is uniquely explained by sexual minority stress and interactions with parental ambivalence, age/cohort, and aging-related stress; 4) Ascertain whether there are health differences between the two groups of parents, and if so, the extent to which these differences can be attributed to heightened parental ambivalence and/or sexual minority stress among parents of LGBs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine recently issued a report that highlights health disparities between sexual minorities and heterosexuals and emphasizes how stigma, discrimination, internalized homophobia, and the need to conceal one's sexual orientation are widespread forms of sexual minority stress that are harmful to the health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons (LGBs). Surprisingly little is known about the millions of parents of LGBs, however, and population-based research on the health consequences of sexual minority stress ""contagion"" among these parents is nonexistent. The proposed study uses a nationally representative sample to explore sexual minority stress and health among midlife and older parents of adult LGBs, creating a model approach for subsequent stress and health research on these parents who are now growing older in the context of having traversed a historical era of tremendous personal, familial, and societal change regarding LGBs.                ","Exploring Stress,Aging and Health Among Parents of Sexual Minorities",8824232,R21AG047361,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Attitude ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Civil Rights ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Daughter ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' positive attitude ', ' Happiness ', ' Health ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Learning ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Shame ', ' Son ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' contagion ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' displeasure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' field survey ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia  ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBTI ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2015,231000,0.07014025412260985
"Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child Biology and Behavior DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable evidence documenting the effects of prenatal maternal stress and emotions on birth and early child outcomes, the biological pathways by which maternal stress is transferred to children are not yet well understood. The proposed study will test a set of novel hypotheses about maternal stress and allostatic load (physiological dysregulation across multiple systems due to cumulative wear-and-tear associated with chronic and acute stress exposure) during the preconception and prenatal periods. The study focuses primarily on HPA axis regulatory mechanisms in a sample of 201 diverse mother-child pairs, particularly the prediction of child neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress regulation at ages 2 and 3 and cellular aging (indexed by telomere length) in both young children and their mothers. Our inclusion of the preconception period is innovative and yields a more comprehensive understanding of developmental origins (including fetal programming) of later health and developmental competence. One overall objective is to identify modifiable risk factors that can be targeted for early effective prevention of adverse health, neurocognitive, and behavioral outcomes throughout the lifespan.  Participants will be recruited from an enrolled cohort of ethnically diverse, mostly low-income women in Washington, DC and Lake County, IL near Chicago as part of a large multi-site NIH collaborative study (Child Community Health Network Study; CCHN). The parent study includes extensive interview measures of maternal stress in preconception and pregnancy and maternal biomarkers that pose risk for disease in the next generation, creating a unique opportunity to examine prospective predictors of child outcomes. The specific aims are to examine effects of maternal stress and allostatic load, especially HPA regulation during preconception and in pregnancy on outcomes at ages 2 and 3. The outcomes are: (1) children's cortisol responses to acute laboratory stressors and circadian regulation of cortisol production; (2) children's fearful or anxious temperament measured by innovative observational laboratory testing; (3) children's neurocognitive functioning using standardized assessments; (4) children's leukocyte telomere length at age 2 and rates of shortening from ages 2 to 3. We will also examine leukocyte telomere length of mothers as a function of stress and test for mother-child associations.  RELEVANCE: This study addresses an NICHD research priority in 2011 to identify developmental origins of susceptibility to later health, disease, and longevity. Results will provide the first evidence about plausible biological pathways prior to pregnancy that, in turn, program prenatal and postnatal development, taking into consideration many other known environmental and biological influences. The findings have the potential to yield new understanding about the pervasive, serious maternal and child health disparities that extend throughout the lifespan and disproportionately impact low income, minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adult diseases with developmental origins including neurocognitive disorders are estimated to take an immense toll on our nation's health. The proposed research will prospectively investigate whether maternal factors in the preconception period and in pregnancy, especially stress and HPA regulatory mechanisms, alter the behavioral, stress regulatory and neurocognitive outcomes of young children, as well as effects on cellular aging processes in mother-child pairs. Findings will provide a new foundation for developing potentially powerful preventive interventions to improve children's lifelong well-being.",Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child Biology and Behavior,8846635,R01HD072021,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals and social stress on perinatal outcomes Project Summary/Abstract The goal of my K99/R00 career development plan is to launch an independent research program in reproductive and environmental epidemiology of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which includes evaluating social determinants of health that may affect overlapping biologic pathways. To accomplish this goal, I will enhance my expertise in environmental health sciences with didactic and hands-on training in reproductive biology, social epidemiology/stress science, and environmental epidemiologic methods. This specialized training will allow me to achieve my long term goal of becoming an independent academic investigator and offering new insights on the cumulative impacts of environmental and social factors on reproductive health.  The primary goal of my research plan is to evaluate the independent effects of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and psychosocial stress on thyroid hormone disruption and consequent perinatal outcomes among a population of socioeconomically and racially diverse pregnant women. This work is particularly innovative as both PBDEs and psychosocial stress can impact the thyroid system, suggesting a biologic plausibility for interaction, however the two exposures have never been examined simultaneously in a human study. During the K99 mentored phase, under the primary mentorship of Dr. Tracey Woodruff, I will use innovative measures to characterize biologically-relevant exposures to PBDEs and psychosocial stress and their effects on thyroid hormone disruption. Exposure to PBDEs will be assessed using both PBDE congeners as well as their hydroxylated metabolites (OH-PBDEs). Psychosocial stress will be evaluated with subjective measures of stress and telomere length, a biomarker of cellular aging that is influenced by psychosocial stress. In the independent phase, I will apply this knowledge to investigate the independent effects of PBDEs and psychosocial stress on adverse perinatal outcomes, such as gestational hypertension, preterm birth, and low birth weight, and assess whether these effects are mediated via the thyroid system. The integration of this work will enable me to develop the necessary methodological and biological frameworks to examine the combined, and potentially synergistic, effects of environmental and psychosocial factors on perinatal outcomes in future R01 studies. I am well positioned to accomplish these goals at the University of California, San Francisco, a highly respected research institution, with a strong environmental reproductive health program, a world-renowned faculty with expertise in psychosocial stress, and an extensive biomedical infrastructure. My primary mentor and co-mentors in reproductive sciences, environmental epidemiology, health disparities, stress science, and biostatistics will guide the process whereby I learn the methods that are required to accomplish the goals set forth in this proposal. This project represents the cutting-edge of health disparities and environmental health research and seeks to answer critical scientific as well as policy-relevant questions for improving the health of vulnerable populations who often face disproportionate and elevated exposures to multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors. Project Narrative The goal of this project is to prepare Dr. Ami Zota to transition to a position as an independent academic investigator in environmental health sciences focusing on the consequence of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy and social factors that may affect overlapping biologic pathways. She will conduct epidemiologic analyses to investigate the effects of polybrominated diphenyl ether (PBDE) flame retardants and psychosocial stress on perinatal outcomes and assess whether these effects are mediated by the thyroid system. Results from this work will improve pregnancy outcomes and inform public health policy, particularly for vulnerable subpopulations, who often encounter elevated exposures to chemical and non-chemical

"Longitudinal Perspectives on Race and Health in MIDUS: Insights from Milwaukee     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The MIDUS (Midlife in the U.S.) national longitudinal study included, at its second wave, a sample of African American adults from Milwaukee, WI, a high segregated U.S. city, to increase participation of minority respondents in clinic-based biological assessments. Numerous advances have been generated on the impact of psychosocial stress, including perceived discrimination, on health, well-being, and physiological risk factors. This revised application requests funds to conduct a longitudinal follow-up 9-10 years later on the Milwaukee sample to parallel longitudinal work currently underway on the main MIDUS sample. We hypothesize that Milwaukee African Americans compared to their White counterparts in MIDUS will show earlier age-related decline in health (chronic conditions, health symptoms, biological risk factors), health behaviors (physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol use) and cognitive capacities. Further we predict that race differences in longitudinal aging will be accounted for by differential environmental exposures (work/family stress, perceived discrimination) as well as more adverse experiences related to the economic recession. Exploiting the rich psychosocial assessments in MIDUS, we will investigate factors that moderate the impact of stress exposures on health. Such analyses will include vulnerability factors such as psychological distress (depression, anxiety, anger) hypothesized to exacerbate the adverse impact of environmental stress on health as well as resilience factors such as psychosocial strengths (purpose in life, sense of control, optimism, social ties) hypothesized to mitigate against such pernicious effects. The revised proposed distills the innovative features of the proposed research and offers novel analytic strategies to test key hypotheses.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing evidence suggests that age-related changes in health differ notably by such factors as income, educational status and race. This research will examine stress exposures in African Americans in the most segregated city in the U.S.: Milwaukee, WI, and compare them to Whites of similar economic and educational backgrounds. A key focus is on identifying factors that mitigate against poor health profiles in such contexts o adversity, so as to advance knowledge of protective resources that need to be more widely nurtured and promoted.            ",Longitudinal Perspectives on Race and Health in MIDUS: Insights from Milwaukee,8814956,R01AG047154,"['Episodic memory ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Cognitive ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Self-Administered ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' computerized ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Anxiety ', ' Archives ', ' Budgets ', ' Buffers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Economic Recession ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' Malaise ', ' insight ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Clinic ', ' psychosocial ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2015,400000,0.11172984746094627
"Improving maternal and child health through prenatal fatty acid supplementation: A randomized controlled study in African American women living in low-income urban environments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnant women living in poverty often experience chronic stress and consequently higher levels of stress hormones. In utero exposure to high levels of stress hormones can negatively affect the developing fetus and the infant's capacity for emotion and behavioral regulation. In this application we describe a developing program of research designed to reduce the negative impact of prenatal stress on infant health and development via nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy. DHA is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member of the omega-3 fatty acid family. DHA is found in its highest concentrations in neural cell membranes, affecting receptor function, neurotransmitter uptake, and signal transmission. There is growing evidence that low levels of dietary DHA intake are associated with suboptimal response to stress and that DHA supplementation can modulate stress response. Aims: The goals of the proposed study are to test whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy is associated with 1) improved maternal health during pregnancy among African American women living in urban poverty; 2) improved infant birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and 3) whether the association between DHA supplementation during pregnancy and infant outcomes is partially mediated by reductions in maternal perceived stress and stress reactivity during pregnancy. Approach: One hundred sixty-two pregnant African American women living in urban poverty, who consume less than two servings of fish per week, will be randomly assigned to receive 450 mg/daily of DHA or placebo beginning at 9-12 weeks of gestation through the end of pregnancy. Perceived stress, stressful life events, anxiety, and depression, inflammatory markers, DHA levels and response to a laboratory stressor will be assessed at baseline and at 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes (e.g., gestational age, birth weight, delivery complications) will be collected from medical records, and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress reactivity will be assessed at 1, 4 and 9 months of age. Investigators: This application builds on a recently completed NICHD/NIMH funded R21 (PI: Keenan), which yielded preliminary evidence that DHA supplementation during pregnancy reduces perceived stress and cortisol response to stress in pregnant African American women living in low-income, urban environments. Drs. Keenan and Hipwell and Ms. Wroblewksi were investigators on the R21 and will continue to work together on the proposed study. Dr. Della Torre is an Assistant Professor of Obstetrics at the University of Chicago, who specializes in providing clinical services to African American women living in the south side of Chicago. Innovation: This will be the first large randomized controlled study of the effect of DHA supplementation in pregnant African American women living in urban poverty on maternal and infant health and stress response. Impact: If DHA supplementation is associated with reductions in perceived stress, more modulated maternal cortisol response to stress, and more optimal emotional and behavioral regulation in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program of research on the mechanisms by which these associations evolve can be launched and broad-based prevention interventions that target maternal and child in vulnerable populations can be implemented, potentially leading to reductions health disparities in the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of the effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in pregnant women living in urban, low-income environments on stress regulation during pregnancy. If essential fatty acid supplementation is associated with reductions in the experience of stress, more modulated biological response to stress, and more optimal stress regulation and neurodevelopment in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program on the mechanisms by which nutrition reduces the negative impact on prenatal stress on the offspring can be launched. This study may be the first step toward broad-based prevention of suboptimal birth and developmental outcomes among children born to African American women living in poverty.            ",Improving

"Chronic Stress as a Pathway to Health Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socio-economic status (SES) produces wide disparities in health. These disparities are a problem because they describe increased risk for chronic diseases and early death for lower SES individuals and large costs to the U.S. economy due to health care and lost productivity. The long-term goal is to better understand the pathways by which lower SES results in worse health. The overall objective in this R03 is to test chronic stress as an explanation of SES-related health disparities. In contrast to previous daily stress studies, this R03 uses data from an economically and racially diverse sample of adults and has fine-grained data regarding the timing of stressors. The central hypothesis, drawn from several health disparity theories, is that lower SES individuals experience persistent exposure and prolonged response to stressors and that this frequent and extended activation of emotional responses results in physical wear-and-tear and eventual disease. The rationale for the proposed research is that by understanding the pathways by which SES-related stress reduces physical health, interventions can be developed to reduce physical symptoms on a daily basis and delay or prevent disease over the long-term. Guided by preliminary work, this chronic stress hypothesis will be tested on short- and long-time scales. Specific aims extended from this hypothesis include: 1) Test the prediction that, over the short-term, low SES will be associated with more frequent daily stressors and emotional responses to stressors which are larger in magnitude and duration, 2) Test the prediction that, on a daily basis, having emotional responses to daily stressors which are larger magnitude and longer duration predicts experiencing more frequent and severe physical symptoms on a daily basis, and 3) Test the prediction that, over a lifetime, low SES in childhood predicts worse physical health in adulthood because of more exposure to stressors and reduced psychosocial resources with which to respond to them. Under the first aim, magnitude of emotional reactivity will be distinguished from duration of emotional recovery - which the applicant has demonstrated is feasible in her preliminary work. Under the second aim, these magnitude and duration slopes of emotional responses to stressors across the day will be used to predict end of day physical symptoms. In the third aim, childhood and lifetime stress will be tested as mediators of the effects of objectiv indices of childhood SES on adult health. The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it tests theory-based predictions for health disparities, leverages a diverse sample, and approaches the predictions at multiple time scales. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of how SES disadvantage results in wide disparities in health. Such knowledge has the potential to direct interventions to the chronic stress pathways most predictive of daily and long-term health.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of the paths by which chronic stress results in worse day-to-day and long-term health is expected to increase understanding of socio- economic status related health disparities. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to protect health. It direct aligns with the U.S. Health and Human Services' Healthy People 2020 initiative of eliminating health disparities.            ",Chronic Stress as a Pathway to Health Disparities,8949993,R03AG050798,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Buffers ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' Personality ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Coronary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' daily functioning ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' demographics ', ' public health relevance ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R03,2015,74750,0.10605174397403752
"Physiology of Coping in Rural Low-income Preadolescents: An Experimental Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Physical and mental health disparities stemming from socioeconomic inequality and poverty are well documented (Evans, Wolf & Adler, 2012). There is clear evidence that (a) the groundwork for lifelong disease and premature death is laid during childhood (e.g., Chen & Miller, 2012), and (b) damage to and deregulation of the physiologic stress response is one of the most powerful mechanisms of the effects of poverty and economic inequality on illness and disease (e.g., Evans & Kim, 2012). To contribute solutions to health disparities, we need interventions that affect the physiologic systems that confer the risk. Since the stress response systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis/HPA and sympathetic-adrenomedullary/SAM) are a central mechanism for SES-based disparities, these are critical systems to target. Improving children's ability to cope with stress and regulate their reactivity has the potential to break the cycle of damage, but only if the coping strategies and regulatory processes that we target have effects at the physiologic level-we have preliminary findings suggesting that they do. The proposed project seeks to firmly establish this connection.  Preadolescence is a crucial time during which children's ability to recognize stress and its causes matures, and repertoires for coping with stress grow in both size and complexity. Preadolescents are, therefore, at a ripe stage to both inform our basic science questions and benefit from future coping-based prevention. Our team has compiled a basic understanding of the efficacious and inefficacious forms of coping used by children and adolescents exposed to poverty-related stress (e.g., Santiago, Wadsworth et al., 2011; Wadsworth & Compas, 2002; Wadsworth & Santiago, 2008, 2009), and we have discovered that living with poverty-related stress constrains the development of and/or ability to utilize efficacious coping (Santiago, Etter et al., 2011; Wadsworth et al., 2011). We do not yet know whether coping that is efficacious at the behavioral level has concomitant effects on the underlying physiologic stress response systems in poor, rural preadolescents. The current project will use an experimental approach and data from multiple levels of analysis, including measures of both HPA and SAM activity, observational coding of in vivo coping, and experimental manipulation of coping to: (a) compare the physiologic downregulation of randomly assigned in vivo efficacious (secondary control) and ineffective (disengagement) coping in low-income preadolescents, (b) examine how preadolescents' typical strategies for coping moderate their ability to either make use of secondary control strategies or to regulate themselves despite being primed for avoidance, (c) identify subgroups of preadolescents with different reactivity and regulation profiles, and (d) examine the individual and family characteristics of the identified subgroups, including who is more and less successful in each condition-potentially identifying person-specific intervention targets. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system can offer new directions for combatting health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Socioeconomic-based disparities in physical and mental health problems are large, persistent, and severe; begin during childhood; and stem from damage to physiologic stress response systems caused by chronic stress. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system may offer new directions for combatting health disparities. This project will use an experimental approach to examine the ability of different types of coping to have direct effects on low-income preadolescents' physiologic stress responses systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic-adrenomedullary system).",Physiology of Coping in Rural Low-income Preadolescents: An Experimental Approach,8890172,R21HD078753,"['Affect ', ' α-amylase ', ' glycogenase ', ' alpha-1,4-D-Glucanglucanohydrolase ', ' 1,4-alpha-D-Glucan glucanohydrolase ', ' alpha-amylase ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Cues ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' indexing ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Solutions ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Inequality ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Wolves ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Route ', ' Pattern ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' meetings ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' preteen ', ' preadolescence ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' distraction ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Population Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Instruction ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' Trier Social Stress Test ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' stem ', ' combat ', ' ']",NICHD,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R21,2015,174075,0.13815084107976539
"Identity Stress and Health in Three Cohorts of LGB individuals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth and adults suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Minority stress theory suggests that because of prejudice and stigma in the social environment, LGB people experience excess stress that leads to poor health outcomes and health disparities. Because of its focus on the social environment, minority stress theory leads us to predict that the character of stress processes affecting LGBs shift along with improvement in the social environment. Similarly shifting are notions of LGB identity, connection with the community, and the types of social and health services LGB people seek. If we are to achieve the U.S. Public Health Services' goal of reducing health disparities related to sexual orientation, we need to understand the impact of changes in identity and minority stress on LGB health and, using this knowledge, inform public health interventions across the lifespan. To gain this knowledge, we propose a longitudinal study using a probability sample of diverse LGBs representative of LGBs in the U.S. population. We seek to compare 3 cohorts of LGB individuals-aged 18 - 25, 34 - 42, and 48 - 55 years old-who are distinct in that they were exposed to significantly different social environments when they came of age. We are interested in ways that identity and minority stress predict health across the cohorts. We will use a mixed method design that allows us to gain knowledge from both qualitative and survey data. We use an innovative 2-stage procedure to recruit a sample of 676 LGB individuals representative of U.S. Black, Latino, and White LGB populations. We assess respondents baseline and annually for 3 years thereafter. In a qualitative study, we use a narrative life history to assess a diverse group of Black, Latino, White, and Asian LGB individuals in urban and rural regions of New York, California, and Arizona. We hypothesize that: 1. Despite readily acknowledging an LGB identity and coming out at a younger age than did older cohorts, the younger cohorts differ from older cohorts in that their LGB identity is less central, they are less strongly identified with the LGB community, and have different meanings of sexual orientation and identity. 2. Compared with older, the younger cohort experience less minority stress related to their own acceptance of a gay identity and coming out, but more external stress, including prejudice-related stressful life events, antigay violence, and everyday forms of discrimination. 3. Members of younger LGB cohorts utilize fewer LGB-identified social and health services than do members of older LGB cohorts. 4. In structural equations, the minority stress model functions equally well in predicting health outcomes in the younger and older cohorts, but patterns of stress, resilience, and health outcomes differ among the cohorts in accordance with findings in Aims 1 and 2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth continue to suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Social changes have significantly altered the developmental trajectories of today's LGB youth, requiring that we reexamine our knowledge of stress and health in this population.

"Sex Gender Differences in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Females are twice as likely as males to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and/or severe PTSD symptoms (PTS) following trauma exposure. Evidence suggests that this disparity may, in part, have a biological basis: trauma exposure can be biologically embedded via acquired epigenetic alterations that affect stress reactivity to even mild future stressors. Thus, sex differences in PTSD/PTS may be mediated, in part, by acquired epigenetic modifications. The long-term goal of the planned line of research is to contribute to the development of strategies to reduce sex/gender inequities associated with PTSD. The immediate objective of the proposed multidisciplinary pilot study is to collect information needed to design a full-scale R01 investigation of factors that might underlie observed sex/gender differences in PTSD/PTS.  The planned R21 study would leverage the infrastructure and resources of an ongoing R01 investigation to obtain epigenetic information on a subgroup at especially high risk for PTSD/PTS, i.e., Latino survivors of serious physical injury. Building on the R01 study design, which would entail interviews with physical injury survivors within days of hospitalization and at 5-month follow-up, the planned pilot study would collect blood samples from a subsample of 100 (i.e., 50 males/50 females) at both interviews. Blood data will be linked with interview data to gather preliminary information about the likely magnitude of key epigenetic effects and to determine which of several different genes involved in stress regulation and vulnerability are most promising for further R01 study of sex/gender differences in PTSD.  The planned R21 has the following specific aims: (1) To explore the magnitude and direction of cross-sectional associations between methylation at loci of four  stress- and mood-related genes (PACAP, NR3C1, RORA, ESR1) and lifetime trauma history (number of  events, event severity, type, and chronicity) and baseline PTS in Latino men and women. (2) To determine the degree to which methylation of PACAP, NR3C1, RORA, and ESR1 at the initial post-injury  assessment can explain the link between sex and subsequent PTSD/PTS, after accounting for lifetime  trauma exposure. (3) To appraise whether post-trauma changes in methylation of PACAP, NR3C1, RORA, and ESR1 can be  detected at 5-month follow-up, and whether the magnitude of any change is related to sex or to PTSD/PTS.  The knowledge obtained from the proposed research has the potential to accelerate efforts aimed at reducing PTSD-related sex/gender disparities. Specifically, insofar as epigenetic processes are modifiable, this line of research can lay the foundation for tailored interventions to prevent or treat PTSD/PTSS in men and women. This research may also result in identification of novel biomarkers of vulnerability to PTSD, and insights into whether these markers are sex-specific.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research seeks to understand why women are twice as likely as men to develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following serious physical injury. PTSD is a major cause of human suffering, and study findings will lay the foundation for the development of novel strategies to reduce and prevent PTSD.            ",Sex Gender Differences in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,8895417,R21MH103686,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Human ', ' Interview ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Protein Methylation ', ' Methylation ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' Medical Inspection ', ' Physical Examination ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide ', ' PACAP ', ' pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide ', ' Gender ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' peripheral blood ', ' insight ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' stressor ', ' sensor (biological) ', ' Biosensor ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Early identification ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' NR3C1 ', ' NR3C1 gene ', ' RZRA ', ' RORA ', ' ROR3 ', ' ROR2 ', ' ROR1 ', ' NR1F1 ', ' RORA gene ', ' NR3A1 ', ' ESR1 ', ' ESR1 gene ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Dental Research ', ' NIDR ', ' NIDCR ', ' National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' preclinical trial ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' pre-clinical study ', ' preclinical study ', ' cost ', ' injured ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Trauma ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' ']",NIMH,RAND CORPORATION,R21,2015,251319,0.0025792327642471828
"Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender people are a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. They express their gender-variant identity in various ways and through a multitude of self- labels, both within and outside of binary conceptualizations of sex/gender as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine. While public awareness of this diversity has grown, our understanding of transgender people's experience is limited by a lack of systematic research on their identity development. Health inequities documented among the U.S. transgender population include depression (44%), suicidal ideation (54%) and attempts (31%), anxiety (33%), smoking (36%), and HIV infection (12% based on self- report; 28% on testing). Social stigma attached to gender nonconformity has been proposed as a major contributing factor to these health inequities. Previous research found that the vast majority of transgender individuals experienced discrimination. Much of the data, however, is limited by the use of small convenience samples of transgender women with a history of sex work, recruited from AIDS and social service agencies. The goal of this study is to move beyond these limitations by using purposive, venue-based sampling to recruit a broad, diverse sample of transgender people in 3 U.S. cities--New York, San Francisco, and Atlanta-and enroll them into a mixed-method longitudinal study to test an adaptation of the minority stress model, investigating vulnerability, risk and resilience in the context of identity development. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the process of transgender identity development based on qualitative lifeline interviews with a sample of 90 transgender individuals ages 16 and older, and identify periods of acute vulnerability and characteristics of resilience; (2) Informed by findings from Aim 1, to refine a model combining identity development, minority stress, and resilience, and to develop/adapt measures to assess the model's key constructs; (3) To test the model of resilience in a cohort of transgender individuals (N = 480) stratified by city, gender, and age, and follow them over time (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow up interviews); and (4) To triangulate qualitative and quantitative data on identity development and minority stress processes in order to inform the future development and testing of intervention strategies aimed at fostering resilience and reducing stigma and discrimination. By achieving these aims, this study will make a significant advance in scientific knowledge about gender identity development, minority stress processes (enacted stigma, felts stigma, concealment, shame and their impact on health and psychosocial adjustment), minority coping (on an individual as well as community level), and the development of resilience over time.

"Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women are disproportionately affected by systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and also face worse consequences of disease activity. This proposed study is important to helping improve our understanding of how psychosocial stressors that are salient in the lives of African American women, and in particular experiences of racial discrimination, exacerbate SLE severity and progression. Accomplishing the specific aims of this research will help to unravel factors contributing to racial disparities in this understudied disease, and will also help to identify potential targets of intervention?",Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women,8843792,R01AR065493,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Buffers ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' childrearing ', ' Child Rearing ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Linear Models ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social Identification ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Spottings ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Participant ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' chronic autoimmune disease ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' Minority ', ' Lupus ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' psychobiological ', ' psychobiologic ', ' minimally invasive ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' longitudinal design ', ' social health determinants ', ' young woman ', ' ']",NIAMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2015,531688,0.07630552075158208
"Stress-Related Psychobiology and Inflammation in Diabetic African-American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations are exposed to high levels of trauma and have minimal access to psychiatric and general medical care. The studies proposed in the current application seek to investigate the psychobiological mechanisms responsible for elevated cardiometabolic illness risk in African-American women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and trauma-related psychopathology (post- traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and/or major depressive disorder [MDD]). PTSD in particular, and certain forms of mood and anxiety disorders in general, have been repeatedly associated with dysregulation of the nervous, neuroendocrine, and immune systems that is generally characterized by increased circulating norepinephrine and reduced parasympathetic tone, abnormal secretion of cortisol, and variably elevated systemic inflammation. Quantitative differences in the production of autonomic, neuroendocrine, and inflammatory innate immune mediators of the stress response, distinct from those observed in psychologically healthy subjects, are found in patients with PTSD, MDD, or PTSD/MDD. As a consequence, stress mediators may differentially influence the development and progression of obesity, dyslipidemia, carbohydrate intolerance, and impaired endothelial function in patients affected by PTSD and/or MDD through diagnosis- dependent biological pathways. Although a number of reports suggest a relationship between autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune factors when attempting to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms linking cardiometabolic illnesses and trauma-related psychiatric disorders, to date no studies have examined in a comprehensive manner the ways by which these systems interact. Accordingly, this project seeks to leverage our extensive experience with a low SES, African-American, primary care population with the well-developed research and recruiting infrastructure of the parent project (MH071537) to test the following three hypotheses in a sample of (N=140) female, African-American primary care patients with T2DM: 1.) Significant differences in measures of autonomic and neuroendocrine function assessed before, during, and after psychosocial stress challenge (Trier Social Stress Test) will be identified between trauma- exposed controls and subjects diagnosed with PTSD, MDD, or PTSD+MDD; 2.) Measurements of autonomic function and neuroendocrine mediators collected before, during, and after psychosocial stress challenge will predict measurements of inflammatory mediators collected before, during, and after the psychosocial stress challenge; 3.) Innate inflammatory mediators collected before, during, and after psychosocial stress challenge will predict differences in standard measures of cardiometabolic function (e.g. glucose tolerance test, flow mediated vasodilatation). Knowledge gained by the experiments proposed in this application will increase our understanding of the psychobiology of stress in women with T2DM and trauma-related psychopathology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority populations and individuals of low socioeconomic status are exposed to high levels of trauma and have only minimal access to general medical and psychiatric care. In these populations, stress- related medical and psychiatric disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression are common. Individuals with co-occurring diabetes and post-traumatic stress disorder experience a more severe course of illness than individuals with diabetes alone and the studies proposed in this application will enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms linking stress-related psychiatric illness to medical illness.",Stress-Related Psychobiology and Inflammation in Diabetic African-American Women,9012113,R01MH099211,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Immune Regulators ', ' Immune Mediators/Modulators ', ' Immune Mediators ', ' Biomodulators ', ' Biological Response Modifiers ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Female ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' IPGTT ', ' Glucose tolerance test ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immune system ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' monocyte ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent research suggests that chronic early life stress may pose serious threats to child well-being and set individuals on pathways towards increased physical and mental health problems in adulthood. In addition to being a key health input across the life course, chronic stress is produced through individuals' responses to their environments and thus reflects the interaction of social contexts with biological processes. Improving population health and reducing health disparities necessitates that we understand these socio-biological interactions, particularly during the early stages of the life course when physiological changes may become biologically embedded.  This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in Population Research application addresses this critical research need by proposing a training plan and research agenda that will build on my sociology, family demography and child health background to become an independent, innovative researcher in the area of social contexts, chronic stress and health during childhood. To achieve this goal, I propose formal training and mentoring in the biology of stress, collection and analysi of stress biomarkers, child development, and multilevel modeling. My highly-qualified team of mentors and advisory committee members come from the fields of sociology, demography, epidemiology, nursing, and psychology, reflecting the need for a multi- disciplinary approach in conducting research that integrates biological and social processes.  I will use my training and mentoring in these new areas to answer important research questions about how family contexts are associated with chronic stress in children, and the implications of chronic stress for child health and health disparities in the U.S. In the past four decades, there have been large and pervasive shifts in children's family contexts towards unmarried and unstable parental unions, which are often accompanied by socioeconomic disadvantage. Research suggests that these contexts contribute to child health and development disadvantages and the reproduction of social inequalities across generations. However, there has been little attention to assessing chronic stress as a pathway through which family contexts affect child health.  The expected outcome of this project is paradigm-shifting research that incorporates biological mechanisms into our conceptualization and empirical tests of family context effects on child well-being. Importantly, the conclusions will go beyond a comparison of married vs. unmarried mother families to consider diverse family structures and processes as they impact child stress and health. Using multilevel and population-based data will advance our understanding of the influence of larger social contexts (i.e., neighborhoods and social status) on these processes and will provide generalizable results. These are critical next steps in child health, family demography, and stress research that will set the stage for future research and policy development aimed at reducing chronic stress and health disparities in children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children's family environments have changed dramatically over the past 40 years in the U.S., with potentially important implications for their stress and health. Adverse or unstable family contexts may produce chronic stress in children due to the need for predictability in family relationships and adequate resources (of all types) for healthy child development. Chronic stress, in turn, may pose threats to children's physical, emotional and cognitive development. Understanding the extent to which increasingly diverse and unstable family environments are associated with chronic stress in children, and delineating pathways linking family structure, stress and child outcomes, are important next steps in family demography and child health research. This research will further our understanding of the role of family structure and instability as social determinants of child stress, and biological mechanisms through which family contexts contribute to the reproduction of health and social inequalities.","Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children",9067162,K01HD077063,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Demography ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Siblings ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Social Policies ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unmarried Mother ', ' single motherhood ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Mediating ', ' Unmarried ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' family structure ', ' social inequality ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' Social status ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' Committee Members ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Population Research ', ' Qualifying ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiology Nursing ', ' Family Sociology ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Family Process ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' family influence ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' population health ', ' cognitive development ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' ']",NICHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2016,128450,0.20736118272593346
"Childhood Family Instability, Adult Stress Reactivity, and Consequences for Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The family environments in which children are born and raised have a profound influence on their behavior, education, and health (Amato 2001; Cherlin 1999; McLanahan & Sandefur 2009). With the overlapping demographic and social trends of later age at marriage, greater acceptability of divorce and non-marital childbearing, and more cohabitation, the landscape of American families is diverse and dynamic. According to the recent Census, 29% of American children live with only one biological parent, and 3.5% reside with neither biological parent (Vespa et al. 2013). Such cross-sectional estimates, however, belie the true complexity and dynamism of family structures. Not only do children increasingly live in diverse family forms, but the childhood experience of family structure is dynamic, with children likely to live in a variety of families by the time they reach adulthood (Cavanagh & Huston 2006; Graefe & Lichter 1999; Heuveline et al. 2003).  Using nationally representative integrated demographic, social, contextual and biological data on children in the United States, the proposed study will trace the biological pathways through which childhood family instability influences adult health. The Investigator hypothesizes that family instability creates intense and chronic stress that will be evident in measures of adult stress reactivity and that have negative long-term health consequences. The project will evaluate the importance of instability during sensitive developmental stages of early childhood and adolescence, and investigate gender, race and ethnic differences in stress response processes. This project contributes to the field by examining the enduring health consequences of childhood exposure to dynamic family structures, a common life experience for today's children. Findings will further our understanding of the ways in which the social environment ""gets under the skin"" to influence physiological functioning and biological processes that have consequences for health. Knowledge gained from this project will help more effectively target child welfare policies to crucial developmental periods, and to better understand and reduce health disparities.  An interdisciplinary team of dedicated and highly skilled mentors developed a personalized training plan to support the Investigator in pursuit of her research and career goals. To accomplish the proposed research, the Investigator requires additional substantive and technical training in biology to be achieved through coursework, guided reading, seminars and workshops. The Investigator's professional development will be supported by strengthening her publication record, as well as her grant writing and communication skills. These activities will provide the Investigator with the training necessary to develop expertise in biosocial research and engage in productive interdisciplinary research at the intersection of social and biomedical sciences. The training will also facilitate the Investigator's transition to independent research, and enable her to attain her career goal of securing a faculty position at a leading research university.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this research project is to understand the biological pathways through which childhood family instability influences adult health, testing the role of stress reactivity. The project will evaluate the importance of instability during early childhood and adolescence, and investigate gender, race and ethnic differences in stress response. The results of this project will further our understanding of how the social environments in which we live are biologically embedded, affecting biological processes that often have no immediate outward health consequences but do biological damage for years before disease is manifest.            ","Childhood Family Instability, Adult Stress Reactivity, and Consequences for Health",9206101,F32HD084117,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communication ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Divorced state ', ' Divorce ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Family dynamics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Life Experience ', ' Literature ', ' Marriage ', ' age at marriage ', ' Marriage Ages ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Parents ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' career ', ' Family Study ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' sun ', ' The Sun ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' fetal ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' family structure ', ' parent role ', ' parental role ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' Biosocial ', ' family influence ', ' biological research ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adolescence ', ' Secure ', ' stress reactivity ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F32,2016,54294,0.09775782086427671
"Racial Disparities in Health: The Roles of Stress, Social Relations and the Cardiovascular System Hypertension is the number one cause of racial group disparities in mortality in the U.S. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which race is linked with the cardiovascular system is key. African Americans (AA) are exposed to more stress across the lifespan and lifetime adversity is associated with cardiovascular disease (CHD) and hypertension. However, mechanisms accounting for the links between long-term stress exposure, hypertension and CHD remain unclear. Cardiovascular reactivity is hypothesized to be a major contender as it predicts increased risk of cardiac events and mortality, especially among people with hypertension. According to existing theories of racial health disparities, stress, and social relations, racial health disparities are due to variations in long-term exposure to stress and stress reactivity (biological, psychological, behavioral) and those race differences are moderated by social relations and age. In response to the FOA Aging Research on Stress and Resilience to Address Health Disparities in the United States (RFA-AG-16-022), the present study seeks to understand how long-term stress exposure links with stress reactivity among AA and EA adults. This study capitalizes the existing longitudinal Social Relations and Health Study (SRS),a regionally representative panel sample of AA and EA individuals from the Detroit metropolitan area who began participating in 1992 (ages 13 to 93) and completed the third wave in 2015 (ages 30 to 95). The proposed study will incorporates two new studies of short-term stress reactivity: 1) a daily stress study and 2) a laboratory stress study. The daily stress study will target 300 participants (50% AA; 50%EA) and will incorporate a 4 day experience sampling study of self-reported stress exposure and reactivity (psychological, behavioral) as well as two ambulatory monitoring devices to assess biological reactivity: 1) a newly developed non-invasive continuous monitoring ring device that provides estimates of vascular resistance and 2) a watch that assesses heart rate, heart rate variability, and galvanic skin response. In the laboratory study we will examine reactivity to standard laboratory stressors among a sample of 50 AA and 50 EA respondents who completed the daily stress study to examine more thoroughly their physiological responses to stress with the same ambulatory ring and watch as well as established continuous monitors. The proposed research addresses three aims: 1) Test links between long- term stress exposure and short-term stress reactivity among EA and AA adults, 2) Examine age differences in long-term stress exposure and short-term reactivity by race, and 3) Determine how long-term social relationships moderate individual differences in stress exposure and reactivity. This project has public health significance as it will identify individuals who are more reactive to stress and the immediate as well as lifespan factors that are associated with greater stress reactivity. A more nuanced understanding of the psychological and biological implications of stress among diverse populations will lead to the development and testing of interventions for reducing stress, later health problems, and health disparities. Project Narrative African Americans are more likely to develop hypertension and to die from hypertension than European Americans. This project seeks to understand how long term pattern of stress, social ties, and hypertension contribute to variations in stress exposure and stress reactivity in daily life. The project is particularly significant for public health as identifying individuals who are more reactive to stress may allow for the development of interventions targeting specific populations of individuals who are more at risk of further health problems and mortality.","Racial Disparities in Health: The Roles of Stress, Social Relations and the Cardiovascular System",9205923,R01AG054371,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Outpatient Monitoring ', ' Ambulatory Monitoring ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' stressor ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Devices ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' heart rate variability ', ' stress reactivity ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2016,764345,0.19699063878168138
"Toxic Stress and Protective Factors in Multiethnic School Age Children PROJECT SUMMARY  A toxic stress response can result from exposure to extreme stressors in early childhood, such as poverty, violence or parental mental illness. Persistent elevation of the stress response system causes physiological disruptions that can result in alterations to brain architecture and neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic and cardiovascular functioning. Studies from animals and maltreated children demonstrate that the presence of a nurturing caregiver can buffer against the physiological disruptions associated with a toxic stress response; however, the specific positive caregiving characteristics that best promote a protective relationship in humans remain largely unexplored, particularly in families living in high-risk environments. Framed by an ecobiodevelopmental model, the proposed study employs a cross-sectional design to describe and examine relationships among past maternal experiences with caregiving, current caregiving patterns, and children's indicators of a toxic stress response in a multiethnic, urban sample of maternal-child dyads with children at early school age.  The first aim of this study is to describe physiological (hair cortisol, salivary c-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure), health (body mass index, growth delay) and behavioral (internalizing and externalizing behaviors) indicators of a toxic stress response in children. The second aim of this study is to describe maternal caregiving characteristics in the sample, including past maternal experiences with caregiving (adverse childhood experiences, family strengths) and current caregiving patterns (parental reflective functioning, parenting behaviors). The third aim is to examine correlations among past maternal experiences with caregiving, current caregiving patterns, and indicators of a toxic stress response in children. The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies designed to examine causal relationships between maternal characteristics and indicators of a toxic stress response in children, and may inform the development of interventions aiming to promote health and reduce disparities within families at risk for toxic stress. The proposed training plan includes coursework and a variety of scholarly and research activities to establish a strong foundation in nursing science and concepts related to the study, including maternal-child relationships, health disparities and social determinants of health. The training plan also includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the stress response system and develop my expertise in research methods, especially with complex families living in challenging community environments. Aligned with NINR's strategic plan to promote health and reduce disparities in minority and underserved populations, the proposed study and training plan will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating protective factors for toxic stress in families living with adversity. PROJECT RELEVANCE Exposure to stressful environments in early childhood can cause a toxic stress response, and subsequently lead to poor health outcomes including obesity, cardiac disease, diabetes and mental illness. The purpose of this study is to examine maternal caregiving characteristics that may protect against the physiological, health and behavioral indicators of a toxic stress response in children within families at high risk for exposure to stressors such as poverty, trauma or exposure to violence.",Toxic Stress and Protective Factors in Multiethnic School Age Children,9256843,F31NR016385,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Buffers ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mothers ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Research ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Poverty ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' career ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' Research Activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' mental status ', ' mental state ', ' Metabolic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Salivary ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' parental role ', ' parent role ', ' social ', ' abuse neglect ', ' neglect and abuse ', ' Emotional ', ' maltreated children ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' externalizing behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Alcoholism ', ' Trauma ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' intervention effect ', ' social health determinants ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' impaired brain development ', ' maternal care giving ', ' maternal caregiving ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' ']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,F31,2016,43576,0.1513729139722083
"Stress and Type 2 Diabetes among Indigenous Adults DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This revised RO1 application is in response to the Health Disparities in NIDDK Diseases Program Announcement (PA-09-262). It focuses on American Indians (AI) whose rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) are the highest in the world. This population also copes with disproportionate stressors including economic disadvantage, unemployment, community violence, discrimination, and the long- term effects of historical cultural traumas and losses. Yet, paradoxically, AI people tend to score lower on some self-report measures of stress and have lower prevalence rates of stress-related mental disorders such as major depressive episode and anxiety disorders. The goals of the proposed research are to advance measurement of stress processes among AI people through comparisons of stress biomarkers and self-report measures; and to use multiple indicators of stress including stress biomarkers to investigate the interactions between stress processes T2D disease progression and treatment compliance among AI adults. This community based participatory research is based on partnerships with five Ojibwe reservations in Minnesota and Wisconsin who invited the research team to work with their clinics. The first specific aim is to couple our existing preliminary data on community salient stressors with new qualitative feedback on existing measures to adapt and subsequently examine via pilot surveys the psychometric properties of stress measures for this population. The second specific aim is to investigate the relationship between stress biomarkers and self-reported psychosocial stressors, symptoms of distress, and diagnostic measures of anxiety, depression, and trauma to ascertain the degree to which self report measures are indicative of actual physiological stress levels among a cohort of 200 AI adults who have been recently diagnosed with T2D. The third specific aim is to follow a cohort of 200 recently diagnosed T2D AI adults for two years to investigate an innovative conceptual model (Figure 1) of multiple measures of stress processes, treatment compliance, mental health, and risk factors for disease complications This health disparities research will advance our understanding of stress processes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) among American Indian (AI) people by refining measures of stress among this population through use of stress biomarkers and cultural adaptation/development of self-report stress measures. It will then prospectively investigate the effects of stress on T2D disease progression by following a cohort of 200 newly diagnosed AI adults for a period of two years.",Stress and Type 2 Diabetes

"Chronic stress and executive function in children: a neuroimaging study of twins ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The experience of chronic stressors in early childhood, such as family poverty, neighborhood and school chaos, and family conflict have substantial negative consequences for life course physical and mental health, academic achievement, and ultimate social, educational, and economic attainment. With this proposal, we focus on neurobiological mechanisms that link chronic stress associated with family, neighborhood, and school disadvantage to impaired academic achievement. We hypothesize that the association between chronic stress and academic achievement is mediated by the effects of cortisol on executive functions. Executive functions are regulatory processes that support the acquisition of academic skills by allowing the learner to store information temporarily, adapt to task demands, and pay attention to relevant stimuli. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies indicate that the child brain exhibits characteristic patterns of activation during executive functioning tasks. Many of these same regions have high concentrations of glucocorticoid receptors. Thus, stress-related disruptions in cortisol function are likely to affect the neural bases of executive functions. Cortisol is typically conceptualized s a mediator of the effects of environmental stress; however, genes also influence cortisol function. No previous study has comprehensively tested whether mechanisms underlying cortisol-achievement associations are purely environmental and whether, additionally or alternatively, cortisol is a physiological endophenotype that mediates genetic influences on executive functions and academic achievement. The proposed research will combine cutting-edge methods and technologies from endocrinology and neuroscience with well-developed methods from human ecology and behavioral genetics to explore the associations between chronic stress, cortisol, executive functions, and achievement. We will collect socioecological data, hair cortisol samples, executive function data, and school transcript achievement outcomes from a diverse and population-representative sample of 300 twins (150 pairs, 50% monozygotic) in grade 3, half of whom (N=150 twins from 75 pairs) will participate in fMRI scanning during performance of executive function tasks. This highly innovative and cross-disciplinary approach will allow us to: (1) Test the magnitude and shape of associations between hair cortisol and key study variables - socioecological stress, executive functions, and academic achievement; (2)Test a multivariate model of the mediating roles of cortisol and executive functions on the association between stress and achievement; and (3) Estimate the extent to which key pathways identified in the mediation model occur via genetic and/or environmental mechanisms. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Prolonged exposure to stress during childhood impairs both academic achievement and the executive functions that support learning. Using a population-representative sample of twins in grade 3, this project will investigate interrelations between academic achievement and measures and biomarkers of chronic stress. Results will inform interventions and policies designed to ameliorate inequalities in academic achievement and maximize children's potentials for healthy development and learning.",Chronic stress and executive function in children: a neuroimaging study of twins,9038394,R21HD081437,"['Accounting ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Environment ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' indexing ', ' Learning ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Genetic Models ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Poverty ', ' Glucocorticoid Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Dizygotic Twins ', ' Fraternal Twins ', ' Monozygotic twins ', ' Identical Twins ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' hydrocortisone receptor ', ' hydrocortisone-receptor complex ', ' cortisol receptors ', ' HCTRPCX ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Stimulus ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Inequality ', ' Twin Studies ', ' Therapeutic Steroid Hormone ', ' steroid hormone ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Endocrine ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' neural network ', ' Biological Neural Networks ', ' early childhood ', ' receptor density ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' genetic testing ', ' gene-based testing ', ' gene testing ', ' Genetic screening method ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Genetic analyses ', ' genetic analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan ', ' MRI Scans ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Brain region ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' exploratory developmental study ', ' R21 Program ', ' R21 Mechanism ', ' Exploratory/Developmental Grant ', ' Transcript ', ' Update ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Impairment ', ' endophenotype ', ' neuropsychological ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Academic skills ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2016,192895,0.11043859289621206
"Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child Biology and Behavior DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable evidence documenting the effects of prenatal maternal stress and emotions on birth and early child outcomes, the biological pathways by which maternal stress is transferred to children are not yet well understood. The proposed study will test a set of novel hypotheses about maternal stress and allostatic load (physiological dysregulation across multiple systems due to cumulative wear-and-tear associated with chronic and acute stress exposure) during the preconception and prenatal periods. The study focuses primarily on HPA axis regulatory mechanisms in a sample of 201 diverse mother-child pairs, particularly the prediction of child neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress regulation at ages 2 and 3 and cellular aging (indexed by telomere length) in both young children and their mothers. Our inclusion of the preconception period is innovative and yields a more comprehensive understanding of developmental origins (including fetal programming) of later health and developmental competence. One overall objective is to identify modifiable risk factors that can be targeted for early effective prevention of adverse health, neurocognitive, and behavioral outcomes throughout the lifespan.  Participants will be recruited from an enrolled cohort of ethnically diverse, mostly low-income women in Washington, DC and Lake County, IL near Chicago as part of a large multi-site NIH collaborative study (Child Community Health Network Study; CCHN). The parent study includes extensive interview measures of maternal stress in preconception and pregnancy and maternal biomarkers that pose risk for disease in the next generation, creating a unique opportunity to examine prospective predictors of child outcomes. The specific aims are to examine effects of maternal stress and allostatic load, especially HPA regulation during preconception and in pregnancy on outcomes at ages 2 and 3. The outcomes are: (1) children's cortisol responses to acute laboratory stressors and circadian regulation of cortisol production; (2) children's fearful or anxious temperament measured by innovative observational laboratory testing; (3) children's neurocognitive functioning using standardized assessments; (4) children's leukocyte telomere length at age 2 and rates of shortening from ages 2 to 3. We will also examine leukocyte telomere length of mothers as a function of stress and test for mother-child associations.  RELEVANCE: This study addresses an NICHD research priority in 2011 to identify developmental origins of susceptibility to later health, disease, and longevity. Results will provide the first evidence about plausible biological pathways prior to pregnancy that, in turn, program prenatal and postnatal development, taking into consideration many other known environmental and biological influences. The findings have the potential to yield new understanding about the pervasive, serious maternal and child health disparities that extend throughout the lifespan and disproportionately impact low income, minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adult diseases with developmental origins including neurocognitive disorders are estimated to take an immense toll on our nation's health. The proposed research will prospectively investigate whether maternal factors in the preconception period and in pregnancy, especially stress and HPA regulatory mechanisms, alter the behavioral, stress regulatory and neurocognitive outcomes of young children, as well as effects on cellular aging processes in mother-child pairs. Findings will provide a new foundation for developing potentially powerful preventive interventions to improve children's lifelong well-being.",Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child Biology and Behavior,9063071,R01HD072021,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Chicago ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

These disparities are a problem because they describe increased risk for chronic diseases and early death for lower SES individuals and large costs to the U.S. economy due to health care and lost productivity. The long-term goal is to better understand the pathways by which lower SES results in worse health. The overall objective in this R03 is to test chronic stress as an explanation of SES-related health disparities. In contrast to previous daily stress studies, this R03 uses data from an economically and racially diverse sample of adults and has fine-grained data regarding the timing of stressors. The central hypothesis, drawn from several health disparity theories, is that lower SES individuals experience persistent exposure and prolonged response to stressors and that this frequent and extended activation of emotional responses results in physical wear-and-tear and eventual disease. The rationale for the proposed research is that by understanding the pathways by which SES-related stress reduces physical health, interventions can be developed to reduce physical symptoms on a daily basis and delay or prevent disease over the long-term. Guided by preliminary work, this chronic stress hypothesis will be tested on short- and long-time scales. Specific aims extended from this hypothesis include: 1) Test the prediction that, over the short-term, low SES will be associated with more frequent daily stressors and emotional responses to stressors which are larger in magnitude and duration, 2) Test the prediction that, on a daily basis, having emotional responses to daily stressors which are larger magnitude and longer duration predicts experiencing more frequent and severe physical symptoms on a daily basis, and 3) Test the prediction that, over a lifetime, low SES in childhood predicts worse physical health in adulthood because of more exposure to stressors and reduced psychosocial resources with which to respond to them. Under the first aim, magnitude of emotional reactivity will be distinguished from duration of emotional recovery - which the applicant has demonstrated is feasible in her preliminary work. Under the second aim, these magnitude and duration slopes of emotional responses to stressors across the day will be used to predict end of day physical symptoms. In the third aim, childhood and lifetime stress will be tested as mediators of the effects of objectiv indices of childhood SES on adult health. The approach is innovative, in the applicant's opinion, because it tests theory-based predictions for health disparities, leverages a diverse sample, and approaches the predictions at multiple time scales. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance and expand understanding of how SES disadvantage results in wide disparities in health. Such knowledge has the potential to direct interventions to the chronic stress pathways most predictive of daily and long-term health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because the identification of the paths by which chronic stress results in worse day-to-day and long-term health is expected to increase understanding of socio- economic status related health disparities. The proposed research is relevant to the part of NIH's mission that pertains to developing fundamental knowledge to protect health. It direct aligns with the U.S. Health and Human Services' Healthy People 2020 initiative of eliminating health disparities.",Chronic Stress as a Pathway to Health Disparities,9132158,R03AG050798,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Buffers ', ' Grain ', ' Cereals ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Emotions ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' indexing ', ' Mission ', ' Moods ', ' Personality ', ' Physiology ', ' Play ', ' Productivity ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Work ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Resolution ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Coronary ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' daily functioning ', ' positive emotion ', ' positive emotional state ', ' aged ', ' Cognitive aging ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' demographics ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' temporal measurement ', ' time measurement ', ' temporal resolution ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' physical symptom ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,R03,2016,26964,0.10605174397403752
"Exploring Stress,Aging and Health Among Parents of Sexual Minorities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Institute of Medicine recently issued a report on ""The Health of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender People"" (2011), which was followed by a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) from The National Institutes of Health regarding ""Research on the Health of LGBTI Populations."" This FOA highlights the need for research on lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, and related populations. The proposed study seeks to examine stress, aging, and health among midlife and older parents of adult lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons (LGBs), an under-studied population that is likely to encounter unique social stressors associated with the sexual minority status of their daughters and sons. We hypothesize that the health of these parents is significantly influenced by the sexual minority stress experiences of their children via the process of stress proliferation. We additionally posit that these stressors may influence the occurrence and/or impact of other stressors, and stress moderators, including specifically parental ambivalence. If this is the case, millions of American parents are at risk for sexual minority stress-related insults to their health. Previous research has documented health disparities between sexual minorities and heterosexuals, but whether these disparities extend to their parents is unknown because these parents are largely invisible and, therefore, existing studies have relied on convenience samples, severely limiting the generalizability of findings. The often rancorous sociopolitical climate in the U.S. regarding LGB civil rights compounds the situation because sexual minority issues are no longer ""closeted"" and are an open part of public discourse, to the satisfaction of some parents and the displeasure of others. We propose a study of stress processes affecting parents of adult LGBs using a nationally representative sample and based on an original LGB Parental Stress Model. Testing our innovative model will set the stage for a subsequent R01 study on parents of LGBs that will conceptually re-orient how we view their roles at the individual, familial, and societal levels. Ou specific aims are to: 1) Develop and pilot test a survey (English/Spanish) that assesses: (a) generic parental stress among self-identified parents of adult LGBs and parents without adult LGB children; (b) parental ambivalence for both groups; (c) sexual minority stress specifically among parents of LGBs; and (d) other pertinent stress domains; 2) Field this survey with a randomly drawn sample of 500 parents of adult LGBs from a nationally representative panel of U.S. adults and a comparison sample of 500 parents without LGB children; 3) Test the extent to which within-group variation in health among parents of LGBs is uniquely explained by sexual minority stress and interactions with parental ambivalence, age/cohort, and aging-related stress; 4) Ascertain whether there are health differences between the two groups of parents, and if so, the extent to which these differences can be attributed to heightened parental ambivalence and/or sexual minority stress among parents of LGBs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The Institute of Medicine recently issued a report that highlights health disparities between sexual minorities and heterosexuals and emphasizes how stigma, discrimination, internalized homophobia, and the need to conceal one's sexual orientation are widespread forms of sexual minority stress that are harmful to the health of lesbian, gay, and bisexual persons (LGBs). Surprisingly little is known about the millions of parents of LGBs, however, and population-based research on the health consequences of sexual minority stress ""contagion"" among these parents is nonexistent. The proposed study uses a nationally representative sample to explore sexual minority stress and health among midlife and older parents of adult LGBs, creating a model approach for subsequent stress and health research on these parents who are now growing older in the context of having traversed a historical era of tremendous personal, familial, and societal change regarding LGBs.","Exploring Stress,Aging and Health Among Parents of Sexual Minorities",8994701,R21AG047361,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Attitude ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Civil Rights ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Daughter ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' positive attitude ', ' Happiness ', ' Health ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' interpersonal relationship ', ' Interpersonal Interaction ', ' Interpersonal Relations ', ' Learning ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Shame ', ' Son ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Generic Drugs ', ' generic ', ' Nonproprietary Drugs ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' contagion ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' displeasure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' field survey ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' population based ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia  ', ' Homophobic ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Intersex ', ' LGBTI ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' study population ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2016,192500,0.07014025412260985
"Sleep, Biological Stress, and Health among Toddlers Living in Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Homes PROJECT SUMMARY Healthy sleep is important to behavioral, neurobiological, and physiologic health. Emerging literature suggests that stress biomarkers, such as cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), and body mass index (BMI) increase when healthy sleep habits are not regularly practiced among older children and adults. These biomarkers are associated with stress and increased risk for future disease. Researchers suggest that young children from racial/ethnic minority groups and/or living with socioeconomic adversity are especially vulnerable to poor sleep beginning within the first year of life. However, little is known about the relationships among sleep characteristics, stress, and health among very young children living with adversity. The proposed study will address this important scientific gap. This study will improve our understanding of these relationships during a critical developmental period in children's lives – toddlerhood. Using a longitudinal design with repeated measures to prospectively examine the relationships among sleep characteristics, stress, and toddler's health from age 12 months to 24 months, we will address the following aims: 1. Examine changes in subjective and objective sleep characteristics from 12 to 24 months of age; 2. Examine changes in stress biomarkers from 12 to 24 months of age; 3. Examine the cross sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep characteristics and stress response; 4. Examine the cross sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep characteristics and toddlers' behavioral health. The sample will include 113 toddlers who live in socioeconomically disadvantaged homes. Data will be collected during at two time points (age 12 months and 24 months). Data on sleep characteristics will include subjective and objective measures of sleep duration and efficiency, obtained with questionnaires, diaries, and 9 days/nights of sleep actigraphy. Multi-systemic biomarkers of stress including cortisol, C-reactive protein, S-IgA, and BMI, will be measured individually and then explored as a latent variable of stress. Caregiver-reported behavioral health problems will be measured as it is closely associated with children's present and future health. Indicators of economic, environmental, and psychological adversity will be obtained and their relationships with primary variables will be explored. Generalized linear models will be used in the data analysis. Data from this study will be used to support future R-series grant applications designed to further understand the relationships among sleep, stress, and health by following these children over time with additional measures of stress and health to identify causal pathways and ultimately test the effects of interventions, such as those that may improve sleep, among young children at risk for toxic stress. While my past clinical and research experience focused on interventions to support parent- child relationships among families living with adversity, the next step in my career development is to acquire training to understand behavioral and biological aspects of sleep and stress and to explore the extent to which healthy sleep buffers toddlers' stress response to chronic stress early in life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The experience of socioeconomic adversity is a chronic stressor that may result in poor sleep, including shortened sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency beginning early in life. The occurrence of poor sleep early during critical developmental periods, such as toddlerhood, may interfere with the young children's ability to maintain homeostasis within their stress response system and compound their risk for stress-related health problems. The proposed training plan and research study will focus on understanding the longitudinal relationships among sleep, multiple biomarkers of stress, and health among toddlers living in socioeconomically disadvantaged homes.","Sleep, Biological Stress, and Health among Toddlers Living in Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Homes",9241751,K23NR016277,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Buffers ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' critical developmental period ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Secretory IgA ', ' SIgA ', ' Exocrine IgA ', ' Secretory Immunoglobulin A ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' career development ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' actigraphy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' intervention effect ', ' longitudinal design ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' economic indicator ', ' ']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2016,152515,0.04432768022506743
"Identity Stress and Health in Three Cohorts of LGB individuals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth and adults suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Minority stress theory suggests that because of prejudice and stigma in the social environment, LGB people experience excess stress that leads to poor health outcomes and health disparities. Because of its focus on the social environment, minority stress theory leads us to predict that the character of stress processes affecting LGBs shift along with improvement in the social environment. Similarly shifting are notions of LGB identity, connection with the community, and the types of social and health services LGB people seek. If we are to achieve the U.S. Public Health Services' goal of reducing health disparities related to sexual orientation, we need to understand the impact of changes in identity and minority stress on LGB health and, using this knowledge, inform public health interventions across the lifespan. To gain this knowledge, we propose a longitudinal study using a probability sample of diverse LGBs representative of LGBs in the U.S. population. We seek to compare 3 cohorts of LGB individuals-aged 18 - 25, 34 - 42, and 48 - 55 years old-who are distinct in that they were exposed to significantly different social environments when they came of age. We are interested in ways that identity and minority stress predict health across the cohorts. We will use a mixed method design that allows us to gain knowledge from both qualitative and survey data. We use an innovative 2-stage procedure to recruit a sample of 676 LGB individuals representative of U.S. Black, Latino, and White LGB populations. We assess respondents baseline and annually for 3 years thereafter. In a qualitative study, we use a narrative life history to assess a diverse group of Black, Latino, White, and Asian LGB individuals in urban and rural regions of New York, California, and Arizona. We hypothesize that: 1. Despite readily acknowledging an LGB identity and coming out at a younger age than did older cohorts, the younger cohorts differ from older cohorts in that their LGB identity is less central, they are less strongly identified with the LGB community, and have different meanings of sexual orientation and identity. 2. Compared with older, the younger cohort experience less minority stress related to their own acceptance of a gay identity and coming out, but more external stress, including prejudice-related stressful life events, antigay violence, and everyday forms of discrimination. 3. Members of younger LGB cohorts utilize fewer LGB-identified social and health services than do members of older LGB cohorts. 4. In structural equations, the minority stress model functions equally well in predicting health outcomes in the younger and older cohorts, but patterns of stress, resilience, and health outcomes differ among the cohorts in accordance with findings in Aims 1 and 2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth continue to suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Social changes have significantly altered the developmental trajectories of today's LGB youth, requiring that we reexamine our knowledge of stress and health in this population. This knowledge is required for improving provision of health services interventions and achieving PHS goal of reducing health disparities related to sexual orientation.",Identity Stress and Health in Three Cohorts of LGB individuals,9063435,R01HD078526,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Arizona ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' Influentials ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Study models ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Prejudice ', ' Probability Samples ', ' Public Health ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States Public Health Service ', ' USPHS ', ' Public Health Service ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Friends ', ' Generations ', ' Latino ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Gays ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' life history ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' model development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Social Health Services ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' service intervention ', ' Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' public health intervention ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' community center ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R01,2016,886481,0.12704509021039165
"Biomarkers of Health Risk Among African American Couples ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation (INF) predicts the onset of chronic, age-related diseases. Although psychosocial stress is a major determinant of INF, we know little about the role of stress contagion from romantic partners, a prominent social context in early adulthood, or the role of childhood stressors in amplifying INF response to adult stress. Evidence has accumulated indicating that early stress experiences may shift propensity to respond with INF due to early calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR). However, we have little information regarding the extent to which IRTR predicts amplified INF response to adult stressors or the extent which it accounts for the impact of early stressors on INF. In addition, we do not know the extent to which persistent, supportive relationships in young adulthood have the potential to ameliorate the impact of earlier stressors by modifying IRTR and so reducing INF in response to adult stressors. Finally, prior research has largely focused on White samples, thereby limiting our understanding of the causes of INF among African Americans, a group at elevated risk for age- related chronic illness. This application seeks funding to add assessment of romantic partners and to directly assess IRTR for both targets and partners who are participating in a recently funded application. In the parent application we assess INF and collect telephone interview data from targets regarding stress and health behaviors in a sample of roughly 700 African Americans (now 28 years of age). In the current application we add parallel interview assessments and assessment of INF for N = 320 romantic partners. In addition we add assessment of IRTR for both targets and romantic partners. This additional data collection will allow us to address the following specific aims: 1) Identify the effect of stress contagion on young adult INF among African Americans, controlling for own stressors and history of early exposure to stressors; 2) Test hypothesized amplification of effect on INF of own stress, stress contagion, and dyad-level effects due to exposure to early stressors, and examine the hypothesis that calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR) is the mechanism by which early stress influences INF; and 3) Test the hypothesized role of persistent supportive romantic relationships (PSR) in ""recalibrating"" stress biology, i.e., examine the hypothesis that among those in persistent supportive relationships in young adulthood we will see reduced impact of early stress exposure on IRTR. The Institute of Medicine prescribes development of prevention based on longitudinal, epidemiological research with target populations. Currently, no prospective investigations identify the protective factors that interrup the impact of stress on INF for African Americans. The results of the proposed research will identify protective processes and serve as the basis for empirically- based, health disparities prevention programs as well as provide a basis for ongoing policy discussions, e.g. the Healthy Marriage Initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving quality of longer lives requires information about sources of the inflammation linked to age- related, chronic diseases; causes that include social relationships and may lie at earlier stages of development. Building on prior research documenting the role of childhood stress in amplifying inflammatory responses to adult stress, the present study examines the interaction of child stress with stress contagion from adult romantic partners as well as ameliorative effects due to persistent, supportive romantic relationships, and so provides a foundation for development of preventative interventions to protect against amplified inflammation and a framework for ongoing policy discussions such as the healthy marriage initiative.",Biomarkers of Health Risk Among African American Couples,9049525,R01HD080749,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Calibration ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' Marriage ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' psychosocial ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' social model ', ' stressor ', ' contagion ', ' Prevention program ', ' mate ', ' Partner in relationship ', ' Prevention ', ' sorting ', ' Sorting - Cell Movement ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' healthy aging ', ' parent project ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2016,601156,0.20612964275731316
"RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULTS' PATHWAYS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong African American Families Healthy Adult Project (SHAPE) followed 493 African American youth from ages 11 to 20. Participants have grown up in rural Georgia communities in which poverty rates for African Americans are among the highest in the nation. Life in rural areas can be more challenging than in urban areas due to restricted educational and employment opportunities, difficulties in obtaining physical and mental health care, and a lack of public transportation. Despite living in such challenging situations, many SHAPE participants have displayed high levels of psychosocial functioning across adolescence. We identified naturally occurring factors in family and community networks that protected these youth from the consequences of SES- and race-related stressors that proliferate in rural Southern contexts. Epidemiological research reveals that African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of chronic diseases of aging (CDA) such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence indicates that contemporaneous health determinants in midlife or later cannot adequately account for why rural African Americans experience high rates of CDAs. Rather, many CDAs incubate in physiological systems for decades prior to the manifestation of disease. In the next 5 years, SHAPE participants will experience a stressful developmental transition. Job turnover rates are high, and the combined effects of poor preparation for employment and discriminatory hiring practices make obtaining stable employment a protracted and often demoralizing process. These stressors have the potential to take a toll on SHAPE participants' health, undermining psychosocial functioning and contributing to CDA-related vulnerabilities. To understand the pathways from stress exposure during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood to CDA vulnerabilities and psychosocial outcomes, we propose to extend the SHAPE research program in two key ways. First we propose to augment our health assessment of SHAPE participants to include markers of metabolic syndrome and pro-inflammatory tendencies which are linked to the development of CDAs. Second, we propose to investigate a critical question for public health scientists and practitioners. In response to stress exposure, some SHAPE participants will evince escalation in CDA vulnerability whereas other will not. This proposal is designed to investigate why. Evidence from laboratory-based studies suggests a central role for psychosocial risk and protective mechanisms in young adulthood and earlier phases of development in altering the pathways linking stress exposure and CDA precursors. Prospective research investigating these risk and protective mechanisms, however, is virtually nonexistent. We thus propose to collect data from SHAPE participants, at ages 22 and 24 years, that includes CDA precursors along with assessments of environmental stressors, psychosocial adjustment, risk and protective mechanisms, HPA axis/SNS deregulation, and health behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of health disparities. Recent research suggests that the roots of these disparities lie in earlier stages of development as young people cope with stressful environments. In this study we investigate the risk and protective processes that explain why some young adult rural African Americans develop vulnerabilities to chronic diseases and others do not.",RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULTS' PATHWAYS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH,9090193,R01HD030588,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Laboratories ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Stress ', ' Sympathetic Nervous System ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Weather ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Incubated ', ' Data ', ' Proliferating ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' racial identity ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2016,601220,0.058360032826123245
"Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now large-scale epidemiological evidence that aspects of chronic psychological stress, such as early adversity or job strain, and early life stress, predict earlier disease onset and mortality. Despite documentation of the importance of stress to health, there are several critical barriers that prevent progress in the epidemiological study of stress as a risk factor for disease. Measurement of stress is inherently complex and multi-level (e.g., social, psychological, physiological). There are few agreed upon 'gold standard' measures of stress, hence measurement is often inconsistent and superficial where heterogeneous constructs are conflated. There is also little understanding of the conditions under which stress exposure can promote vulnerability vs. resiliency to disease. Meanwhile, there have been rapid advances in the basic science of stress processes, which have helped to unpack the cognitive and affective components, links to brain and peripheral physiological responses, and richer measures of daily stress - e.g., through ecological momentary assessments using technology to obtain detailed profiles of exposures and contexts. Thus, epidemiological stress science can benefit from a more coherent multilevel model that encompasses better measurement of lifespan exposures and responses, including the social, psychological, and physiological indices of stress that have the greatest impact on health. The proposed R24 will recruit excellent scientists with relevant methods to apply their interests to th advancement of stress measurement across human development, with a focus on how lifespan stress affects health in mid to late life. Aims include: 1) Development of a stress measurement taxonomy, including guidelines for best measurement; 2) Development of a 'toolbox' of short measures of stress that can be used in epidemiological studies of adult aging internationally. These will be drawn from innovative measurement from basic experimental and field research, refinement/shortening of existing measures, and results from comparative validation of promising measures; and 3) Promotion of stress research in epidemiological studies of aging, both through harmonizing existing measures and adding new toolbox measures. This in turn will lead to discoveries that refine the taxonomy and research methodologies. Improved stress measurement offers tremendous opportunities for advancing the field of basic research, enhancing the efficacy of health-promotion interventions and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic stress can impair health, but the mechanisms are not well known and the measures that investigators use are diverse and inconsistent. This network will promote better theory and new measures, and develop a ""stress measurement toolbox,"" that large-scale studies can use. This in turn will lead to a deeper understanding of how stress affects psychological well-being as well as disease etiology and progression, and ways to intervene.",Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging,9060875,R24AG048024,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' indexing ', ' intern ', ' Internships ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Paper ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' validation studies ', ' Impaired health ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' comparative ', ' critical period ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' standard measure ', ' population health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' study population ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R24,2016,275996,0.1939187416217695
"Setting a trajectory: biological markers of early stress and child development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To identify at-risk children precise indicators of the biological changes associated with early life adversity, including prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and racial disparities are needed. Without reliable indicators capable of providing mechanistic insight the ability to design and implement innovative interventions, and alter negative developmental trajectories, remains limited. Alterations in the stress response system, determined by salivary cortisol levels, are associated with PNMS. Disrupted parent-child attachment, as well as the therapeutic repair of this relationship, has also been found to influence the cortisol response in infants. However, the stress hypo-responsive period in early childhood may limit the utility of cortisol as a stand-alone indicator during this critical developmental time point. Additionally, while cortisol indicates dysregulation in the HPA axis it provides minimal mechanistic information. The established role of genetic and epigenetic factors, including FKBP5 and miRNAs, to both the responsiveness and adaptation of the HPA axis suggest they play an important role in the underlying mechanism. Concurrent measurement of gene expression, miRNA, and cortisol is expected to more robustly define how early adversity is biological embedded. Saliva represents an ideal accessible biological source that reflects an individual's complex internal milieu. Recent evidence indicates that mRNA, miRNA and telomere length can be reliably measured in saliva. Studies have also demonstrated changes in each of these markers with exposure to early adversity and stress. These collective findings indicate that an epigenetic psychophysiological profile concurrently measuring each component is feasible and a critical next step in research seeking to chart the trajectory of mental illness and define the earliest intervention time points. This study expects to enroll infants of African American women with extensive characterization of PNMS and maternal preconception adversity. Saliva will be collected pre and post a known stressor designed to activate the HPA axis at two early developmental time points. Infants will be stressed before (4 months, using the Still Face Procedure) and after (12 months, using the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP)) the development of attachment. The cortisol response to the stressor, fold change in FKBP5 mRNA pre/post the stressor as well as initial levels of miR-134 and miR-16 and telomere length will be determined. Leveraging the increased statistical power associated with propensity score matching this proposal will test the association between PNMS, attachment and salivary markers while controlling for preconception adversity. Achievement of the proposal aims of this proposal is expected to provide enhanced biological evidence in support of the implementation of attachment based interventions early in the life course. The critical need to more effectively address persistent health disparities and decrease the negative health outcomes associated with toxic stress requires the development of innovative methodologies that both define biological mechanisms and track the effectiveness of interventions at the behavioral, physiologic, and molecular level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because an enhanced mechanistic understanding of the biological embedding of early adversity is ultimately expected to lead to novel interventions and preventive efforts that alter the life-long negative health trajectories associated with toxic stress and health disparities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIMH's mission that pertains to strengthening the public health impact of NIMH funded research and to charting mental illness trajectories to determine when to intervene.",Setting a trajectory: biological markers of early stress and child development,9054931,R01MH101533,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Infant ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Motion ', ' premRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' mRNA ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Saliva ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Tacrolimus Binding Proteins ', ' FKBP Rotamase ', ' FKBP ', ' FK506 Binding Proteins ', ' FK-506-Binding Protein ', ' telomere ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Salivary ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' hypothalamic pituitary axis ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' disease classification ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ', ' DSM ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Age-Months ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Security ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Secure ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ']",NIMH,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2016,534446,0.10772012518117609
"Social Determinants of Inflammation and Metabolic Syndrom among African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation (INF) and metabolic syndrome (MS) represent dysregulated biological systems that predict onset of chronic, age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and dementia. Although a wealth of findings has indicated that psychosocial stress is a major determinant of INF and MS, a number of crucial questions remain unanswered. First, we do not know whether sensitive period (early biological programming), stress accumulation, social schematic, or mismatch models best account for the development of INF and MS. Second, we have little information regarding the range of stressors within a developmental period that are most critical. Studies of childhood stress usually simply assess low SES or exposure to harsh parenting, and these measurements typically entail retrospective reports. Research on the effect of adult stress sometimes includes community context but usually fails to consider the way that childhood stress may moderate reactions to adult stressors. And, whether the focus is childhood or adult adversity, there has been limited consideration of the way that race-related stressors such as segregation, perceived racism, discrimination, and internalized racism impact biological dysregulation. Third, we know little about the extent to which factors such as parental support, racial socialization, social support, or religiosity operate to reduce the deleterious impact of childhood, adolescent, or adult stressors on INF and MS. A final limitation of past research is that it has focused, with a few exceptions, on White samples whereas African Americans display significantly higher rates of almost every type of chronic illness and score higher on biomarkers of INF and most indictors of MS. In order to address these unanswered questions and limitations, this application seeks funding to add biomarkers of INF and MS, as well as telephone interview data regarding stress and health behaviors, to the 18 years of longitudinal data that has been collected on the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS) sample of roughly 700 African Americans (now 28 years of age). Specifically, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) identify the cluster of SE- and race-related stressors experienced in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood that best predict adult INF and MS. 2) Use these stress indices to test competing models regarding the manner in which stressors from various developmental periods combine to influence biological dysregulaton. And, 3) investigate the extent to which the experience of supportive parenting and racial socialization during childhood, and/or supportive relationships and religiosity during adulthood, are moderating factors that promote healthy biomarkers for INF and MS. There are few, if any, efficacious preventive interventions that address the causes of health disparities. The Institute of Medicine prescribes that such efforts be based on the results of longitudinal, epidemiological research with target populations. Currently, there are no prospective investigations that identify the protective factors that interrupt the translation of social determinants of stress into biological vulnerabilities for African Americans. The results of the proposed research will identify protective processes and serve as the basis for empirically-based, health disparities preventive interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving the quality of longer lives requires information regarding the causes of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and dementia. In recent years, strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation and metabolic syndrome represent dysregulated biological systems that predict onset of these illnesses.

"NEURAL MECHANISMS IN WOMEN’S TREATMENT AND EARLY RECOVERY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychological stress is a causal factor in the pathogenesis of substance use disorder (SUD) and relapse risk. Low-income women report high levels of stress in SUD residential treatment stemming from significant economic and family stressors in addition to challenges adjusting to residential treatment demands. Unmanaged stress, especially in early stages of residential treatment, is a major concern because it can increase dropout. Dropout from residential treatment places women at risk of substance use relapse. A gap in knowledge persists regarding the use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) with racially and ethnically diverse low-income women with SUDs, especially regarding the efficacy of adapted MBIs for preventing residential dropout and decreasing relapse. The long-term goal of this application is to improve treatment outcomes in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women with SUDs by targeting stress, residential dropout, and relapse. We have fully adapted, developed, and pilot tested a novel MBI, Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery: Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention for Women (MBRP-W), that supports the needs of women in residential treatment. It showed promising results in substance use and perceived stress outcomes and no racial or ethnic differences in outcomes. This MBI integrates relapse prevention, addresses literacy level, and is relevant to issues surrounding treatment- and relapse-related stressors of disadvantaged women. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to test the efficacy of MBRP-W on residential treatment (a) retention and (b) substance use relapse in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women to determine; (2) the mechanisms of change underlying the MBRP-W program; and (3) if changes in hair cortisol as a marker of chronic stress provide a more powerful measure of stress compared to self- reported stress as a mechanism of change. A rationale for MBRP-W is the need for self-initiated stress management skills in women with SUDs during the early stressful periods of residential treatment that increase risk of dropout and relapse. The unique strengths of this application are its focus on underserved populations, residential dropout, and relapse outcomes, and the first-ever inclusion of a chronic stress biomarker in MBI research in the form of hair cortisol. The proposed work is innovative in that it intends to reduce stress in women to improve both retention and relapse outcomes. The expected results will define a viable integrative treatment that can improve stress management skills and treatment outcomes and will evaluate the utility of a biomarker of chronic stress. Results of this study will have a positive impact on substance use recovery outcomes in diverse groups of low-income women and identify mechanisms of action to inform future SUD treatment. The project's public health impact meets NIDA goals because it intends to prevent the escalation of addiction and its health consequences by offering a novel treatment accessible to undeserved women that is expected to decrease addiction-related racial and ethnic and gender-based health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 25 million Americans struggle with alcohol or drug problems annually. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is costly to our nation, exacting more than $428 billion in costs related to crime, lost work productivity and health care. While effective treatments exist, over half of those who enter treatment for substance use disorders drop out early in treatment and return to alcohol or drug abuse. The proposed research addresses this public health problem directly by testing an innovative approach to increasing treatment retention and reducing relapse among a diverse and underserved group of women.",NEURAL MECHANISMS IN WOMEN’S TREATMENT AND EARLY RECOVERY,9140042,R01DA038648,"['stressor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' race differences

"Stress and Unintended Pregnancy in Adolescence and Young Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent and young adult women in the U.S., especially racial/ethnic minority and poor young women, have high rates of early and unintended pregnancy, which are associated with a host of adverse outcomes. While proximal and distal determinants of fertility have been widely studied, little research has focused on the role of stress in unintended pregnancy.  Stress is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality and a key mechanism that links social context and health disparities. The biological and psychological processes of stress may affect the pathways to unintended pregnancy, but this has not been addressed in reproductive health research. Moreover, how social determinants of stress shape young women's risk of unintended pregnancy is unknown. To improve our knowledge of the complex, interrelated determinants of unintended pregnancy and to advance reproductive health scholarship at the intersection of biological and social processes (i.e. biosocial), this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award focuses on the important but understudied role of stress in unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood. So that I may conduct cutting-edge research in this area, I propose career development training to: 1) learn sociological theories, concepts, and methods for studying unintended pregnancy and stress; 2) build competency in bio demographic research methods and their application to fertility research; 3) attain a more nuanced understanding of the theory and research on the biology of stress and fecund ability; and 4) become proficient in advanced multilevel, longitudinal, and mediational statistical methods required for modeling the life course of and pathways between stress and unintended pregnancy. The corresponding K01 research project will: 1) estimate how trajectories of stress relate to unintended pregnancy; 2) investigate relationships between social determinants of stress (social stressors), stress trajectories, and unintended pregnancy; and 3) explore the biological processes (e.g., neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and immune) through which stress influences unintended pregnancy, during adolescence and young adulthood. To assist with the K01 training and research plans, I have assembled a strong multidisciplinary advisory board comprised of esteemed scholars, including mentor Jennifer Barber PhD, co-mentor Kathleen Mullan Harris PhD, scientific advisors Ana Diez Roux MD PhD, Timothy Johnson MD, and Julia Seng PhD MSN, and statistical consultant Yu Xie PhD. The University of Michigan Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Institute for Social Research and The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health and Carolina Population Center will provide the infrastructures to support these activities. This K01 will establish me as an independent investigator poised to conduct new biosocial studies of fertility and ultimately lead innovative, interdisciplinary research efforts to improve outcomes an reduce disparities in young women's reproductive health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood is a persistent public health problem with negative implications for young women, their offspring, and society. Stress, which is prevalent across the reproductive life course and is a contributor to morbidity, mortality, and health disparities, has been understudied in reproductive health research. Using an innovative, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary approach, this study will provide new insights into the biosocial processes of stress that shape the risk of unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood, and findings will help identify reproductive health services, programs, and policies to improve reproductive outcomes and reduce disparities among young women.",Stress and Unintended Pregnancy in Adolescence and Young Adulthood,9132832,K01HD080722,"['Miscarriage ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biology ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Gynecology ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender people are a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. They express their gender-variant identity in various ways and through a multitude of self- labels, both within and outside of binary conceptualizations of sex/gender as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine. While public awareness of this diversity has grown, our understanding of transgender people's experience is limited by a lack of systematic research on their identity development. Health inequities documented among the U.S. transgender population include depression (44%), suicidal ideation (54%) and attempts (31%), anxiety (33%), smoking (36%), and HIV infection (12% based on self- report; 28% on testing). Social stigma attached to gender nonconformity has been proposed as a major contributing factor to these health inequities. Previous research found that the vast majority of transgender individuals experienced discrimination. Much of the data, however, is limited by the use of small convenience samples of transgender women with a history of sex work, recruited from AIDS and social service agencies. The goal of this study is to move beyond these limitations by using purposive, venue-based sampling to recruit a broad, diverse sample of transgender people in 3 U.S. cities--New York, San Francisco, and Atlanta-and enroll them into a mixed-method longitudinal study to test an adaptation of the minority stress model, investigating vulnerability, risk and resilience in the context of identity development. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the process of transgender identity development based on qualitative lifeline interviews with a sample of 90 transgender individuals ages 16 and older, and identify periods of acute vulnerability and characteristics of resilience; (2) Informed by findings from Aim 1, to refine a model combining identity development, minority stress, and resilience, and to develop/adapt measures to assess the model's key constructs; (3) To test the model of resilience in a cohort of transgender individuals (N = 480) stratified by city, gender, and age, and follow them over time (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow up interviews); and (4) To triangulate qualitative and quantitative data on identity development and minority stress processes in order to inform the future development and testing of intervention strategies aimed at fostering resilience and reducing stigma and discrimination. By achieving these aims, this study will make a significant advance in scientific knowledge about gender identity development, minority stress processes (enacted stigma, felts stigma, concealment, shame and their impact on health and psychosocial adjustment), minority coping (on an individual as well as community level), and the development of resilience over time. The study is innovative in its focus on an understudied minority population, the application of the lifeline interview method to this population, and the adaptation and testing of the minority stress model within the context of transgender identity development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research to date has found inequities in mental health, substance use, HIV infection, and other health concerns among gender nonconforming people in the United States. This study takes a longitudinal, mixed- method approach to uncover the mechanism of how stigma and minority stress affect health and psychosocial development among this population, identifying periods of acute vulnerability and corresponding resilience. Findings will inform the development of future intervention strategies aimed at reducing stigma and promoting the health and wellbeing of this and other vulnerable populations.","Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse Populations",9115914,R01HD079603,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Homosexuals ', ' Interview ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Shame ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Service ', ' Social Work ', ' Stress ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Acute ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Series ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Feminine ', ' Masculine ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' psychosocial development ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender men ', ' transmen ', ' transman ', ' trans-men ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' Hormone use ', ' gender variant ', ' gender variance ', ' peer support ', ' family support ', ' gender diversity ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2016,575482,0.06362007634242797
"Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now large-scale epidemiological evidence that aspects of chronic psychological stress, such as early adversity or job strain, and early life stress, predict earlier disease onset and mortality. Despite documentation of the importance of stress to health, there are several critical barriers that prevent progress in the epidemiological study of stress as a risk factor for disease. Measurement of stress is inherently complex and multi-level (e.g., social, psychological, physiological). There are few agreed upon 'gold standard' measures of stress, hence measurement is often inconsistent and superficial where heterogeneous constructs are conflated. There is also little understanding of the conditions under which stress exposure can promote vulnerability vs. resiliency to disease. Meanwhile, there have been rapid advances in the basic science of stress processes, which have helped to unpack the cognitive and affective components, links to brain and peripheral physiological responses, and richer measures of daily stress - e.g., through ecological momentary assessments using technology to obtain detailed profiles of exposures and contexts. Thus, epidemiological stress science can benefit from a more coherent multilevel model that encompasses better measurement of lifespan exposures and responses, including the social, psychological, and physiological indices of stress that have the greatest impact on health. The proposed R24 will recruit excellent scientists with relevant methods to apply their interests to th advancement of stress measurement across human development, with a focus on how lifespan stress affects health in mid to late life. Aims include: 1) Development of a stress measurement taxonomy, including guidelines for best measurement; 2) Development of a 'toolbox' of short measures of stress that can be used in epidemiological studies of adult aging internationally. These will be drawn from innovative measurement from basic experimental and field research, refinement/shortening of existing measures, and results from comparative validation of promising measures; and 3) Promotion of stress research in epidemiological studies of aging, both through harmonizing existing measures and adding new toolbox measures. This in turn will lead to discoveries that refine the taxonomy and research methodologies. Improved stress measurement offers tremendous opportunities for advancing the field of basic research, enhancing the efficacy of health-promotion interventions and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic stress can impair health, but the mechanisms are not well known and the measures that investigators use are diverse and inconsistent. This network will promote better theory and new measures, and develop a ""stress measurement toolbox,"" that large-scale studies can use. This in turn will lead to a deeper understanding of how stress affects psychological well-being as well as disease etiology and progression, and ways to intervene.",Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement,9309632,R24AG048024,"['Link ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' validation studies ', ' Impaired health ', ' social ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Documentation ', ' Skin ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' comparative ', ' critical period ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' standard measure ', ' population health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' study population ', ' Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Au element ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' indexing ', ' intern ', ' Internships ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Paper ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Physiology ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R24,2016,150000,0.20250216544499441
"Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women are disproportionately affected by systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and also face worse consequences of disease activity. This proposed study is important to helping improve our understanding of how psychosocial stressors that are salient in the lives of African American women, and in particular experiences of racial discrimination, exacerbate SLE severity and progression. Accomplishing the specific aims of this research will help to unravel factors contributing to racial disparities in this understudied disease, and will also help to identify potential targets of intervention?",Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women,9370652,R01AR065493,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Linear Models ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Spottings ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' chronic autoimmune disease ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' Lupus ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' minimally invasive ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' longitudinal design ', ' social health determinants ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial minority ', ' racial identity ', ' ']",NIAMS,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R01,2016,510185,0.07630552075158208
"Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health problems are proportionately affect racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as populations that face chronic economic hardship (Evans, Wolf & Adler, 2012). There is clear evidence that (1) the processes that lay the groundwork for mental health disparities is laid during childhood (e.g., Chen & Miller, 2012) and (2) that damage to and dysregulation of the physiologic stress response is a powerful mechanism of the effects of chronic stress such as that associated with poverty on psychopathology (e.g., Evans & Kim, 2012). To contribute solutions to mental health disparities, we need interventions capable of affecting the systems that confer the risk. Since the psychobiologic stress response system (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis; HPA) is a central mechanism linking health disparities to chronic stress, the stress response is a critical system to target. Improving children's ability to cope with stress and regulate their reactivity ha the potential to break the cycle of damage, especially if the coping strategies and regulatory processes that we target have effects at the physiologic level. Preliminary evidence from the PIs research lab has emerged showing that different types of coping are evident at the level of the HPA-it is, therefore, time to evaluate whether a coping intervention designed for children facing chronic stress will both (a) improve children's ability to use primary and secondary control coping, and (b) have sustained effects at the physiologic level. We have developed just such an intervention, which builds on these exciting new findings and is designed to address core underlying mechanisms of risk and repair in the highly stressful context of poor, urban youths' lives.  Preadolescence is a crucial time during which children's ability to recognize stress and it causes matures, and repertoires for coping with stress grow in both size and complexity. In addition, preadolescence is a time of increased brain changes and growth in key self-regulatory organs and systems. Preadolescents are, therefore, at a ripe stage to benefit from coping-based prevention and the plasticity of this developmental period suggests that such changes have the potential to be long-lasting. Our new prevention program is designed to prevent the onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in preadolescent children facing chronic stress. Two mechanisms of action are targeted in this project. First, the project seeks to demonstrate that children facing chronic stress stemming from poverty, discrimination, and violence exposure can acquire and utilize new ways of coping that are adaptive in a wide variety of circumstances. Second, the project will examine the extent to which improved coping resulting from the intervention engages the physiologic intermediate mechanism of the HPA. Finally, the project aims to link changes in coping and the HPA to changes in internalizing symptoms that would signal prevention of the emergence of new or worsening of existing symptoms. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system that leads to psychopathology can offer new directions for combatting health disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and socioeconomic disparities in physical and mental health problems are large, persistent, and severe; begin during childhood; and stem from in part damage to physiologic stress response systems caused by chronic stress. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system may offer new directions for combatting health disparities. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a new prevention program designed to teach preadolescent children effective ways for coping with chronic stress that will have direct effects on their physiologic stress response systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and ultimately prevent onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms and disorders.                ",Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress,8955327,R21MH107631,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Wolves ', ' Exposure to ', ' Staging ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' showing emotion ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' empowered ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' preteen ', ' preadolescence ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' R21/R33 Program ', ' R21/R33 Mechanism ', ' Phased Innovation Awards ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' stem ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' intervention effect ', ' coping mechanism ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' violence victimization ', ' racial minority ', ' psychological symptom ', ' stress symptom ', ' ']",NIMH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R21,2016,522538,0.18156684209296528
"Interaction of Air Pollution and Psychosocial Stress on Cardiovascular Disease. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This proposal seeks to understand the interaction between air pollution and psychosocial stress on markers of inflammation and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). Under the mentorship of Dr. Joel Kaufman, this training and research plan will build upon Dr. Hajat's expertise in social epidemiology and prepare her for a career studying the nexus of social and environmental factors and their impact on CVD. During the K99 phase, Dr. Hajat will use didactic instruction and independent study to gain additional training in 1) the biology of stress and CVD 2) spatial statistical methods and 3) exposure generation and assessment. This training will provide Dr. Hajat with interdisciplinary skills and knowledge as she moves towards an independent research career. During the K99 phase Dr. Hajat will characterize the extent to which biomarkers of stress, neighborhood-level psychosocial stressors and individual level psychosocial stressors are spatially correlated with ambient air pollutants, specifically particulae matter <2.5 ¿m in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and black carbon. This work will build upon Dr. Hajat's previous work using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a longitudinal study of subclinical CVD in a cohort of older adults recruited from six metropolitan areas across the US. Upon completion of the training phase of this award, Dr. Hajat will undertake research during the R00 phase of the project that will transition her to an independent investigator. The aims of this research are (1) to assess the synergistic effects of air pollution and psychosocial stress (measured objectively and subjectively) on markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen) as well as on the progression of atherosclerosis in different vascular beds, measured by intima media thickness, coronary calcification and ankle brachial index and (2) to conduct a crossover study which exposes participants to both diesel exhaust (DE) from an inhalation facility and a laboratory-based mental stress test to assess the synergistic effect of both exposures on physiological outcomes such as blood pressure, heart rate variability, catecholamine levels and IL-6. The research in the R00 phase proposes epidemiologic studies of two complementary extant data sources, MESA and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional nationally representative sample of the US population. Both studies have data on air pollution, psychosocial stressors, inflammation and subclinical CVD and together capture a larger geographic area and populations across the life course. The R00 phase also proposes conducting an experimental study. The study will be conducted in one of the nation's few controlled inhalation facilities where subjects will be exposed to both DE and a laboratory generated acute mental stressor. The acute mental stress exposure, which is often used in psychology, will consist of administering a speech task and an arithmetic task. Understanding the synergistic effects of air pollution and psychosocial stress will help advance our understanding of the biological mechanisms behind environmental health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in rates of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the US, have been persistent for decades. New approaches to understanding the root causes of health disparities are needed if our nation wants to make progress towards alleviating these disparities and in so doing improving the public's health. This proposal will explore the joint effect of psychosocial stressors and an environmental hazard, air pollution, to better understand if together these factors contribute to precursors of

"Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors Project Summary/Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and debilitating age-related health condition contributing toward physical and psychosocial decline, reduced quality of life, and rising national expenses. Considerable evidence demonstrates health disparities in the burdens of living with OA. Specifically, African Americans with knee OA experience greater clinical pain, functional limitations, and decreased quality of life compared to non-Hispanic whites. Pain is a key factor contributing to functional limitations and physical disability. Psychosocial stress predicts the onset of chronic pain and living with chronic pain contributes to increased psychosocial stress. Ethnic groups differ in environmental and sociocultural stress exposures. Importantly, the body is designed to adapt and strengthen with adequate recovery in response stress. However, persistent stress can take a toll on the system resulting in dysregulation and dysfunction known as allostatic load. Persistent stress and chronic pain contribute toward altered functioning across multiple biological systems including the brain. Structural and functional changes and accelerated aging in the brain have been observed among individuals with chronic pain, including those with knee OA. Altered stress-related biological functioning has also been indicated in individuals with chronic pain. These biological changes likely contribute to increased morbidity and mortality among those with chronic pain and OA. What is not known however is whether: 1) African Americans and non- Hispanic whites with knee OA differ across biological measures of aging, 2) biological measures of aging are inter-related, and 3) biological measures of aging predict ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. Importantly, there is evidence that health promoting behaviors and psychosocial factors may modulate the biological consequences of OA-related pain and stress. We will investigate a comprehensive array of biopsychosocial measures across three time points in a four year longitudinal analysis of 200 adults with knee OA (100 African Americans and 100 non-Hispanic whites) to determine the influence of stress exposure on measures of biological aging (allostatic load, telomere length, and brain structure/function), and the relationship between biological measures of aging and ethnic group differences in knee OA health outcomes. We will also evaluate the possible modulating effect of risk and resilience factors. Findings will 1) contribute to an improved understanding of the stress, resilience, aging, and health outcome dynamic; 2) promote the identification of biological markers sensitive to stress related exposure and indicative of health- related system functioning; and 3) elucidate resilience factors that may serve as clinical targets to reduce ethnic group disparities in OA and improve overall health outcomes. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis is a prevalent and debilitating age-related condition that unequally burdens African American adults compared to non-Hispanic white adults. There is a gap in knowledge regarding the transition from stress exposure to disparities in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. The goal of this project is to investigate the trajectory from stress exposure to biological measures of aging and stress-related system dysregulation (allostatic load, telomere length, changes in brain structure/function) to ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes over a four year period. The long-term intention is to identify strategies to reduce the burden and improve health outcomes for adults with osteoarthritis.","Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors",9205914,R01AG054370,"['abstracting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Buffers ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Health ', ' Knee ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' age group ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostatic load ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biological systems ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' stress symptom ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2016,511038,-0.10155775256260328
"Longitudinal Perspectives on Race and Health in MIDUS: Insights from Milwaukee DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The MIDUS (Midlife in the U.S.) national longitudinal study included, at its second wave, a sample of African American adults from Milwaukee, WI, a high segregated U.S. city, to increase participation of minority respondents in clinic-based biological assessments. Numerous advances have been generated on the impact of psychosocial stress, including perceived discrimination, on health, well-being, and physiological risk factors. This revised application requests funds to conduct a longitudinal follow-up 9-10 years later on the Milwaukee sample to parallel longitudinal work currently underway on the main MIDUS sample. We hypothesize that Milwaukee African Americans compared to their White counterparts in MIDUS will show earlier age-related decline in health (chronic conditions, health symptoms, biological risk factors), health behaviors (physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol use) and cognitive capacities. Further we predict that race differences in longitudinal aging will be accounted for by differential environmental exposures (work/family stress, perceived discrimination) as well as more adverse experiences related to the economic recession. Exploiting the rich psychosocial assessments in MIDUS, we will investigate factors that moderate the impact of stress exposures on health. Such analyses will include vulnerability factors such as psychological distress (depression, anxiety, anger) hypothesized to exacerbate the adverse impact of environmental stress on health as well as resilience factors such as psychosocial strengths (purpose in life, sense of control, optimism, social ties) hypothesized to mitigate against such pernicious effects. The revised proposed distills the innovative features of the proposed research and offers novel analytic strategies to test key hypotheses. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing evidence suggests that age-related changes in health differ notably by such factors as income, educational status and race. This research will examine stress exposures in African Americans in the most segregated city in the U.S.: Milwaukee, WI, and compare them to Whites of similar economic and educational backgrounds. A key focus is on identifying factors that mitigate against poor health profiles in such contexts o adversity, so as to advance knowledge of protective resources that need to be more widely nurtured and promoted.",Longitudinal Perspectives on Race and Health in MIDUS: Insights from Milwaukee,9134590,R01AG047154,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Anxiety ', ' Archives ', ' Budgets ', ' Buffers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Economic Recession ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' Malaise ', ' insight ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' Respondent ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Clinic ', ' psychosocial ', ' Episodic memory ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Request for Applications ', ' Cognitive ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Self-Administered ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' aging effect ', ' age effect ', ' computerized ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Minority Participation ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2016,299999,0.11172984746094627
"Molecular Epidemiology of Oxidative Stress and Related Cancers in Black Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxidative stress is defined as an ""imbalance in pro-oxidants and antioxidants with associated disruption of redox circuitry and macromolecular damage"". Chronic oxidative stress is believed to increase the risk of many cancers such as breast and colorectal cancers. Despite being at increased risk of developing and dying from oxidative-stress related cancers, African-Americans are under-represented in population-based studies of oxidative stress and cancer. This is especially true for biomarker-based and nutritional epidemiology studies of oxidative stress. This career development award is designed to provide training and research experience to Dr. Dash to support his goal of becoming an independent researcher investigating the molecular epidemiology of cancers among minorities including cancer disparities. Proposed training plans include mentorship and coursework in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and exploratory data analysis, filling gaps in research training related to studies among minorities and health disparity studies, and research considerations in recruitment and bio specimen collection from minorities in epidemiologic research. The research component of the proposal aims to address the research gaps mentioned above by (1) characterizing the systemic oxidative stress burden via measurement of a panel of known biomarkers of oxidative stress using proteomics and metabolomics technologies; (2) identifying dietary patterns associated with oxidative stress; and (3) investigating the association of these dietary patterns with risk of breast and colorectal cancers among African- American women. The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involves measurement of a panel of 6 oxidative stress biomarkers using proteomic and metabolomic approaches and describing the oxidative stress burden among African-American women without cancer. Dietary patterns related to the biomarkers of oxidative stress will also be identified usin dietary intake data self-reported by participants on food frequency questionnaires. Phase 2 of the study involves investigating the association of the oxidative stress-related dietary patterns developed in Phase 1 with breast and colon cancer risk in a large, nationally-representative, cohort study of Black women. Results from the study will support larger and more definitive studies on oxidative stress and cancer among African-American women. The proposed research complements the training and mentorship plans in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and minority health research. With this award Dr. Chiranjeev Dash will combine his previous training in epidemiology with advanced training in metabolomics/proteomics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, and gain experience in conduct of minority health research to establish an independent research career focusing on translational research on the molecular epidemiology of oxidative stress in cancer causation and prevention.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses a priority area for the National Cancer Institute, minority health research and research to reduce cancer health disparities. This study focuses on studying the molecular epidemiology of oxidative stress and cancer among African-American women, an underserved minority group who have been under-represented in biomarker-based oxidative stress and cancer research. The study will provide data on the role of dietary patterns in oxidative stress and investigate whether oxidative stress-associated dietary patterns are associated with breast and colon cancer risk among African- American women.            ",Molecular Epidemiology of Oxidative Stress and Related Cancers in Black Women,9109122,K07CA197112,"['epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Antioxidants ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' Colo-rectal Neoplasms ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' L-Cysteine ', ' Half-Cystine ', ' Cysteine ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', "" 2'-deoxy-guanosine "", ' Deoxyguanosine ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing racial disparity in obesity has reached a critical juncture, particularly among black and white females. Obesity is now being perpetuated across generations. While there is uncertainty about how best to prevent obesity and the related racial disparities, converging lines of evidence support the influence of stress on obesity. We hypothesize that income and race are associated with higher levels of both objective and perceived stress, which in turn are associated with higher rates of dysregulated eating, a behavior posited to result in an increased rate of obesity. Finally, we propose that stress has a direct effect on the level of obesity in the offspring. We propose to model these relationships longitudinally using the National Growth and Healthy Study (NGHS) that enrolled equal numbers of black and white girls and that contains extensive measures of life stress, nonhomeostatic eating, household demographic and socioeconomic indicators and cardiometabolic risk factors for black and white girls initially sampled at age 10 and interviewed annually until age 20. We will extend these data, adding a new wave of data collection for the women who are now 36 and their children. We will interview participants regarding their current levels of stress, household food insecurity, dysregulated eating behaviors such as dietary restraint and overeating, and collect data on dietary intake and physical activity. We will collect measured weight and central adiposity and clinical measures of metabolic syndrome on both the women and their children. Building on the rich source of longitudinal data that NGHS provides, we will model relationships between these factors and weight status from early childhood to adulthood among these women and their children in order to examine the effects of cumulative stress, eating behaviors and obesity on obesity in the next generation. The study aims to test the hypotheses that: 1) stress and dysregulated eating results in an increased rate of obesity, exacerbated by food insecurity; 2) maternal stress and dysregulated eating have a direct effect on the level of obesity and markers of metabolic syndrome in offspring; and, 3) race and income are associated with higher levels of stress and dysregulated eating in women. Our preliminary data suggests that stress leads to excessive weight gain ten years later in the NGHS cohort. We will identify predictors of weight gain trajectories from childhood to adulthood. These constructs have the potential to lead to promising interventions coupled with traditional diet and physical activity components that will help girls and women throughout the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing black/white disparities and the perpetuation of obesity across generations has reached a critical juncture, particularly among girls and women. The current proposal seeks to add a new wave of data collection to survey participants regarding current stress factors, household food insecurity, and non-homeostatic eating such as restrained and drive to overeat and evaluate the relationships between these factors and weight gain trajectories in a longitudinal cohort of girls followed from age 10 to 36 years. We believe that this approach will identify modifiable stress-based factors that can be incorporated into intervention trials leading to sustained changes in children's and women's weight trajectories.","Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity",9097410,R01HD073568,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Data Collection ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Fat Body ', ' Female ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Mothers ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Weights and Measures ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' Body Measures ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Body fat ', ' Life ', ' Calories ', ' Source ', ' waist circumference ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' model organism ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Animal Model ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Dietary intake ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Data ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' Coupled ', ' 16 year old ', ' sixteen year old ', ' age 16 years ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' population based ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' cardio-metabolic risk ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' black/white disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2016,509982,0.055760971475478135
"Prenatal Pollution, Stress and Maternal-child Health: Role of Immunomodulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The goal of this Career Development Plan is to launch an independent research career in children's environmental health, specializing in climate change research, with a focus on the health vulnerabilities of children. Climate change will impact health by changing the landscape with respect to allergens, pollution, extreme storms, and thermal stress.

"Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women are disproportionately affected by systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and also face worse consequences of disease activity. This proposed study is important to helping improve our understanding of how psychosocial stressors that are salient in the lives of African American women, and in particular experiences of racial discrimination, exacerbate SLE severity and progression. Accomplishing the specific aims of this research will help to unravel factors contributing to racial disparities in this understudied disease, and will also help to identify potential targets of intervention?",Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women,9057958,R01AR065493,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Buffers ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Kidney ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' Linear Models ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Spottings ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Participant ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' chronic autoimmune disease ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' Lupus ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' minimally invasive ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' longitudinal design ', ' social health determinants ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial minority ', ' racial identity ', ' ']",NIAMS,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R01,2016,556880,0.07630552075158208
"Stress & Parenting in Blacks: Preventing Obesity in Youth to Reduce Cancer Risk DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity was a factor in over 16,000 cancer-related deaths in African-Americans (Blacks) in 2011. Blacks have the highest prevalence of obesity and cancer death rates of any group in the United States. Obesity and lifestyle behaviors related to increased cancer risks are often established during childhood, highlighting the importance of parenting behaviors in reducing obesity-related cancer risks. The proposed study examines the influence of coping in mitigating the effects of stress on caregiver behaviors that promote child obesity, fast food, fruit and vegetable consumption, activity and inactivity. The long term research objective is to develop an intervention for Black families to reduce obesity-related cancer risk in children. Stress, defined as the negative psychological response to events that are perceived as taxing, in Black adults is associated with haphazard meal planning and increased consumption of high-fat/high-sugar foods. Stress in parents/caregivers (here on referred to as ""caregivers"") is associated with child obesity, fast food consumption, and decreased vegetable intake. Differential use of coping styles in Blacks and Whites has been postulated as a cause for health disparities. There is evidence that compared with Whites, Blacks are more likely to use religious and culturally influenced coping. Both of these types of coping have aspects that either increase the risk of obesity (negative coping) or decrease the risk of obesity (positive coping). A mixed-methods design will be used to identify how stress and coping influence parenting behaviors that may be associated with child obesity. The research aims are: (1) to characterize the relationships among stress, coping skills and parenting behaviors of Black caregivers that promote child obesity; and (2) to measure the association of stress and culturally-influenced and religious coping styles with parenting behaviors of Black caregivers that promote child obesity. To accomplish these aims, first a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews will be used to characterize the influence of stress and coping on parenting related to child obesity in 48 caregivers of children ages 3-7 years. Second, a cross-sectional study will measure these relationships in 164 caregivers and their children ages 3-7 years. This study will be conducted in the Black church community to reflect the fact that 85% of Blacks consider themselves a part of Black church culture. These studies will inform future projects that develop and test interventions to prevent child obesity and future cancer risk. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African-Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with and suffer greater complications from cancer, often as a result of obesity, decreased physical activity  and poor nutrition. These behaviors that increase the risk of cancer often begin in childhood under the influence of parents. The goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of how stress and coping in African-American parents influence the physical activity and nutrition environments of their children, in order to gain insights about potential ways to prevent childhood obesity and the future development of cancer.",Stress & Parenting in Blacks: Preventing Obesity in Youth to Reduce Cancer Risk,9066115,K01CA160818,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' nutrient intake activity ', ' feeding-related behaviors ', ' Ingestive Behavior ', ' Feeding behaviors ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Interview ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Taxes ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Physical activity ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' sugar ', ' Measurement ', ' convenience food ', ' fast food ', ' Frequencies ', ' Event ', ' Church ', ' cancer complication ', ' cancer risk ', ' self reliance ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Reporting ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' parent influence ', ' parental influence ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Intake ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cancer Death Rates ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pediatric obesity ', ' obese children ', ' childhood obesity ', ' obesity in children ', ' food consumption ', ' feeding ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Obesity associated cancer ', ' Obesity related cancer ', ' coping ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Consumption ', ' obesity risk ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' stress reactivity ', ' ']",NCI,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,K01,2016,130860,0.0584506923796933
"Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to Non-Hispanic Whites, Black Americans carry a disproportionate burden of social risk factors for poor mental health, such as living in violent urban environments and experiencing economic deprivation and discrimination. Despite these risks, Black Americans have lower lifetime prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders than Whites. The reasons for Black Americans' resilience to these mental health disorders are unknown. This proposal aims to examine cumulative adversity and subsequent diminished neurobiological stress response as a possible explanation of Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and depression. It also aims to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying this resilience. These aims will be accomplished by conducting research interviews with 1,306 young adults (age 20-21; 60% Black, 40% White; 50% female) from an existing community sample who have been previously assessed three times during childhood and adolescence. These research interviews will provide information on adversity experienced by the participants, categorical diagnoses and dimensional measures of internalizing distress, and physiological indicators of reactivity to stress. Neural bases of stress response will be evaluated with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) for a subset of 120 Black and 120 White participants from the larger study. This study is innovative because it proposes to test a novel mechanism explaining the resilience of Black Americans to depression and anxiety, incorporates both categorical and dimensional measures of internalizing problems, and examines the role of physiological stress response and regulatory neural circuit in the resilience process. The results will have important implications for our understanding of racial disparities i anxiety and depression, neurobiological mechanisms underlying resilience to stress, and relationships between environmental stress, neural and physiological response, and negative affect. These findings will point to novel ways to diagnose and treat mental health problems in Black and White Americans. Black Americans are exposed to more adversity than White Americans, yet they experience lower rates of anxiety and depressive disorders. The proposed project investigates cumulative adversity and diminished neurobiological stress response as causal mechanisms underlying Black Americans' resilience to anxiety and mood disorders. The findings will improve our understanding of the role of adversity and neurobiological stress system in anxiety and depression and suggest novel approaches to diagnose and treat these mental health problems in Black and White Americans.",Neurobiological Mechanisms of Lower Internalizing Disorders in Black Americans,9070767,R01MH098348,"['teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' amygdaloid nuclear complex ', ' Amygdaloid Nucleus ', ' Amygdaloid Body ', ' Amygdala ', ' Amygdaloid structure ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Anxiety ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Electromyography ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Female ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Goals ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Interview ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Funding ', ' clinical Diagnosis ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Diagnostic ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Affective Disorders ', ' Mood Disorders ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' social ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' neural circuit ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' Brain region ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' resilience ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' stress reactivity ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NIMH,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2016,391285,0.05145127076230256
"NEURAL MECHANISMS IN WOMEN’S TREATMENT AND EARLY RECOVERY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychological stress is a causal factor in the pathogenesis of substance use disorder (SUD) and relapse risk. Low-income women report high levels of stress in SUD residential treatment stemming from significant economic and family stressors in addition to challenges adjusting to residential treatment demands. Unmanaged stress, especially in early stages of residential treatment, is a major concern because it can increase dropout. Dropout from residential treatment places women at risk of substance use relapse. A gap in knowledge persists regarding the use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) with racially and ethnically diverse low-income women with SUDs, especially regarding the efficacy of adapted MBIs for preventing residential dropout and decreasing relapse. The long-term goal of this application is to improve treatment outcomes in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women with SUDs by targeting stress, residential dropout, and relapse. We have fully adapted, developed, and pilot tested a novel MBI, Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery: Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention for Women (MBRP-W), that supports the needs of women in residential treatment. It showed promising results in substance use and perceived stress outcomes and no racial or ethnic differences in outcomes. This MBI integrates relapse prevention, addresses literacy level, and is relevant to issues surrounding treatment- and relapse-related stressors of disadvantaged women. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to test the efficacy of MBRP-W on residential treatment (a) retention and (b) substance use relapse in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women to determine; (2) the mechanisms of change underlying the MBRP-W program; and (3) if changes in hair cortisol as a marker of chronic stress provide a more powerful measure of stress compared to self- reported stress as a mechanism of change. A rationale for MBRP-W is the need for self-initiated stress management skills in women with SUDs during the early stressful periods of residential treatment that increase risk of dropout and relapse. The unique strengths of this application are its focus on underserved populations, residential dropout, and relapse outcomes, and the first-ever inclusion of a chronic stress biomarker in MBI research in the form of hair cortisol. The proposed work is innovative in that it intends to reduce stress in women to improve both retention and relapse outcomes. The expected results will define a viable integrative treatment that can improve stress management skills and treatment outcomes and will evaluate the utility of a biomarker of chronic stress. Results of this study will have a positive impact on substance use recovery outcomes in diverse groups of low-income women and identify mechanisms of action to inform future SUD treatment. The project's public health impact meets NIDA goals because it intends to prevent the escalation of addiction and its health consequences by offering a novel treatment accessible to undeserved women that is expected to decrease addiction-related racial and ethnic and gender-based health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 25 million Americans struggle with alcohol or drug problems annually. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is costly to our nation, exacting more than $428 billion in costs related to crime, lost work productivity and health care. While effective treatments exist, over half of those who enter treatment for substance use disorders drop out early in treatment and return to alcohol or drug abuse. The proposed research addresses this public health problem directly by testing an innovative approach to increasing treatment retention and reducing relapse among a diverse and underserved group of

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of Stress Coping Behaviors Abstract There are wide variations in behavioral responses to social stress. Some individuals successfully employ coping strategies in response to stress, and become resilient. In others, social stress can precipitate psychiatric dysfunction, such as depression and anxiety. While coping mechanisms are known to be crucial for the maintenance of healthy mental functioning and a proper, successful coping strategy decreases the impact of stress and protects from long-term pathological states, there is less known about the neurophysiological basis of how this occurs. Importantly, it is clinically evident that vulnerability to stress-induced neuropsychiatric diseases is highly individual and may in part depend on these coping style. Human studies suggest that passive coping during stressful life events is associated with the development of stress-induced depression, whereas proactive coping is correlated with resiliency. Interestingly, males and females demonstrate different social stress coping strategies, suggesting potentially non-overlapping neural circuitry adaptations occurring in response to stress. Despite these clear gender differences and the increased incidence of major depression in females, translational work in this field has focused primarily on males. Identifying the neurobiological gender differences in stress coping responses may inform greatly needed mechanistically driven therapeutics for depression. The animal models proposed in this award will provide crucial mechanistic and neural circuit understanding of stress coping strategies influence on the stress response. Vulnerability to stress-induced diseases is highly individual and may in part depend on variable coping styles. Following repeated stress, there is increased arousal, expectancy and anxiety. It is these functions that facilitate coping at the circuit level, therefore our work focuses on those related brain regions. Recent studies have revealed the critical and opposing roles of the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Furthermore, the BNST projects to and regulates the firing of dopaminergic cells via GABAergic interneurons within the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region which has been shown to be linked to stress-related depressive phenotype. Thus the VTA projecting BNST neurons are uniquely positioned to receive stress axis information and integrate it into reward/motivation circuitry. The two specific aims outlined this proposal will fully characterize these behavioral models and identify neurophysiological changes that occur within the BNST-VTA pathway Research leading towards further understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of active stress coping strategies, and how they can enhance resistance to stress induced depression may provide novel pharmacological targets to enhance coping skills and reverse depressive symptoms. In summary, the research proposed in this Support of Competitive Research Pilot Project Award (SC2) is critical for the development of my independent research path. This mechanism will provide the financial, and mentorship support for the next steps in my career at Hunter College at the City University of New York.   Relevance statement Stress induced depression has a tremendous negative impact on the health of the individual and society. The research generated in this proposal will investigate a discrete neural circuit that mediates differential responses to stress, dependent on sex and coping strategy. These data will shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the differences in stress response in males and females and may lead to the development of potential targeted therapeutics to treat depression.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of Stress Coping Behaviors,9278487,SC2GM122646,"['Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cities ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Interneurons ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' New York ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' avoidance behavior ', ' career ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Dopaminergic Cell ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' reward circuitry ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' resilience ', ' Expectancy ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' translational study ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' neuroadaptation ', ' neural adaptation ', ' coping mechanism ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' mental function ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender disparity ', ' ']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,SC2,2017,156000,0.09509726471830685
"Orexins contribute to sex differences in habituation to stress and cognitive function ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, are serious mental illnesses that occur twice as frequently in women compared to men. Despite this disparity, we do not understand the biological basis of these sex differences. Human studies have revealed differences in the levels of the neuropeptides orexins in anxious and depressed patients compared to controls. Additionally, animal studies have revealed that orexins contribute to the stress response and to anxiety-like behavior. We have obtained preliminary data indicating orexins are differentially expressed in the brains of male and female rats. Consistent with previous research, we found that female rats exhibit a higher hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis response to repeated stress compared with males. Furthermore, females exhibited a stress-related impairment in cognitive flexibility but males did not. Therefore, we hypothesize that this sex difference in orexin expression contributes to the exacerbated stress response and poorer stress-related cognitive flexibility in female rats. The proposed research aims to elucidate how orexins contribute to sex differences in the stress response at both a single cell and behavioral level. Specifically, Aim 1 of this proposal will use in vitro electrophysiology to determine if sex differences are observed i the membrane and firing properties of orexin neurons before and after stress. Morphology of orexin neurons in males and females will also be examined using Neurolucida neuron tracing software. Aim 2 will directly test the hypothesis that increased orexin expression mediates the higher stress response and poorer stress-related cognitive flexibility. We will use DREADDS (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) technology to manipulate orexin action during stress. We expect that inhibition of orexin neurons in females will decrease the stress response and improve subsequent cognitive function. These experiments provide the first evidence linking orexins to sex differences in stress and cognition, but these results will also have immediate implications for treatment. Orexin antagonists are currently used to treat insomnia, so it is crucial we understand how these neuropeptides differ between males and females, as there may be a future need to develop sex-specific guidelines in dosing. Moreover, orexins may regulate stress responses, food intake, autonomic responses, and emotional memory and thereby contribute to a variety of psychiatric symptoms. In this way, targeting orexins may treat a broad range of psychiatric symptoms in a sex specific manner. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women are twice as likely to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, however, the neurobiological basis underlying this sex difference is unknown. The proposed research could provide the first strong evidence demonstrating that the neuropeptide orexin contributes to sex differences in stress and cognition. This project will have immediate implications for treatment, as orexin antagonists are currently used to treat insomnia; given the broad effects of orexins, targeting orexins may treat a broad range of psychiatric symptoms in a sex specific manner.",Orexins contribute to sex differences in habituation to stress and cognitive function,9474432,F32MH109269,"['suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adrenal Glands ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Cognition ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' In Vitro ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Patients ', ' Pituitary Gland ', ' Pituitary Nervous System ', ' Pituitary ', ' Hypophysis Cerebri ', ' Hypophysis ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' biotinyl L lysine ', ' biocytin ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Whole-Cell Recordings ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Morphology ', ' restraint ', ' cognitive function ', ' Viral ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' stress related disorder ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' acute stress ', ' Emotional ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Dendritic Spines ', ' dendrite spine ', ' Sleeplessness ', ' Insomnia Disorder ', ' Insomnia ', ' behavioral habituation ', ' hypocretin ', ' orexin ', ' hypocretins/orexins ', ' hypocretin/orexin ', ' Hcrts/ORXs ', ' Hcrt/ORX ', ' Hcrt protein ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cognitive performance ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' anxiety-related behavior ', ' anxious ', ' habituation ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' depressed patient ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,F32,2017,182,0.10700126256374863
"Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender people are a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. They express their gender-variant identity in various ways and through a multitude of self- labels, both within and outside of binary conceptualizations of sex/gender as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine. While public awareness of this diversity has grown, our understanding of transgender people's experience is limited by a lack of systematic research on their identity development. Health inequities documented among the U.S. transgender population include depression (44%), suicidal ideation (54%) and attempts (31%), anxiety (33%), smoking (36%), and HIV infection (12% based on self- report; 28% on testing). Social stigma attached to gender nonconformity has been proposed as a major contributing factor to these health inequities. Previous research found that the vast majority of transgender individuals experienced discrimination. Much of the data, however, is limited by the use of small convenience samples of transgender women with a history of sex work, recruited from AIDS and social service agencies. The goal of this study is to move beyond these limitations by using purposive, venue-based sampling to recruit a broad, diverse sample of transgender people in 3 U.S. cities--New York, San Francisco, and Atlanta-and enroll them into a mixed-method longitudinal study to test an adaptation of the minority stress model, investigating vulnerability, risk and resilience in the context of identity development. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the process of transgender identity development based on qualitative lifeline interviews with a sample of 90 transgender individuals ages 16 and older, and identify periods of acute vulnerability and characteristics of resilience; (2) Informed by findings from Aim 1, to refine a model combining identity development, minority stress, and resilience, and to develop/adapt measures to assess the model's key constructs; (3) To test the model of resilience in a cohort of transgender individuals (N = 480) stratified by city, gender, and age, and follow them over time (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow up interviews); and (4) To triangulate qualitative and quantitative data on identity development and minority stress processes in order to inform the future development and testing of intervention strategies aimed at fostering resilience and reducing stigma and discrimination. By achieving these aims, this study will make a significant advance in scientific knowledge about gender identity development, minority stress processes (enacted stigma, felts stigma, concealment, shame and their impact on health and psychosocial adjustment), minority coping (on an individual as well as community level), and the development of resilience over time. The study is innovative in its focus on an understudied minority population, the application of the lifeline interview method to this population, and the adaptation and testing of the minority stress model within the context of transgender identity development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research to date has found inequities in mental health, substance use, HIV infection, and other health concerns among gender nonconforming people in the United States. This study takes a longitudinal, mixed- method approach to uncover the mechanism of how stigma and minority stress affect health and psychosocial development among this population, identifying periods of acute vulnerability and corresponding resilience. Findings will inform the development of future intervention strategies aimed at reducing stigma and promoting the health and wellbeing of this and other vulnerable populations.","Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse populations",9448589,R01HD079603,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Homosexuals ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Shame ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Acute ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Series ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Feminine ', ' Masculine ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' psychosocial development ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' public health relevance ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender men ', ' transmen ', ' transman ', ' trans-men ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' Hormone use ', ' gender variant ', ' gender variance ', ' peer support ', ' family support ', ' gender diversity ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,116294,0.06362007634242797
"Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors Project Summary/Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and debilitating age-related health condition contributing toward physical and psychosocial decline, reduced quality of life, and rising national expenses. Considerable evidence demonstrates health disparities in the burdens of living with OA. Specifically, African Americans with knee OA experience greater clinical pain, functional limitations, and decreased quality of life compared to non-Hispanic whites. Pain is a key factor contributing to functional limitations and physical disability. Psychosocial stress predicts the onset of chronic pain and living with chronic pain contributes to increased psychosocial stress. Ethnic groups differ in environmental and sociocultural stress exposures. Importantly, the body is designed to adapt and strengthen with adequate recovery in response stress. However, persistent stress can take a toll on the system resulting in dysregulation and dysfunction known as allostatic load. Persistent stress and chronic pain contribute toward altered functioning across multiple biological systems including the brain. Structural and functional changes and accelerated aging in the brain have been observed among individuals with chronic pain, including those with knee OA. Altered stress-related biological functioning has also been indicated in individuals with chronic pain. These biological changes likely contribute to increased morbidity and mortality among those with chronic pain and OA. What is not known however is whether: 1) African Americans and non- Hispanic whites with knee OA differ across biological measures of aging, 2) biological measures of aging are inter-related, and 3) biological measures of aging predict ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. Importantly, there is evidence that health promoting behaviors and psychosocial factors may modulate the biological consequences of OA-related pain and stress. We will investigate a comprehensive array of biopsychosocial measures across three time points in a four year longitudinal analysis of 200 adults with knee OA (100 African Americans and 100 non-Hispanic whites) to determine the influence of stress exposure on measures of biological aging (allostatic load, telomere length, and brain structure/function), and the relationship between biological measures of aging and ethnic group differences in knee OA health outcomes. We will also evaluate the possible modulating effect of risk and resilience factors. Findings will 1) contribute to an improved understanding of the stress, resilience, aging, and health outcome dynamic; 2) promote the identification of biological markers sensitive to stress related exposure and indicative of health- related system functioning; and 3) elucidate resilience factors that may serve as clinical targets to reduce ethnic group disparities in OA and improve overall health outcomes. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis is a prevalent and debilitating age-related condition that unequally burdens African American adults compared to non-Hispanic white adults. There is a gap in knowledge regarding the transition from stress exposure to disparities in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. The goal of this project is to investigate the trajectory from stress exposure to biological measures of aging and stress-related system dysregulation (allostatic load, telomere length, changes in brain structure/function) to ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes over a four year period. The long-term intention is to identify strategies to reduce the burden and improve health outcomes for adults with osteoarthritis.","Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors",9353269,R01AG054370,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Buffers ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Health ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostatic load ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biological systems ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' stress symptom ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2017,490451,-0.10155775256260328
"Projection-specific gene expression in resilience to chronic stress Project Summary Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects ~4% of the worldwide population, and these numbers are continuously increasing. Moreover, MDD disproportionately affects women, who are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with the disease. Thus, uncovering the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms underlying susceptibility and resilience to depression is critical. Recent work demonstrates that ventral hippocampal (vHPC) projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulate mood and susceptibility to stress. Our group has shown that the transcription factor ΔFosB is crucial for hippocampal cell morphology and learning, and several lines of evidence implicate hippocampal ΔFosB in depressive-like behaviors (e.g., FosB knockout mice have hippocampal malformations and depressive behaviors, and current antidepressants induce ΔFosB in vHPC). However, to date there is no study characterizing the role of hippocampal ΔFosB in stress resilience and depression. To this end, we have produced a novel dual-virus CRISPR-Cas9 system allowing knockout of FosB gene expression specifically in vHPC cells projecting to the NAc. In combination with our many well-vetted molecular, physiological, and behavioral tools and models, this will allow us to address the central hypothesis that ΔFosB expression in vHPC neurons projecting to NAc mediates cell function and resilience to social stress in male and female mice. To test this hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims. In Aim I, we will first characterize the epigenetic mechanisms of induction of the FosB gene in hippocampus by chronic stress, determine its role in resilience to stress in both males and females, and uncover its transcriptional targets in vHPC. Indeed, our preliminary data show that inhibition of ΔFosB in vHPC induces susceptibility to depression-like symptoms. In Aim II, we will examine the stress induction and cellular effects of ΔFosB in vHPC neurons with projections to various brain regions, including NAc, then use our novel dual-virus system to knock down FosB gene expression specifically in vHPC cells projecting to the NAc and observe the behavioral results on stress responses. Here, too, we have strong preliminary data suggesting that ΔFosB regulates the excitability of vHPC neurons, and that ΔFosB expression in the vHPC- NAc projection cells regulates susceptibility to depression. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the critical role of ΔFosB in stress-induced changes in hippocampal control of limbic circuitry of both males and females, as well as identify novel ΔFosB targets that could serve as potential points for sex-specific therapeutic intervention in depression or PTSD. Stressful and traumatic experiences can contribute to mood disorders in some individuals while others are resilient to this process, and though we know that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in stress responses, there is a critical gap in our knowledge of how changes in hippocampal gene expression may drive resilience to stress. The proposed work seeks to delineate the role of ΔFosB, a transcription factor induced by stress, in the changes in gene transcription and cell physiology of hippocampal neurons that project to specific brain targets to mediate resilience to stress. This work is relevant to NIMH’s high priority interest in research utilizing sex as a biological variable and investigating mental health disparities, and utilizes innovative techniques to uncover basic pathophysiology that may be exploited as novel therapeutic interventions in major depressive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder.",Projection-specific gene expression in resilience to

"Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understand Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now large-scale epidemiological evidence that aspects of chronic psychological stress, such as early adversity or job strain, and early life stress, predict earlier disease onset and mortality. Despite documentation of the importance of stress to health, there are several critical barriers that prevent progress in the epidemiological study of stress as a risk factor for disease. Measurement of stress is inherently complex and multi-level (e.g., social, psychological, physiological). There are few agreed upon 'gold standard' measures of stress, hence measurement is often inconsistent and superficial where heterogeneous constructs are conflated. There is also little understanding of the conditions under which stress exposure can promote vulnerability vs. resiliency to disease. Meanwhile, there have been rapid advances in the basic science of stress processes, which have helped to unpack the cognitive and affective components, links to brain and peripheral physiological responses, and richer measures of daily stress - e.g., through ecological momentary assessments using technology to obtain detailed profiles of exposures and contexts. Thus, epidemiological stress science can benefit from a more coherent multilevel model that encompasses better measurement of lifespan exposures and responses, including the social, psychological, and physiological indices of stress that have the greatest impact on health. The proposed R24 will recruit excellent scientists with relevant methods to apply their interests to th advancement of stress measurement across human development, with a focus on how lifespan stress affects health in mid to late life. Aims include: 1) Development of a stress measurement taxonomy, including guidelines for best measurement; 2) Development of a 'toolbox' of short measures of stress that can be used in epidemiological studies of adult aging internationally. These will be drawn from innovative measurement from basic experimental and field research, refinement/shortening of existing measures, and results from comparative validation of promising measures; and 3) Promotion of stress research in epidemiological studies of aging, both through harmonizing existing measures and adding new toolbox measures. This in turn will lead to discoveries that refine the taxonomy and research methodologies. Improved stress measurement offers tremendous opportunities for advancing the field of basic research, enhancing the efficacy of health-promotion interventions and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic stress can impair health, but the mechanisms are not well known and the measures that investigators use are diverse and inconsistent. This network will promote better theory and new measures, and develop a ""stress measurement toolbox,"" that large-scale studies can use. This in turn will lead to a deeper understanding of how stress affects psychological well-being as well as disease etiology and progression, and ways to intervene.",Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understand Aging,9391884,R24AG048024,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' indexing ', ' Internships ', ' intern ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Paper ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' validation studies ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Impaired health ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' comparative ', ' critical period ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' standard measure ', ' population health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' study population ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R24,2017,106759,0.1939187416217695
"Minority Stress Reactivity and Hazardous Drinking PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disparities in hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been documented across several disadvantaged groups (e.g., racial/ethnic and sexual minorities). Hazardous drinking and its consequences are a major public health priority and concern given their significant economic, mortality, and morbidity burdens. Stigma and discrimination-related stressors (i.e., minority stressors) contribute to our understanding of health disparities among these groups. Given the importance of minority stressors in predicting hazardous drinking, the research aims of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) are to conduct a rigorous, innovative, and multi-method examination of minority stress and its effects on drinking in the lab and the natural environment among one disadvantaged health disparities group. Sexual minority (SM; i.e., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) adults are at increased risk for hazardous drinking compared to heterosexuals. SMs experience minority stressors, which range from daily and momentary slights to more acute forms of stigma, and are directly correlated with hazardous drinking. However, major limitations of the extant SM literature include the lack of objective measures of reactivity to minority stressors (i.e., biological markers), overreliance on cross-sectional data, and failure to account for individual differences in appraisals of minority stress or the contributions of minority stress on hazardous drinking beyond individual differences in daily general stress and lifetime cumulative stress. In addition, little is known about mediating mechanisms between minority stress and hazardous drinking. Consistent with Institute of Medicine and NIH’s call to expand the scientific knowledge base on factors contributing to SMs’ elevated rates of drinking, the research aims of this K08 are to: 1) examine the effects of psychophysiological mechanisms underpinning appraised minority stress and alcohol craving in a lab experiment of 70 SMs who are at most risk for developing AUD (i.e., heavy drinkers); and 2) use experience sampling methods (i.e., EMA) over a 30-day period, to examine: a) the effects of psychophysiological stress reactivity from the lab on minority stress reactivity and drinking in the natural environment and b) the prospective effects of minority stress on proximal changes in affect and drinking and its consequences in real time. While conducting this research and participating in several training and mentorship activities, the K08 candidate will develop new expertise in: 1) experimental laboratory research; 2) psychophysiological stress research and salivary research methodology; 3) experience sampling field methods (i.e., EMA); and 4) advanced statistical approaches for analyzing intensive longitudinal EMA quantitative data and physiological salivary laboratory data. This proposed project builds upon the candidate’s past work examining the associations between minority stressors and health outcomes among sexual and racial/ethnic minorities. Completion of this K08 award will provide the candidate necessary skills to be an independent researcher capable of advancing our knowledge of stress-specific factors predicting hazardous drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Sexual minorities (SMs; i.e., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) are at increased risk for hazardous drinking, alcohol- related consequences, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) than heterosexuals. Hazardous drinking and its consequences are a major public health concern given resulting economic, societal, mortality, and morbidity burdens. The project will address how SMs’ experiences with stigma-based stressors related to their sexual orientation (i.e., minority stressors) are associated with hazardous drinking in order to inform and develop alcohol interventions and improve the well-being of SMs.",Minority Stress Reactivity and Hazardous Drinking,9385841,K08AA025011,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' Award ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' System ', ' alcohol craving ', ' ethanol craving ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' drinking ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' alcohol intervention ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' alcohol related consequences ', ' public health priorities ', ' sexual minority ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' lab experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' prospective test ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' ']",NIAAA,AMERICAN UNIVERSITY,K08,2017,169287,0.054046268566919894
"Improving maternal and child health through prenatal fatty acid supplementation: A randomized controlled study in African American women living in low-income urban environments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnant women living in poverty often experience chronic stress and consequently higher levels of stress hormones. In utero exposure to high levels of stress hormones can negatively affect the developing fetus and the infant's capacity for emotion and behavioral regulation. In this application we describe a developing program of research designed to reduce the negative impact of prenatal stress on infant health and development via nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy. DHA is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member of the omega-3 fatty acid family. DHA is found in its highest concentrations in neural cell membranes, affecting receptor function, neurotransmitter uptake, and signal transmission. There is growing evidence that low levels of dietary DHA intake are associated with suboptimal response to stress and that DHA supplementation can modulate stress response. Aims: The goals of the proposed study are to test whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy is associated with 1) improved maternal health during pregnancy among African American women living in urban poverty; 2) improved infant birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and 3) whether the association between DHA supplementation during pregnancy and infant outcomes is partially mediated by reductions in maternal perceived stress and stress reactivity during pregnancy. Approach: One hundred sixty-two pregnant African American women living in urban poverty, who consume less than two servings of fish per week, will be randomly assigned to receive 450 mg/daily of DHA or placebo beginning at 9-12 weeks of gestation through the end of pregnancy. Perceived stress, stressful life events, anxiety, and depression, inflammatory markers, DHA levels and response to a laboratory stressor will be assessed at baseline and at 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes (e.g., gestational age, birth weight, delivery complications) will be collected from medical records, and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress reactivity will be assessed at 1, 4 and 9 months of age. Investigators: This application builds on a recently completed NICHD/NIMH funded R21 (PI: Keenan), which yielded preliminary evidence that DHA supplementation during pregnancy reduces perceived stress and cortisol response to stress in pregnant African American women living in low-income, urban environments. Drs. Keenan and Hipwell and Ms. Wroblewksi were investigators on the R21 and will continue to work together on the proposed study. Dr. Della Torre is an Assistant Professor of Obstetrics at the University of Chicago, who specializes in providing clinical services to African American women living in the south side of Chicago. Innovation: This will be the first large randomized controlled study of the effect of DHA supplementation in pregnant African American women living in urban poverty on maternal and infant health and stress response. Impact: If DHA supplementation is associated with reductions in perceived stress, more modulated maternal cortisol response to stress, and more optimal emotional and behavioral regulation in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program of research on the mechanisms by which these associations evolve can be launched and broad-based prevention interventions that target maternal and child in vulnerable populations can be implemented, potentially leading to reductions health disparities in the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of the effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in pregnant women living in urban, low-income environments on stress regulation during pregnancy. If essential fatty acid supplementation is associated with reductions in the experience of stress, more modulated biological response to stress, and more optimal stress regulation and neurodevelopment in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program on the mechanisms by which nutrition reduces the negative impact on prenatal stress on the offspring can be launched. This study may be the first step toward broad-based prevention of suboptimal birth and developmental outcomes among children born to African American women living in poverty.            ",Improving

"Biomarkers of Health Risk Among African American Couples ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation (INF) predicts the onset of chronic, age-related diseases. Although psychosocial stress is a major determinant of INF, we know little about the role of stress contagion from romantic partners, a prominent social context in early adulthood, or the role of childhood stressors in amplifying INF response to adult stress. Evidence has accumulated indicating that early stress experiences may shift propensity to respond with INF due to early calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR). However, we have little information regarding the extent to which IRTR predicts amplified INF response to adult stressors or the extent which it accounts for the impact of early stressors on INF. In addition, we do not know the extent to which persistent, supportive relationships in young adulthood have the potential to ameliorate the impact of earlier stressors by modifying IRTR and so reducing INF in response to adult stressors. Finally, prior research has largely focused on White samples, thereby limiting our understanding of the causes of INF among African Americans, a group at elevated risk for age- related chronic illness. This application seeks funding to add assessment of romantic partners and to directly assess IRTR for both targets and partners who are participating in a recently funded application. In the parent application we assess INF and collect telephone interview data from targets regarding stress and health behaviors in a sample of roughly 700 African Americans (now 28 years of age). In the current application we add parallel interview assessments and assessment of INF for N = 320 romantic partners. In addition we add assessment of IRTR for both targets and romantic partners. This additional data collection will allow us to address the following specific aims: 1) Identify the effect of stress contagion on young adult INF among African Americans, controlling for own stressors and history of early exposure to stressors; 2) Test hypothesized amplification of effect on INF of own stress, stress contagion, and dyad-level effects due to exposure to early stressors, and examine the hypothesis that calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR) is the mechanism by which early stress influences INF; and 3) Test the hypothesized role of persistent supportive romantic relationships (PSR) in ""recalibrating"" stress biology, i.e., examine the hypothesis that among those in persistent supportive relationships in young adulthood we will see reduced impact of early stress exposure on IRTR. The Institute of Medicine prescribes development of prevention based on longitudinal, epidemiological research with target populations. Currently, no prospective investigations identify the protective factors that interrup the impact of stress on INF for African Americans. The results of the proposed research will identify protective processes and serve as the basis for empirically- based, health disparities prevention programs as well as provide a basis for ongoing policy discussions, e.g. the Healthy Marriage Initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving quality of longer lives requires information about sources of the inflammation linked to age- related, chronic diseases; causes that include social relationships and may lie at earlier stages of development.

This application is being submitted in response to PAR-16-355, Social Epigenomics Research Focused on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R01), and the overarching long-term goal of this research effort is to learn how to positively influence health trajectories, modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for obesity in youth. Obesity was selected as the primary health outcome as it is a health measure with widening racial/ethnic disparities over the past three decades, and it is a potent predictor of a host of negative social, educational, vocational, and health outcomes later in life. In this study we propose to leverage two ongoing prenatal cohorts in Florida and North Carolina, and recruit a sample of 470 pregnant women and follow their children to 24 months of age. The sample will be enriched for adversity in pregnancy and approximately evenly divided among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic subjects. We will assess the impact of mothers' prenatal stress on measures of DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which are homogenous in terms of cellular composition, and widely accepted as an optimal choice for examining in utero responses to stressors. In the epigenetic analyses we will use both targeted and big data approaches, using pyrosequencing to measure methylation of 31 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate ~90 known imprinted genes, and the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC (850k) bead chip for whole epigenome analyses. We will also assess maternal and child postnatal psychosocial stress exposure, and child growth in the first 24 months of life. Children who are overweight at any point during the first two years of life have an approximately six-fold increased risk for obesity at five years of age, and risk for chronic health problems across the lifecycle. The primary hypotheses of this study build on preliminary work from our group and include: 1) Maternal prenatal stress will be associated with increased DMRs regulating the expression of imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) DMR, increased methylation in Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CAMK4) gene, and methylation changes in novel CpG sites identified in the 850K analyses; 2) DNA methylation profile changes associated with prenatal stress will be related to alterations in gene expression; and 3) Methylation markers identified in Aim 1 will predict growth trajectories and measures of obesity at 24 months of age. Secondary analyses will examine several moderating factors, including: maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), maternal social supports, maternal postnatal psychosocial distress, postnatal offspring ACE, genetic variants, and relevant confounding variables. The mediating role of inflammatory markers will also be explored, and saliva DNA specimens will be collected on the full cohort at 24-months and 50 children at birth, allowing for tests of comparability of DNA methylation between HUVECs and saliva, and the stability of markers over time. Project Narrative. Chronic exposure to psychosocial stress often accompanies the experience of poverty and racial/ethnic minority status, and may be causally related to health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for negative health outcomes to learn how to best modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce health disparities.","Social adversities, epigenetics, and the obesity epidemic",9387090,R01MD011746,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' youngster

"Epigenetic Mediation of Adverse Social Context on Stress Response, Socioemotional Development, and Health in a Population-based Study of Minority and Low SES Children and Adolescents Project Abstract Pronounced disparities exist by race, ethnicity, and SES in children and adolescents across a range of health conditions, and many adult health disparities can be traced to childhood social contextual inequalities. Epigenetics—modifications to the genome that are not changes in nucleotide sequence—holds great promise as potential indicators of contextual effects and health condition, potentially uncovering health disparities long before they are normally observable. Building on an existing representative study of children, this proposal will directly respond to PAR-16-355 by: 1) assembling epigenome-wide data on 2,000 children at two points in time, 2) describing methylation patterns in 3 race/ethnic groups and across SES levels, and 3) explicating epigenetic associations with social adversity, biological processes, and socioemotional development. The overarching hypothesis is that DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, DHEA levels) and stress responsive behaviors (behavioral problems, risk taking, and resilience). We further hypothesize both differential exposure and differential response to adversity by race/ethnicity and SES explains some of the disparity in stress response and socioemotional development—thereby requiring formal comparisons of race/ethnicity and SES in the same study. To conduct this research we utilize the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS): a 20-city nationally and city representative sample of 4898 children born in 1998- 2000. FFCW provides a uniquely high prevalence of non-Hispanic Black (47%), Hispanic (27%), and impoverished families, making the data particularly useful for studying race/ethnic and SES differences. Families were interviewed at birth and at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15—with biological data collected at ages 9 and 15. The expected results will be to provide estimates of: 1) population-based epigenome-wide DNA methylation measures for 3 race/ethnic groups (Hispanic n=600, African ancestry n=980, European ancestry n=420) in childhood and adolescence, 2) associations of social adversity across development (from in utero to age 15) with DNA methylation, 3) associations between DNA methylation and biological measures of stress response (i.e. telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, and DHEA levels), 4) associations between development of stress response behaviors and methylation profiles, and 5) comparisons of all these relationships in 3 race/ethnic groups and across a wide range of SES.  Project Narrative This proposal examines if DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and

"Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health problems are proportionately affect racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as populations that face chronic economic hardship (Evans, Wolf & Adler, 2012). There is clear evidence that (1) the processes that lay the groundwork for mental health disparities is laid during childhood (e.g., Chen & Miller, 2012) and (2) that damage to and dysregulation of the physiologic stress response is a powerful mechanism of the effects of chronic stress such as that associated with poverty on psychopathology (e.g., Evans & Kim, 2012). To contribute solutions to mental health disparities, we need interventions capable of affecting the systems that confer the risk. Since the psychobiologic stress response system (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis; HPA) is a central mechanism linking health disparities to chronic stress, the stress response is a critical system to target. Improving children's ability to cope with stress and regulate their reactivity ha the potential to break the cycle of damage, especially if the coping strategies and regulatory processes that we target have effects at the physiologic level. Preliminary evidence from the PIs research lab has emerged showing that different types of coping are evident at the level of the HPA-it is, therefore, time to evaluate whether a coping intervention designed for children facing chronic stress will both (a) improve children's ability to use primary and secondary control coping, and (b) have sustained effects at the physiologic level. We have developed just such an intervention, which builds on these exciting new findings and is designed to address core underlying mechanisms of risk and repair in the highly stressful context of poor, urban youths' lives.  Preadolescence is a crucial time during which children's ability to recognize stress and it causes matures, and repertoires for coping with stress grow in both size and complexity. In addition, preadolescence is a time of increased brain changes and growth in key self-regulatory organs and systems. Preadolescents are, therefore, at a ripe stage to benefit from coping-based prevention and the plasticity of this developmental period suggests that such changes have the potential to be long-lasting. Our new prevention program is designed to prevent the onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in preadolescent children facing chronic stress. Two mechanisms of action are targeted in this project. First, the project seeks to demonstrate that children facing chronic stress stemming from poverty, discrimination, and violence exposure can acquire and utilize new ways of coping that are adaptive in a wide variety of circumstances. Second, the project will examine the extent to which improved coping resulting from the intervention engages the physiologic intermediate mechanism of the HPA. Finally, the project aims to link changes in coping and the HPA to changes in internalizing symptoms that would signal prevention of the emergence of new or worsening of existing symptoms. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system that leads to psychopathology can offer new directions for combatting health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and socioeconomic disparities in physical and mental health problems are large, persistent, and severe; begin during childhood; and stem from in part damage to physiologic stress response systems caused by chronic stress. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system may offer new directions for combatting health disparities. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a new prevention program designed to teach preadolescent children effective ways for coping with chronic stress that will have direct effects on their physiologic stress response systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and ultimately prevent onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms and disorders.",Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress,9260067,R21MH107631,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Wolves ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' preadolescence ', ' preteen ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenic ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' R21/R33 Program ', ' R21/R33 Mechanism ', ' Phased Innovation Awards ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' stem ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' intervention effect ', ' coping mechanism ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' violence victimization ', ' racial minority ', ' psychological symptom ', ' stress symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R21,2017,581616,0.18156684209296528
"Racial Disparities in Health: The Roles of Stress, Social Relations and the Cardiovascular System Hypertension is the number one cause of racial group disparities in mortality in the U.S. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which race is linked with the cardiovascular system is key. African Americans (AA) are exposed to more stress across the lifespan and lifetime adversity is associated with cardiovascular disease (CHD) and hypertension. However, mechanisms accounting for the links between long-term stress exposure, hypertension and CHD remain unclear. Cardiovascular reactivity is hypothesized to be a major contender as it predicts increased risk of cardiac events and mortality, especially among people with hypertension. According to existing theories of racial health disparities, stress, and social relations, racial health disparities are due to variations in long-term exposure to stress and stress reactivity (biological, psychological, behavioral) and those race differences are moderated by social relations and age. In response to the FOA Aging Research on Stress and Resilience to Address Health Disparities in the United States (RFA-AG-16-022), the present study seeks to understand how long-term stress exposure links with stress reactivity among AA and EA adults. This study capitalizes the existing longitudinal Social Relations and Health Study (SRS),a regionally representative panel sample of AA and EA individuals from the Detroit metropolitan area who began participating in 1992 (ages 13 to 93) and completed the third wave in 2015 (ages 30 to 95). The proposed study will incorporates two new studies of short-term stress reactivity: 1) a daily stress study and 2) a laboratory stress study. The daily stress study will target 300 participants (50% AA; 50%EA) and will incorporate a 4 day experience sampling study of self-reported stress exposure and reactivity (psychological, behavioral) as well as two ambulatory monitoring devices to assess biological reactivity: 1) a newly developed non-invasive continuous monitoring ring device that provides estimates of vascular resistance and 2) a watch that assesses heart rate, heart rate variability, and galvanic skin response. In the laboratory study we will examine reactivity to standard laboratory stressors among a sample of 50 AA and 50 EA respondents who completed the daily stress study to examine more thoroughly their physiological responses to stress with the same ambulatory ring and watch as well as established continuous monitors. The proposed research addresses three aims: 1) Test links between long- term stress exposure and short-term stress reactivity among EA and AA adults, 2) Examine age differences in long-term stress exposure and short-term reactivity by race, and 3) Determine how long-term social relationships moderate individual differences in stress exposure and reactivity. This project has public health significance as it will identify individuals who are more reactive to stress and the immediate as well as lifespan factors that are associated with greater stress reactivity. A more nuanced understanding of the psychological and biological implications of stress among diverse populations will lead to the development and testing of interventions for reducing stress, later health problems, and health disparities. Project Narrative African Americans are more likely to develop hypertension and to die from hypertension than European Americans. This project seeks to understand how long term pattern of stress, social ties, and hypertension contribute to variations in stress exposure and stress reactivity in daily life. The project is particularly significant for public health as identifying individuals who are more reactive to stress may allow for the development of interventions targeting specific populations of individuals who are more at risk of further health problems and mortality.","Racial Disparities in Health: The Roles of Stress, Social Relations and the Cardiovascular System",9353718,R01AG054371,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Outpatient Monitoring ', ' Ambulatory Monitoring ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' stressor ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Devices ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' heart rate variability ', ' stress reactivity ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2017,745530,0.19699063878168138
"Prenatal Pollution, Stress and Maternal-child Health: Role of Immunomodulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The goal of this Career Development Plan is to launch an independent research career in children's environmental health, specializing in climate change research, with a focus on the health vulnerabilities of children.

An interdisciplinary mentorship team has been selected to provide guidance and expertise in environmental epidemiology, psychosocial stress, immunology, and psychiatry. The proposed training and research program will position the candidate to work effectively with a number of active, multidisciplinary groups at the completion of the award period. The project is guided by the following career objectives: 1) to gain knowledge on diverse methods of spatial modeling for social and physical environmental exposure assessment; 2) to gain experience working with observed and modeled climate data, in particular, downscaled climate model outputs; 3) to develop expertise in advanced statistical methods relevant to climate and health work specifically focusing on air pollution, stress, and inflammatory biomarkers; 4) to acquire familiarity with additional climate-sensitive outcomes such as birth and mental health outcomes and mechanistic intermediaries. This career development plan will facilitate the candidate becoming a leading expert and independent investigator in children's environmental health and advance the NIH's mission to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Public Health Relevance: Climate change is estimated to result in over 200,000 premature deaths per year - over 80% of which are among children - and projected to cause additional health effects in the coming decades. Air pollution and psychosocial stress exposures, and the underlying immune mechanisms of maternal and child health are important climate-sensitive factors in this public health issue. This project aims to build the epidemiologic skills of a pediatrician dedicated to finding ways to reduce climate health impacts both within the USA and globally.","Prenatal Pollution, Stress and

"Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing racial disparity in obesity has reached a critical juncture, particularly among black and white females. Obesity is now being perpetuated across generations. While there is uncertainty about how best to prevent obesity and the related racial disparities, converging lines of evidence support the influence of stress on obesity. We hypothesize that income and race are associated with higher levels of both objective and perceived stress, which in turn are associated with higher rates of dysregulated eating, a behavior posited to result in an increased rate of obesity. Finally, we propose that stress has a direct effect on the level of obesity in the offspring. We propose to model these relationships longitudinally using the National Growth and Healthy Study (NGHS) that enrolled equal numbers of black and white girls and that contains extensive measures of life stress, nonhomeostatic eating, household demographic and socioeconomic indicators and cardiometabolic risk factors for black and white girls initially sampled at age 10 and interviewed annually until age 20. We will extend these data, adding a new wave of data collection for the women who are now 36 and their children. We will interview participants regarding their current levels of stress, household food insecurity, dysregulated eating behaviors such as dietary restraint and overeating, and collect data on dietary intake and physical activity. We will collect measured weight and central adiposity and clinical measures of metabolic syndrome on both the women and their children. Building on the rich source of longitudinal data that NGHS provides, we will model relationships between these factors and weight status from early childhood to adulthood among these women and their children in order to examine the effects of cumulative stress, eating behaviors and obesity on obesity in the next generation. The study aims to test the hypotheses that: 1) stress and dysregulated eating results in an increased rate of obesity, exacerbated by food insecurity; 2) maternal stress and dysregulated eating have a direct effect on the level of obesity and markers of metabolic syndrome in offspring; and, 3) race and income are associated with higher levels of stress and dysregulated eating in women. Our preliminary data suggests that stress leads to excessive weight gain ten years later in the NGHS cohort. We will identify predictors of weight gain trajectories from childhood to adulthood. These constructs have the potential to lead to promising interventions coupled with traditional diet and physical activity components that will help girls and women throughout the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing black/white disparities and the perpetuation of obesity across generations has reached a critical juncture, particularly among girls and women. The current proposal seeks to add a new wave of data collection to survey participants regarding current stress factors, household food insecurity, and non-homeostatic eating such as restrained and drive to overeat and evaluate the relationships between these factors and weight gain trajectories in a longitudinal cohort of girls followed from age 10 to 36 years. We believe that this approach will identify modifiable stress-based factors that can be incorporated into intervention trials leading to sustained changes in children's and women's weight trajectories.","Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity",9320775,R01HD073568,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Data Collection ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Mothers ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Weights and Measures ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' Body Measures ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Body fat ', ' Life ', ' Calories ', ' Source ', ' waist circumference ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' Coupled ', ' 16 year old ', ' sixteen years of age ', ' sixteen year old ', ' age 16 years ', ' 16 years of age ', ' public health relevance ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' cardio-metabolic risk ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' black/white disparity ', ' maternal obesity ', ' maternal weight ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,485411,0.055760971475478135
"Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women Project Summary Significance: Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian/gay and bisexual (LGB) women report higher rates of physical health problems. Current evidence, which is largely based on self-report, suggests that important health disparities exist in conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). To date, however, no study has tested differences in objective measures of health risks between LGB and heterosexual women in a representative sample of young adults. We aim to fill this gap by examining putative health disparities using rigorous objective biomarkers of health (i.e. cardiometabolic functioning and inflammation) in young adulthood in a representative, racially diverse sample of young women who are participating in an ongoing longitudinal study, the Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS) (Aim 1). We will link prospectively gathered data on discrimination stress and childhood adversity to determine the role of stress exposure in the association between sexual minority status and early adult health (Aim 2). Finally, we will test whether health promotion during adolescence attenuates the association between discrimination stress and health risks among LGB women (Aim 3). Approach: Our plan is to leverage comprehensive, prospectively collected data from the PGS and measure current health indicators among LGB women in the PGS (n=230) and a demographic frequency matched sample of heterosexual women (n=230) in early adulthood (ages 22-25 years). Assessments of health will include: waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, cholesterol, fatty acids, glucose, insulin, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6; TNF-α), and C-reactive protein. We propose to assess discrimination stress via cortisol and heart rate reactivity to a lab- based discrimination stressor and perceived discrimination experiences measured annually and prospectively from ages 15 to 21 years. Childhood adversity (family stress, trauma, abuse, and peer victimization) has been assessed annually for in the PGS from youth and caregiver reports. Physical and emotional health promotion during adolescence has been assessed in a number of ways in the PGS including vaccine uptake, safe sexual practices, and physical activity, supportive adult presence, and will be complemented by interviews on school climate and coming out experiences. Investigators: Dr. Kathryn Keenan is the Principal Investigator, Drs. Alison Hipwell, Stephanie Stepp, Karen Matthews, Alicia Matthews and Alida Bouris are Co-Investigators, and Ms. Kristen Wroblewski is the biostatistician. Dr. Constance Hammen is the consultant. The investigators have led many successful NIH-funded studies and represent expertise in developmental psychopathology, women's mental health, sexual minority physical and mental health, health psychology, and biostatistics. Collectively, the investigators have experience in administering the TSST to vulnerable populations, measuring cortisol reactivity, and testing hypotheses involving cardiometabolic and inflammatory functioning. Environment: This proposal builds on long-standing, productive collaborations among investigators at the Universities of Chicago, Illinois, and Pittsburgh. Innovation/Impact: The proposed study provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore health disparities in LGB women in a rigorous manner, examine potential mechanisms by which sexual orientation confers health risks, and identify protective factors in a representative and racially diverse sample of LGB and heterosexual women. Project Narrative The goals of the proposed study are to test whether LGB women differ significantly from heterosexual women on objective biomarkers of health and identify mechanisms by which sexual minority women are at heightened risk for compromised health. It is hypothesized that discrimination stress and childhood stressors have adverse effects on metabolic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular systems that maintain health. The proposal also aims to identify health promotion behaviors that mitigate these associations to inform tailored preventive and intervention approaches for at-risk women.",Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women,9291370,R01HL137246,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Chicago ', ' Cholesterol ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Illinois ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lipids ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Morbidity -

"Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender people are a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. They express their gender-variant identity in various ways and through a multitude of self- labels, both within and outside of binary conceptualizations of sex/gender as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine. While public awareness of this diversity has grown, our understanding of transgender people's experience is limited by a lack of systematic research on their identity development. Health inequities documented among the U.S. transgender population include depression (44%), suicidal ideation (54%) and attempts (31%), anxiety (33%), smoking (36%), and HIV infection (12% based on self- report; 28% on testing). Social stigma attached to gender nonconformity has been proposed as a major contributing factor to these health inequities. Previous research found that the vast majority of transgender individuals experienced discrimination. Much of the data, however, is limited by the use of small convenience samples of transgender women with a history of sex work, recruited from AIDS and social service agencies. The goal of this study is to move beyond these limitations by using purposive, venue-based sampling to recruit a broad, diverse sample of transgender people in 3 U.S. cities--New York, San Francisco, and Atlanta-and enroll them into a mixed-method longitudinal study to test an adaptation of the minority stress model, investigating vulnerability, risk and resilience in the context of identity development. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the process of transgender identity development based on qualitative lifeline interviews with a sample of 90 transgender individuals ages 16 and older, and identify periods of acute vulnerability and characteristics of resilience; (2) Informed by findings from Aim 1, to refine a model combining identity development, minority stress, and resilience, and to develop/adapt measures to assess the model's key constructs; (3) To test the model of resilience in a cohort of transgender individuals (N = 480) stratified by city, gender, and age, and follow them over time (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow up interviews); and (4) To triangulate qualitative and quantitative data on identity development and minority stress processes in order to inform the future development and testing of intervention strategies aimed at fostering resilience and reducing stigma and discrimination. By achieving these aims, this study will make a significant advance in scientific knowledge about gender identity development, minority stress processes (enacted stigma, felts stigma, concealment, shame and their impact on health and psychosocial adjustment), minority coping (on an individual as well as community level), and the development of resilience over time. The study is innovative in its focus on an understudied minority population, the application of the lifeline interview method to this population, and the adaptation and testing of the minority stress model within the context of transgender identity development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research to date has found inequities in mental health, substance use, HIV infection, and other health concerns among gender nonconforming people in the United States. This study takes a longitudinal, mixed- method approach to uncover the mechanism of how stigma and minority stress affect health and psychosocial development among this population, identifying periods of acute vulnerability and corresponding resilience. Findings will inform the development of future intervention strategies aimed at reducing stigma and promoting the health and wellbeing of this and other vulnerable populations.","Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse Populations",9296166,R01HD079603,"['Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Homosexuals ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Shame ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Acute ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Series ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Feminine ', ' Masculine ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' psychosocial development ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' man ', "" man's "", ' public health relevance ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' transgender women ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender men ', ' transmen ', ' transman ', ' trans-men ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' Hormone use ', ' gender variant ', ' gender variance ', ' peer support ', ' family support ', ' gender diversity ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2017,593904,0.06362007634242797
"Setting a trajectory: biological markers of early stress and child development DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): To identify at-risk children precise indicators of the biological changes associated with early life adversity, including prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) and racial disparities are needed. Without reliable indicators capable of providing mechanistic insight the ability to design and implement innovative interventions, and alter negative developmental trajectories, remains limited. Alterations in the stress response system, determined by salivary cortisol levels, are associated with PNMS. Disrupted parent-child attachment, as well as the therapeutic repair of this relationship, has also been found to influence the cortisol response in infants. However, the stress hypo-responsive period in early childhood may limit the utility of cortisol as a stand-alone indicator during this critical developmental time point. Additionally, while cortisol indicates dysregulation in the HPA axis it provides minimal mechanistic information. The established role of genetic and epigenetic factors, including FKBP5 and miRNAs, to both the responsiveness and adaptation of the HPA axis suggest they play an important role in the underlying mechanism. Concurrent measurement of gene expression, miRNA, and cortisol is expected to more robustly define how early adversity is biological embedded. Saliva represents an ideal accessible biological source that reflects an individual's complex internal milieu. Recent evidence indicates that mRNA, miRNA and telomere length can be reliably measured in saliva. Studies have also demonstrated changes in each of these markers with exposure to early adversity and stress. These collective findings indicate that an epigenetic psychophysiological profile concurrently measuring each component is feasible and a critical next step in research seeking to chart the trajectory of mental illness and define the earliest intervention time points. This study expects to enroll infants of African American women with extensive characterization of PNMS and maternal preconception adversity. Saliva will be collected pre and post a known stressor designed to activate the HPA axis at two early developmental time points. Infants will be stressed before (4 months, using the Still Face Procedure) and after (12 months, using the Strange Situation Procedure (SSP)) the development of attachment. The cortisol response to the stressor, fold change in FKBP5 mRNA pre/post the stressor as well as initial levels of miR-134 and miR-16 and telomere length will be determined. Leveraging the increased statistical power associated with propensity score matching this proposal will test the association between PNMS, attachment and salivary markers while controlling for preconception adversity. Achievement of the proposal aims of this proposal is expected to provide enhanced biological evidence in support of the implementation of attachment based interventions early in the life course. The critical need to more effectively address persistent health disparities and decrease the negative health outcomes associated with toxic stress requires the development of innovative methodologies that both define biological mechanisms and track the effectiveness of interventions at the behavioral, physiologic, and molecular level. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because an enhanced mechanistic understanding of the biological embedding of early adversity is ultimately expected to lead to novel interventions and preventive efforts that alter the life-long negative health trajectories associated with toxic stress and health disparities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to the part of the NIMH's mission that pertains to strengthening the public health impact of NIMH funded research and to charting mental illness trajectories to determine when to intervene.",Setting a trajectory: biological markers of early stress and child development,9253090,R01MH101533,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Health ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Infant ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Methodology ', ' Mission ', ' Motion ', ' mRNA Precursor ', ' premRNA ', ' RNA, Messenger, Precursors ', ' Pre-mRNA ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Parents ', ' Play ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saliva ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' FKBP Rotamase ', ' FKBP ', ' FK506 Binding Proteins ', ' FK-506-Binding Protein ', ' Tacrolimus Binding Proteins ', ' telomere ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Early Intervention ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Salivary ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' Transcend ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' hypothalamic pituitary axis ', ' novel ', ' Toddler ', ' disease classification ', ' nosology ', ' disorder classification ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Preventive ', ' Age-Months ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' mRNA Expression ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Security ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIEHS ', ' National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Secure ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' ']",NIMH,TULANE UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,R01,2017,462864,0.10772012518117609
"Identity Stress and Health in Three Cohorts of LGB individuals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth and adults suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Minority stress theory suggests that because of prejudice and stigma in the social environment, LGB people experience excess stress that leads to poor health outcomes and health disparities. Because of its focus on the social environment, minority stress theory leads us to predict that the character of stress processes affecting LGBs shift along with improvement in the social environment. Similarly shifting are notions of LGB identity, connection with the community, and the types of social and health services LGB people seek. If we are to achieve the U.S. Public Health Services' goal of reducing health disparities related to sexual orientation, we need to understand the impact of changes in identity and minority stress on LGB health and, using this knowledge, inform public health interventions across the lifespan. To gain this knowledge, we propose a longitudinal study using a probability sample of diverse LGBs representative of LGBs in the U.S. population. We seek to compare 3 cohorts of LGB individuals-aged 18 - 25, 34 - 42, and 48 - 55 years old-who are distinct in that they were exposed to significantly different social environments when they came of age. We are interested in ways that identity and minority stress predict health across the cohorts. We will use a mixed method design that allows us to gain knowledge from both qualitative and survey data. We use an innovative 2-stage procedure to recruit a sample of 676 LGB individuals representative of U.S. Black, Latino, and White LGB populations. We assess respondents baseline and annually for 3 years thereafter. In a qualitative study, we use a narrative life history to assess a diverse group of Black, Latino, White, and Asian LGB individuals in urban and rural regions of New York, California, and Arizona. We hypothesize that: 1. Despite readily acknowledging an LGB identity and coming out at a younger age than did older cohorts, the younger cohorts differ from older cohorts in that their LGB identity is less central, they are less strongly identified with the LGB community, and have different meanings of sexual orientation and identity. 2. Compared with older, the younger cohort experience less minority stress related to their own acceptance of a gay identity and coming out, but more external stress, including prejudice-related stressful life events, antigay violence, and everyday forms of discrimination. 3. Members of younger LGB cohorts utilize fewer LGB-identified social and health services than do members of older LGB cohorts. 4. In structural equations, the minority stress model functions equally well in predicting health outcomes in the younger and older cohorts, but patterns of stress, resilience, and health outcomes differ among the cohorts in accordance with findings in Aims 1 and 2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth continue to suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Social changes have significantly altered the developmental trajectories of today's LGB youth, requiring that we reexamine our knowledge of stress and health in this population.

"Longitudinal Perspectives on Race and Health in MIDUS: Insights from Milwaukee DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The MIDUS (Midlife in the U.S.) national longitudinal study included, at its second wave, a sample of African American adults from Milwaukee, WI, a high segregated U.S. city, to increase participation of minority respondents in clinic-based biological assessments. Numerous advances have been generated on the impact of psychosocial stress, including perceived discrimination, on health, well-being, and physiological risk factors. This revised application requests funds to conduct a longitudinal follow-up 9-10 years later on the Milwaukee sample to parallel longitudinal work currently underway on the main MIDUS sample. We hypothesize that Milwaukee African Americans compared to their White counterparts in MIDUS will show earlier age-related decline in health (chronic conditions, health symptoms, biological risk factors), health behaviors (physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol use) and cognitive capacities. Further we predict that race differences in longitudinal aging will be accounted for by differential environmental exposures (work/family stress, perceived discrimination) as well as more adverse experiences related to the economic recession. Exploiting the rich psychosocial assessments in MIDUS, we will investigate factors that moderate the impact of stress exposures on health. Such analyses will include vulnerability factors such as psychological distress (depression, anxiety, anger) hypothesized to exacerbate the adverse impact of environmental stress on health as well as resilience factors such as psychosocial strengths (purpose in life, sense of control, optimism, social ties) hypothesized to mitigate against such pernicious effects. The revised proposed distills the innovative features of the proposed research and offers novel analytic strategies to test key hypotheses. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing evidence suggests that age-related changes in health differ notably by such factors as income, educational status and race. This research will examine stress exposures in African Americans in the most segregated city in the U.S.: Milwaukee, WI, and compare them to Whites of similar economic and educational backgrounds. A key focus is on identifying factors that mitigate against poor health profiles in such contexts o adversity, so as to advance knowledge of protective resources that need to be more widely nurtured and promoted.",Longitudinal Perspectives on Race and Health in MIDUS: Insights from Milwaukee,9308805,R01AG047154,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Anxiety ', ' Archives ', ' Budgets ', ' Buffers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Cities ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Health Insurance ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retirement ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Economic Recession ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physical activity ', ' Malaise ', ' insight ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' Inequality ', ' Funding ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Respondent ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Clinic ', ' psychosocial ', ' Episodic memory ', ' educationally disadvantaged ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' economic impact ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Deterioration ', ' Sampling ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' executive function ', ' executive control ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Request for Applications ', ' NIH RFA ', ' Cognitive ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Self-Administered ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' early onset ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' computerized ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' public health relevance ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' Minority Participation ', ' cognitive capacity ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,R01,2017,299680,0.11172984746094627
"RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULTS' PATHWAYS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong African American Families Healthy Adult Project (SHAPE) followed 493 African American youth from ages 11 to 20. Participants have grown up in rural Georgia communities in which poverty rates for African Americans are among the highest in the nation. Life in rural areas can be more challenging than in urban areas due to restricted educational and employment opportunities, difficulties in obtaining physical and mental health care, and a lack of public transportation. Despite living in such challenging situations, many SHAPE participants have displayed high levels of psychosocial functioning across adolescence. We identified naturally occurring factors in family and community networks that protected these youth from the consequences of SES- and race-related stressors that proliferate in rural Southern contexts. Epidemiological research reveals that African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of chronic diseases of aging (CDA) such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence indicates that contemporaneous health determinants in midlife or later cannot adequately account for why rural African Americans experience high rates of CDAs. Rather, many CDAs incubate in physiological systems for decades prior to the manifestation of disease. In the next 5 years, SHAPE participants will experience a stressful developmental transition. Job turnover rates are high, and the combined effects of poor preparation for employment and discriminatory hiring practices make obtaining stable employment a protracted and often demoralizing process. These stressors have the potential to take a toll on SHAPE participants' health, undermining psychosocial functioning and contributing to CDA-related vulnerabilities. To understand the pathways from stress exposure during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood to CDA vulnerabilities and psychosocial outcomes, we propose to extend the SHAPE research program in two key ways. First we propose to augment our health assessment of SHAPE participants to include markers of metabolic syndrome and pro-inflammatory tendencies which are linked to the development of CDAs. Second, we propose to investigate a critical question for public health scientists and practitioners. In response to stress exposure, some SHAPE participants will evince escalation in CDA vulnerability whereas other will not. This proposal is designed to investigate why. Evidence from laboratory-based studies suggests a central role for psychosocial risk and protective mechanisms in young adulthood and earlier phases of development in altering the pathways linking stress exposure and CDA precursors. Prospective research investigating these risk and protective mechanisms, however, is virtually nonexistent. We thus propose to collect data from SHAPE participants, at ages 22 and 24 years, that includes CDA precursors along with assessments of environmental stressors, psychosocial adjustment, risk and protective mechanisms, HPA axis/SNS deregulation, and health behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of health disparities. Recent research suggests that the roots of these disparities lie in earlier stages of development as young people cope with stressful environments. In this study we investigate the risk and protective processes that explain why some young adult rural African Americans develop vulnerabilities to chronic diseases and others do not.",RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULTS' PATHWAYS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH,9308702,R01HD030588,"['adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Stress ', ' Sympathetic Nervous System ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Weather ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Incubated ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Proliferating ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' discount ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' racial identity ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' rural African American ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2017,606095,0.058360032826123245
"Orexins contribute to sex differences in habituation to stress and cognitive function ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, are serious mental illnesses that occur twice as frequently in women compared to men. Despite this disparity, we do not understand the biological basis of these sex differences. Human studies have revealed differences in the levels of the neuropeptides orexins in anxious and depressed patients compared to controls. Additionally, animal studies have revealed that orexins contribute to the stress response and to anxiety-like behavior. We have obtained preliminary data indicating orexins are differentially expressed in the brains of male and female rats. Consistent with previous research, we found that female rats exhibit a higher hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis response to repeated stress compared with males. Furthermore, females exhibited a stress-related impairment in cognitive flexibility but males did not. Therefore, we hypothesize that this sex difference in orexin expression contributes to the exacerbated stress response and poorer stress-related cognitive flexibility in female rats. The proposed research aims to elucidate how orexins contribute to sex differences in the stress response at both a single cell and behavioral level. Specifically, Aim 1 of this proposal will use in vitro electrophysiology to determine if sex differences are observed i the membrane and firing properties of orexin neurons before and after stress. Morphology of orexin neurons in males and females will also be examined using Neurolucida neuron tracing software. Aim 2 will directly test the hypothesis that increased orexin expression mediates the higher stress response and poorer stress-related cognitive flexibility. We will use DREADDS (Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs) technology to manipulate orexin action during stress. We expect that inhibition of orexin neurons in females will decrease the stress response and improve subsequent cognitive function. These experiments provide the first evidence linking orexins to sex differences in stress and cognition, but these results will also have immediate implications for treatment. Orexin antagonists are currently used to treat insomnia, so it is crucial we understand how these neuropeptides differ between males and females, as there may be a future need to develop sex-specific guidelines in dosing. Moreover, orexins may regulate stress responses, food intake, autonomic responses, and emotional memory and thereby contribute to a variety of psychiatric symptoms. In this way, targeting orexins may treat a broad range of psychiatric symptoms in a sex specific manner. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Women are twice as likely to suffer from stress-related psychiatric disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression, however, the neurobiological basis underlying this sex difference is unknown. The proposed research could provide the first strong evidence demonstrating that the neuropeptide orexin contributes to sex differences in stress and cognition. This project will have immediate implications for treatment, as orexin antagonists are currently used to treat insomnia; given the broad effects of orexins, targeting orexins may treat a broad range of psychiatric symptoms in a sex specific manner.",Orexins contribute to sex differences in habituation to stress and cognitive function,9398038,F32MH109269,"['suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adrenal Glands ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Attention ', ' Behavior ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' spinal fluid ', ' cerebral spinal fluid ', ' Cerebrospinal Fluid ', ' Cognition ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Metabolism and Endocrinology ', ' Endocrinology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' In Vitro ', ' male ', ' Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neuropeptides ', ' Patients ', ' Pituitary Gland ', ' Pituitary Nervous System ', ' Pituitary ', ' Hypophysis Cerebri ', ' Hypophysis ', ' Rattus ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Rat ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Computer software ', ' Software ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' General Viruses ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' biotinyl L lysine ', ' biocytin ', ' Mediating ', ' promotor ', ' promoter ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Whole-Cell Recordings ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Morphology ', ' restraint ', ' cognitive function ', ' Viral ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' stress related disorder ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' acute stress ', ' Emotional ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' Dendritic Spines ', ' dendrite spine ', ' Sleeplessness ', ' Insomnia Disorder ', ' Insomnia ', ' behavioral habituation ', ' hypocretin ', ' orexin ', ' hypocretins/orexins ', ' hypocretin/orexin ', ' Hcrts/ORXs ', ' Hcrt/ORX ', ' Hcrt protein ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Dose ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' severe mental illness ', ' Attentional deficit ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' flexibility ', ' flexible ', ' cognitive performance ', ' anxiety-like behavior ', ' anxiety-related behavior ', ' anxious ', ' habituation ', ' differential expression ', ' transcriptional differences ', ' differentially expressed ', ' depressed patient ', ' designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs ', ' DREADDs ', ' psychiatric symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,CHILDREN'S HOSP OF PHILADELPHIA,F32,2017,14267,0.10700126256374863
"Early Life Mechanisms of Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma-Related Risk in Offspring: Epigenetic and Neurodevelopmental Pathways PROJECT SUMMARY: Evidence suggests that the effects of trauma exposure can be transmitted across generations to shape pathways to psychological impairment in offspring, with the perinatal period identified as pivotal to these processes. Although the mechanisms and timing of these effects are not well elucidated, an emerging literature focuses on the influence of maternal posttraumatic stress (PTS) during pregnancy. PTS affects up to 40% of pregnant women, particularly those from low-income, minority populations with documented health disparities. Maternal PTS may interrupt healthy development of biological stress systems in offspring, namely the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, a well-defined biological pathway that is modulated by environmental and genetic factors. Recent studies have begun to link maternal PTS with biobehavioral indicators of stress reactivity in offspring, and these so-called intermediate phenotypes may serve as early markers of stress-related psychopathology, which can emerge in infancy and have cascading and disabling effects across the lifespan. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are hypothesized to play a critical role in influencing these processes. This hypothesis builds on studies, mainly in adults, linking PTS with DNA methylation of genes implicated in HPA axis functionality and candidate gene studies showing effects of maternal trauma exposure on DNA methylation in adult offspring. Notably, pilot data from our lab link maternal PTS during pregnancy with newborn infant DNA methylation of a single gene (FKBP5) implicated in the stress response. No study has yet applied an epigenomic approach, which offers a more holistic and unbiased method of discovery, for examining intergenerational transmission of trauma. We propose an exploratory study to prospectively explore predictive relationships between maternal pregnancy PTS, genome- wide methylation patterns in offspring at birth, multi-level biobehavioral indicators of infant stress reactivity at 6 months (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia, heart rate, cortisol, observed distress), during a laboratory stress challenge, and key elements of the caregiving environment (i.e. observed maternal sensitivity, family support, family stressors), which may moderate these intergenerational effects.

"Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now large-scale epidemiological evidence that aspects of chronic psychological stress, such as early adversity or job strain, and early life stress, predict earlier disease onset and mortality. Despite documentation of the importance of stress to health, there are several critical barriers that prevent progress in the epidemiological study of stress as a risk factor for disease. Measurement of stress is inherently complex and multi-level (e.g., social, psychological, physiological). There are few agreed upon 'gold standard' measures of stress, hence measurement is often inconsistent and superficial where heterogeneous constructs are conflated. There is also little understanding of the conditions under which stress exposure can promote vulnerability vs. resiliency to disease. Meanwhile, there have been rapid advances in the basic science of stress processes, which have helped to unpack the cognitive and affective components, links to brain and peripheral physiological responses, and richer measures of daily stress - e.g., through ecological momentary assessments using technology to obtain detailed profiles of exposures and contexts. Thus, epidemiological stress science can benefit from a more coherent multilevel model that encompasses better measurement of lifespan exposures and responses, including the social, psychological, and physiological indices of stress that have the greatest impact on health. The proposed R24 will recruit excellent scientists with relevant methods to apply their interests to th advancement of stress measurement across human development, with a focus on how lifespan stress affects health in mid to late life. Aims include: 1) Development of a stress measurement taxonomy, including guidelines for best measurement; 2) Development of a 'toolbox' of short measures of stress that can be used in epidemiological studies of adult aging internationally. These will be drawn from innovative measurement from basic experimental and field research, refinement/shortening of existing measures, and results from comparative validation of promising measures; and 3) Promotion of stress research in epidemiological studies of aging, both through harmonizing existing measures and adding new toolbox measures. This in turn will lead to discoveries that refine the taxonomy and research methodologies. Improved stress measurement offers tremendous opportunities for advancing the field of basic research, enhancing the efficacy of health-promotion interventions and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic stress can impair health, but the mechanisms are not well known and the measures that investigators use are diverse and inconsistent. This network will promote better theory and new measures, and develop a ""stress measurement toolbox,"" that large-scale studies can use. This in turn will lead to a deeper understanding of how stress affects psychological well-being as well as disease etiology and progression, and ways to intervene.",Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging,9265723,R24AG048024,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Aging ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Human Development ', ' indexing ', ' Internships ', ' intern ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Paper ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Taxonomy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' validation studies ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Impaired health ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Affective ', ' comparative ', ' critical period ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' standard measure ', ' population health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' study population ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R24,2017,274767,0.1939187416217695
"Stress-Related Psychobiology and Inflammation in Diabetic African-American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority populations are exposed to high levels of trauma and have minimal access to psychiatric and general medical care. The studies proposed in the current application seek to investigate the psychobiological mechanisms responsible for elevated cardiometabolic illness risk in African-American women of lower socioeconomic status (SES) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and trauma-related psychopathology (post- traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and/or major depressive disorder [MDD]). PTSD in particular, and certain forms of mood and anxiety disorders in general, have been repeatedly associated with dysregulation of the nervous, neuroendocrine, and immune systems that is generally characterized by increased circulating norepinephrine and reduced parasympathetic tone, abnormal secretion of cortisol, and variably elevated systemic inflammation. Quantitative differences in the production of autonomic, neuroendocrine, and inflammatory innate immune mediators of the stress response, distinct from those observed in psychologically healthy subjects, are found in patients with PTSD, MDD, or PTSD/MDD. As a consequence, stress mediators may differentially influence the development and progression of obesity, dyslipidemia, carbohydrate intolerance, and impaired endothelial function in patients affected by PTSD and/or MDD through diagnosis- dependent biological pathways. Although a number of reports suggest a relationship between autonomic, neuroendocrine, and immune factors when attempting to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms linking cardiometabolic illnesses and trauma-related psychiatric disorders, to date no studies have examined in a comprehensive manner the ways by which these systems interact. Accordingly, this project seeks to leverage our extensive experience with a low SES, African-American, primary care population with the well-developed research and recruiting infrastructure of the parent project (MH071537) to test the following three hypotheses in a sample of (N=140) female, African-American primary care patients with T2DM: 1.) Significant differences in measures of autonomic and neuroendocrine function assessed before, during, and after psychosocial stress challenge (Trier Social Stress Test) will be identified between trauma- exposed controls and subjects diagnosed with PTSD, MDD, or PTSD+MDD; 2.) Measurements of autonomic function and neuroendocrine mediators collected before, during, and after psychosocial stress challenge will predict measurements of inflammatory mediators collected before, during, and after the psychosocial stress challenge; 3.) Innate inflammatory mediators collected before, during, and after psychosocial stress challenge will predict differences in standard measures of cardiometabolic function (e.g. glucose tolerance test, flow mediated vasodilatation). Knowledge gained by the experiments proposed in this application will increase our understanding of the psychobiology of stress in women with T2DM and trauma-related psychopathology. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Minority populations and individuals of low socioeconomic status are exposed to high levels of trauma and have only minimal access to general medical and psychiatric care. In these populations, stress- related medical and psychiatric disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, post-traumatic stress disorder, and depression are common. Individuals with co-occurring diabetes and post-traumatic stress disorder experience a more severe course of illness than individuals with diabetes alone and the studies proposed in this application will enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms linking stress-related psychiatric illness to medical illness.",Stress-Related Psychobiology and Inflammation in Diabetic African-American Women,9234590,R01MH099211,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety Disorders ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' psychological disorder ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' mental illness ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Immune Regulators ', ' Immune Mediators/Modulators ', ' Immune Mediators ', ' Biomodulators ', ' Biological Response Modifiers ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Control Groups ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Female ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' IPGTT ', ' Glucose tolerance test ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Immune system ', ' allergic/immunologic organ system ', ' allergic/immunologic body system ', ' Immunologic Factors ', ' immunological substance ', ' immunologic substance ', ' Immunological Factors ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Metabolic Diseases ', ' metabolism disorder ', ' Thesaurismosis ', ' Metabolic Disorder ', ' monocyte ', ' Marrow monocyte ', ' Blood monocyte ', ' Morbidity -

"Role of prenatal environment in psychopathology risk in preschool aged children of Mexican descent Project Summary The PI is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychology at California State University San Marcos. Her long-term goal is to sustain an independent research career examining mechanisms between socio-cultural factors, maternal affect and child outcomes related to mood dysregulation in the perinatal period. The aim of the proposed research is to examine the associations between prenatal exposure to maternal stressors related to cultural adaptation and maternal mental health and subsequent risk of presence of mood dysregulation in preschool aged children as measured by physiological stress vulnerability, emotional reactivity and depressive symptoms in the vulnerable US Mexican population. Prenatal factors have already been collected with a previous AREA grant R15 MH099-498-01A1 (maternal stress, depression and fetal and infant hypothalamic pituitary adrenal [HPA] axis activity). This proposal will follow the same participants and include 2 postnatal assessments of preschool children aged 3-5 years old. Three hypotheses will be tested: 1) greater prenatal exposure to maternal cultural stress and depression will be associated with greater increased negative emotionality and depressive-like symptoms in young children; 2) increased prenatal exposure to maternal cultural stress and depression will be related to increased child hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis as measured by hair cortisol, a non-invasive chronic stress measure, and blunted acute salivary cortisol; 3) cortisol levels that increase over childhood from infancy to preschool aged will be associated with greater negative emotionality and depressive symptoms. With information gained and prenatal information previously collected, we will also determine if fetal cortisol levels moderate or mediate the relationship between maternal variables and child risk/presence of mood dysregulation. The proposed research will follow 126 women of Mexican descent and their children previously recruited during pregnancy. This research has direct consequences for public health as the Mexican-American population is the most rapidly growing group in the US and Mexican-American children are exposed to high levels of stressors beginning in utero, which places them at increased risk for mood dysregulation. Socio-cultural variables may play a role in this increased risk, specifically stress related to cultural adaptation (acculturative stress, discrimination). However, if and the mechanism by which this occurs is unknown. Students will be directly involved at all levels of the project including recruitment and retention of participants, saliva and hair collection, child temperament and symptom assessment, sample management and performance of cortisol assays. The project will provide critical translational research experience for students, with an emphasis on encouraging racial/ethnic minority students, in line with the missions of AREA. This study directly addresses the role of environment and health disparities, two crossing cutting them in the NIMH strategic plan, in risk for mental health disorders in a vulnerable underserved population and provides a foundation that can lead to prenatal and preschool interventions directed toward socio-cultural factors in the high-risk Mexican-American population. Project Narrative The Mexican-American population is the most rapidly growing group in the US and young children are at risk for developing emotional and behavioral problems which may be driven by prenatal exposure to elevated levels of stress and depression that Mexican-American women experience during pregnancy. The proposed research will examine the association between prenatal exposure to stress related to cultural factors and depressive symptoms during pregnancy on risk and presence of mood dysregulation via measures of physiological stress vulnerability, emotional reactivity and depressive symptoms in preschool children aged 3-5 years old, an underinvestigated potentially useful intervention time point. The information obtained from the proposed research will aid in the design and development of future programs aimed at early identification of those at risk for mental health disorders among the

"Ethnic Influences on Stress, Energy Balance and Obesity in Adolescents Obesity is one of the most serious public health problems in the US; its prevalence has tripled in the last three decades and is associated with a range of short- and long-term medical and psychosocial problems. Adolescence is a critical period for the development and persistence of obesity, and is associated with changes in diet, physical activity and fitness, fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. There are racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity. African-American (AA) females have the highest rates of obesity, and the clustered risk factors for coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome are twice that of AA males. The reasons for racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity are not well understood. AA experience higher stress levels than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) due to economic and social inequalities, and the effect of stress on energy-dense diet and adiposity is more prominent in females. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link stress to obesity, particularly during adolescence when high rates of obesity, increased stressful experiences and stronger behavioral and physiological responses to stress emerge, will contribute to new clinical guidelines for reducing obesity and associated medical conditions in AA females.  The Physiological stress system affects obesity and mediates its adaptive functions via hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Prolonged stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion promotes the consumption of energy-dense diet (EI) and abdominal fat deposition both directly and indirectly through its effects on metabolic hormones. Stress also reduces physical activity and alters energy balance. The proposed study will examine the effects of stress and HPA axis on EI and physical activity-related energy expenditure in 100 AA and 100 NHW adolescent females. The effects on EI will be assessed in two contexts, the natural environment and under controlled conditions incorporating a standardized psychosocial stressor. Stress will be assessed in the natural environment as multiple domains (i.e., individual, family and social), and several indices of the HPA axis will be obtained to represent diurnal variation, its status over 12-15 weeks and reactivity to stress. Obesity- related parameters will be measured through anthropometry, fat distribution and cardio-metabolic biomarkers.  Associations among stress, HPA activity/function, energy balance and obesity-related parameters will be compared between and within AA and NHW samples. In combination they will improve our understanding of the social factors and biobehavioral mechanisms of both racial and individual differences in obesity and facilitate the development of effective treatments within and across racial groups according to the principles of individualized medicine. To our knowledge, racial differences in objectively-measured diet intake and energy expenditure in response to stress, or their underlying physiological mechanisms, have not been assessed in adolescents or adults. This is an important knowledge gap in our efforts to develop better evidence-based translational obesity prevention and weight-control interventions as the traditional interventions are not effective with minority youth. Obesity carries a substantial burden, and often develops in adolescence, persists into adult life and is almost twice as prevalent in African-American women compared to Caucasian women. We will test whether African- American girls consume more sweet and fatty foods and engage in less physical activity when stressed than Caucasians girls, and if stress hormones explain these differences. We will also test whether the differences in diet, activity and hormones account for the higher rates of obesity in African-American girls.","Ethnic Influences on Stress, Energy Balance and Obesity in Adolescents",9526080,R01MD010757,"['Abbreviations ', ' Accounting ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adrenal Glands ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Body Composition ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' Client ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' Family ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fasting ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Female ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' indexing ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Morbidity -

"Toxic Stress and Protective Factors in Multiethnic School Age Children PROJECT SUMMARY  A toxic stress response can result from exposure to extreme stressors in early childhood, such as poverty, violence or parental mental illness. Persistent elevation of the stress response system causes physiological disruptions that can result in alterations to brain architecture and neuroendocrine, immune, metabolic and cardiovascular functioning. Studies from animals and maltreated children demonstrate that the presence of a nurturing caregiver can buffer against the physiological disruptions associated with a toxic stress response; however, the specific positive caregiving characteristics that best promote a protective relationship in humans remain largely unexplored, particularly in families living in high-risk environments. Framed by an ecobiodevelopmental model, the proposed study employs a cross-sectional design to describe and examine relationships among past maternal experiences with caregiving, current caregiving patterns, and children's indicators of a toxic stress response in a multiethnic, urban sample of maternal-child dyads with children at early school age.  The first aim of this study is to describe physiological (hair cortisol, salivary c-reactive protein and inflammatory cytokines, blood pressure), health (body mass index, growth delay) and behavioral (internalizing and externalizing behaviors) indicators of a toxic stress response in children. The second aim of this study is to describe maternal caregiving characteristics in the sample, including past maternal experiences with caregiving (adverse childhood experiences, family strengths) and current caregiving patterns (parental reflective functioning, parenting behaviors). The third aim is to examine correlations among past maternal experiences with caregiving, current caregiving patterns, and indicators of a toxic stress response in children. The results of this study will provide essential preliminary data to support future studies designed to examine causal relationships between maternal characteristics and indicators of a toxic stress response in children, and may inform the development of interventions aiming to promote health and reduce disparities within families at risk for toxic stress. The proposed training plan includes coursework and a variety of scholarly and research activities to establish a strong foundation in nursing science and concepts related to the study, including maternal-child relationships, health disparities and social determinants of health. The training plan also includes specific experiences designed to promote extensive knowledge of the stress response system and develop my expertise in research methods, especially with complex families living in challenging community environments. Aligned with NINR's strategic plan to promote health and reduce disparities in minority and underserved populations, the proposed study and training plan will provide an essential foundation for a career in nursing research focused on investigating protective factors for toxic stress in families living with adversity. PROJECT RELEVANCE Exposure to stressful environments in early childhood can cause a toxic stress response, and subsequently lead to poor health outcomes including obesity, cardiac disease, diabetes and mental illness. The purpose of this study is to examine maternal caregiving characteristics that may protect against the physiological, health and behavioral indicators of a toxic stress response in children within families at high risk for exposure to stressors such as poverty, trauma or exposure to violence.",Toxic Stress and Protective Factors in Multiethnic School Age

"SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to experience negative health outcomes the longer they live in the U.S. For example, over time Hispanic immigrants engage in riskier behaviors such as substance abuse, violence, and risky sex, and experience more depressive symptoms. The stress associated with the acculturation process, acculturation stress, and resilience at the individual, family, community, and societal levels appear to play important roles in influencing risks. However, little is known about the causal mechanisms linking acculturation stress, resilience, and health outcomes among Hispanic immigrants. Further, little is known about what precise types of stressors (e.g., occupational stress vs. discrimination) and resilience factors (e.g., individual coping vs. family support) have the most important influence on health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants. The proposed longitudinal study (N = 385) will investigate the effects of acculturation stress and resilience on co-occurring substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV risk, and depression (i.e., syndemic conditions) and biological stress among young adult Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. More specifically, the proposed project aims to: 1) test theoretical links between the cumulative impact of acculturation stress and resilience on syndemic conditions and biological stress among recent young adult Hispanic immigrants over a two-year period, and 2) identify the specific types of acculturation stressors and resilience factors at the individual, family, community, and societal levels that are most important in predicting syndemic conditions and biological stress among this population over time. Young adult low-income Hispanic immigrant men and women within the first 10 years of immigration will be followed for two years. Biopsychosocial data will be collected from participants at baseline, and then 6 months (FU1), 12 months (FU2), 18 months (FU3), and 24 months later (FU4). Culturally specific measures of acculturation stress and resilience will be used to assess for individual, family, community, and societal risk and protective factors for syndemic conditions. Blood and urine samples will be obtained from participants to measure systemic inflammation (IL 6, IL8, and IL 18) and oxidative stress (F2 isoprostanes), previously validated biomarkers for psychological stress. Various descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistics, including latent growth curve modeling, will be used to address aims 1-2. The findings from this study have the potential to identify risk and protective factors for the decay in heath among Hispanic immigrants. A precise and culturally informed understanding of these phenomena is foundational for designing interventions that can ultimately promote the health and wellbeing of Hispanic immigrants, the largest immigrant group in the U.S. This study also has the potential to lay the theoretical foundation for biopsychosocial health disparities research in other populations. RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study seeks to describe the impact that acculturation stress and resilience plays in influencing behavioral, psychological, and biological health among young adult Hispanics who are recent immigrants. The findings from this study can inform interventions aiming to improve the health and well-being of Hispanic immigrants.","SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S.",9423750,R01MD012249,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Ants ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Immigration ', ' Inflammation ', ' Language ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Healing ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Panic ', ' parity ', ' Perception ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Wit ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Isoprostanes ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' Cyamopsis ', ' Guar ', ' Cyamposis ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' IL8 gene ', ' b-ENAP ', ' TSG-1 ', ' SCYB8 ', ' MONAP ', ' MDNCF ', ' LYNAP ', ' LUCT ', ' K60 ', ' IL8 ', ' IL-8 ', ' GCP1 ', ' CXCL8 ', ' AMCF-I ', ' 3-10C ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' healing ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' family support ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,753137,0.10393957536364046
"Social Stressors and Inflammation: A Mixed Methods Approach to Preterm Birth African American women have 1.5 times the rates of preterm birth (PTB)(<37 weeks completed gestation) compared with non-Hispanic white women. This disproportionately high PTB rate in African Americans is a persistent health inequity that leads to high child mortality, morbidity, and developmental delays. In the U.S. approximately $26 billion are spent annually on health care costs for infants and children that were born prematurely. Recent attempts to explain the high PTB rates in African American women have focused on social stressors, such as disadvantaged neighborhoods, racial discrimination, and stressful life events. These social stressors may lead to PTB by increasing women's emotional stress levels. Not surprisingly, emotional stress along with levels of the stress hormone cortisol and systemic inflammation - both physiological responses to stress - have all been related to higher risk of PTB. In contrast, one's psychosocial resources (e.g., social support) can lessen emotional stress and have protective effects on PTB. Little is yet known about the pathways by which social stressors affect inflammation, and ultimately PTB. The objective of the proposed study is to determine how social stressors alter inflammation during pregnancy and lead to PTB in African American women. We aim to: 1) determine the pathways by which social stressors affect PTB; and 2) describe social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; the associations among these concepts; and their impact on PTB from women's perspectives.  In this longitudinal convergent mixed methods design, we will enroll 1,500 African American women who live in the Detroit metropolitan area. We will collect data on social stressors, emotional stress, and psychosocial resources through questionnaires and administrative (e.g., census) data. This will be done three times prenatally. At these same time points, levels of cortisol and systemic inflammation will be determined from hair and blood samples, respectively. We will also obtain birth data from the prenatal and hospital records. In a subsample of 60 women, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to more specifically understand the associations among social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; and their impact on PTB. We will conduct a variety of statistical, qualitative and mixed methods analyses using both quantitative and qualitative data to determine answers to the aims of our study. We will also consider the timing of pregnancy in our analyses, as the prenatal data are collected at three distinct time points. The proposed research is highly relevant to NIH's mission to elucidate mechanisms underlying health disparities in PTB. Insights gained from this mixed methods approach may lead to the development of an individualized PTB risk profile based on a woman's social stressors and biomarkers which will have potential use in clinical practice and be a target for culturally appropriate interventions to reduce PTB incidence in African American women, and will generate new perspectives for future research in other racial groups through our detailed focus on this high risk group. Preterm birth is a major risk for neonatal mortality and long-term child health problems, including motor and mental developmental delays and chronic illness. Knowledge of the social context of African American women's lives will increase our understanding of why some women have poor pregnancy outcomes, generate new perspectives for future research, inform new lines of inquiry regarding the pathways through which stress affects preterm birth in other racial groups, contribute to the development of culturally appropriate interventions to reduce racial disparities in preterm birth, and ultimately improve birth outcomes.",Social Stressors and Inflammation: A Mixed Methods Approach to Preterm Birth,9469090,R01MD011575,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anxiety ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Child Mortality ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospital Records ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' newborn mortality ', ' newborn death ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' Interleukin 10 Precursor ', ' IL10A ', ' IL10 ', ' IL-10 ', ' Cytokine Synthesis Inhibitory Factor ', ' CSIF-10 ', ' CSIF ', ' Interleukin-10 ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Specific Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Delay ', ' Developmental Delay Disorders ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' Mediating ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' Premature Birth ', ' base ', ' Blood Sample ', ' Blood specimen ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Prenatal Structures ', ' psychosocial ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Motor ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' protective effect ', ' high risk ', ' pregnant ', ' effective intervention ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' clinical practice ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' improved outcome ', ' 37 weeks gestation ', ' 37 weeks completed gestation ', ' neighborhood disadvantage ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIMHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,764930,0.05274904423168525
"Race, Stress and Dysregulated Eating: Maternal to Child Transmission of Obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing racial disparity in obesity has reached a critical juncture, particularly among black and white females. Obesity is now being perpetuated across generations. While there is uncertainty about how best to prevent obesity and the related racial disparities, converging lines of evidence support the influence of stress on obesity. We hypothesize that income and race are associated with higher levels of both objective and perceived stress, which in turn are associated with higher rates of dysregulated eating, a behavior posited to result in an increased rate of obesity. Finally, we propose that stress has a direct effect on the level of obesity in the offspring. We propose to model these relationships longitudinally using the National Growth and Healthy Study (NGHS) that enrolled equal numbers of black and white girls and that contains extensive measures of life stress, nonhomeostatic eating, household demographic and socioeconomic indicators and cardiometabolic risk factors for black and white girls initially sampled at age 10 and interviewed annually until age 20. We will extend these data, adding a new wave of data collection for the women who are now 36 and their children. We will interview participants regarding their current levels of stress, household food insecurity, dysregulated eating behaviors such as dietary restraint and overeating, and collect data on dietary intake and physical activity. We will collect measured weight and central adiposity and clinical measures of metabolic syndrome on both the women and their children. Building on the rich source of longitudinal data that NGHS provides, we will model relationships between these factors and weight status from early childhood to adulthood among these women and their children in order to examine the effects of cumulative stress, eating behaviors and obesity on obesity in the next generation. The study aims to test the hypotheses that: 1) stress and dysregulated eating results in an increased rate of obesity, exacerbated by food insecurity; 2) maternal stress and dysregulated eating have a direct effect on the level of obesity and markers of metabolic syndrome in offspring; and, 3) race and income are associated with higher levels of stress and dysregulated eating in women. Our preliminary data suggests that stress leads to excessive weight gain ten years later in the NGHS cohort. We will identify predictors of weight gain trajectories from childhood to adulthood. These constructs have the potential to lead to promising interventions coupled with traditional diet and physical activity components that will help girls and women throughout the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing black/white disparities and the perpetuation of obesity across generations has reached a critical juncture, particularly among girls and women. The current proposal seeks to add a new wave of data collection to survey participants regarding current stress factors, household food insecurity, and non-homeostatic eating such as restrained and drive to overeat and evaluate the relationships between these factors and weight gain trajectories in a longitudinal cohort of girls followed from age 10 to 36 years. We believe that this approach will identify modifiable stress-based factors that can be incorporated into intervention trials leading to sustained changes in children's and women's weight trajectories.","Race, Stress and Dysregulated Eating: Maternal to Child Transmission of Obesity",9414753,R01HD073568,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Behavior ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Data Collection ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Mothers ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight ', ' Weights and Measures ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' base ', ' Body Measures ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Body fat ', ' Life ', ' Calories ', ' Source ', ' waist circumference ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' next generation ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' Coupled ', ' 16 year old ', ' sixteen years of age ', ' sixteen year old ', ' age 16 years ', ' 16 years of age ', ' public health relevance ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' cardio-metabolic risk ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' black/white disparity ', ' maternal obesity ', ' maternal weight ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2017,100000,0.055760971475478135
"The effects of lifetime stress on cognitive aging in the context of HIV-infection: Identifying sources of racial disparities Project Summary  Racial disparities exist in cognitive aging, and it has been established that long-term HIV disease accelerates cognitive aging processes. African Americans (AAs) are a particularly vulnerable group, and our preliminary data indicate that HIV+ AAs demonstrate worse cognitive and brain imaging outcomes than HIV+ EAs even after controlling for confounding factors. We do not know if these disparities persist over time, and the reasons for racial disparities in cognitive outcomes remains unclear. It is well-known that lifetime exposure to stress, which is associated with HIV-infection and AA race, influences cognitive outcomes. Thus, we hypothesize that lifetime stress is a mechanism that places HIV+ AAs at risk for poor cognitive outcomes. Peripheral inflammation has been linked to cognitive impairment in several studies, and is increased in association with HIV, AA race, and lifetime stress. Prospective studies are needed to determine if HIV, lifetime stress exposure and AA race results in premature cognitive aging via increased inflammation. The present study will address this gap in knowledge by examining rates of change in cognitive function and cortical and subcortical brain structures in a cohort of 250 older adults (50+) with and without HIV infection stratified by ethnicity (AA vs. EA). We will also address the gaps in the current stress and disparities literature by using a comprehensive measure of stress and adversity over the lifespan (i.e., Stress and Adversity Inventory [STRAIN]). The STRAIN will allow us to capture stressors that have occurred over an individual's lifetime as well as new stressors during the course of the study. We will examine how recent stress exposure is associated with changes in inflammation and cognitive/brain outcomes. This study is highly significant, as no study to date has examined racial disparities in risk for cognitive declines in HIV-seropositive individuals.  We will use state-of-the art methods for measuring brain changes by following up on a cohort of older (aged 50+) HIV+ and HIV- individuals from a previous NIH supported study. Structural neuroimaging will be used to examine longitudinal changes in morphometry and regional connectivity. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the prospective change in brain/cognitive function in HIV+ and HIV- adults stratified by AA and EA race. Our secondary aim is to determine how lifetime stress differs as a function of HIV status and race. Our third aim will examine how life stress is associated with prospective changes in cognition/brain structure. Finally, we will examine associations between recent life stress and changes in inflammation, and how these changes in inflammation influence cognitive/brain outcomes. This project brings together the skills of several research groups at UCLA, and builds upon existing collaborations and resources. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to evaluate cognitive aging in a large cohort of HIV+ and HIV- AA and EA older adults. At the end of this study we expect to discern the relative contributions of AA and HIV-specific processes as these unfold via inflammatory processes that increase vulnerability to premature aging. Project Narrative  Racial disparities exist in the context of HIV-infection; of particular importance is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. African Americans (with and without HIV) are more likely than European Americans to demonstrate poor cognitive outcomes, but the reasons are unclear. This novel project integrates methods of neuroscience and immunology to determine whether HIV-infection and African American race confer risks for cognitive impairments, and whether poor cognitive outcomes result from stress exposure and inflammation.",The effects of lifetime stress on cognitive aging in the context of HIV-infection: Identifying sources of racial

"Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health problems are proportionately affect racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as populations that face chronic economic hardship (Evans, Wolf & Adler, 2012). There is clear evidence that (1) the processes that lay the groundwork for mental health disparities is laid during childhood (e.g., Chen & Miller, 2012) and (2) that damage to and dysregulation of the physiologic stress response is a powerful mechanism of the effects of chronic stress such as that associated with poverty on psychopathology (e.g., Evans & Kim, 2012). To contribute solutions to mental health disparities, we need interventions capable of affecting the systems that confer the risk. Since the psychobiologic stress response system (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis; HPA) is a central mechanism linking health disparities to chronic stress, the stress response is a critical system to target. Improving children's ability to cope with stress and regulate their reactivity ha the potential to break the cycle of damage, especially if the coping strategies and regulatory processes that we target have effects at the physiologic level. Preliminary evidence from the PIs research lab has emerged showing that different types of coping are evident at the level of the HPA-it is, therefore, time to evaluate whether a coping intervention designed for children facing chronic stress will both (a) improve children's ability to use primary and secondary control coping, and (b) have sustained effects at the physiologic level. We have developed just such an intervention, which builds on these exciting new findings and is designed to address core underlying mechanisms of risk and repair in the highly stressful context of poor, urban youths' lives.  Preadolescence is a crucial time during which children's ability to recognize stress and it causes matures, and repertoires for coping with stress grow in both size and complexity. In addition, preadolescence is a time of increased brain changes and growth in key self-regulatory organs and systems. Preadolescents are, therefore, at a ripe stage to benefit from coping-based prevention and the plasticity of this developmental period suggests that such changes have the potential to be long-lasting. Our new prevention program is designed to prevent the onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in preadolescent children facing chronic stress. Two mechanisms of action are targeted in this project. First, the project seeks to demonstrate that children facing chronic stress stemming from poverty, discrimination, and violence exposure can acquire and utilize new ways of coping that are adaptive in a wide variety of circumstances. Second, the project will examine the extent to which improved coping resulting from the intervention engages the physiologic intermediate mechanism of the HPA. Finally, the project aims to link changes in coping and the HPA to changes in internalizing symptoms that would signal prevention of the emergence of new or worsening of existing symptoms. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system that leads to psychopathology can offer new directions for combatting health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and socioeconomic disparities in physical and mental health problems are large, persistent, and severe; begin during childhood; and stem from in part damage to physiologic stress response systems caused by chronic stress. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system may offer new directions for combatting health disparities. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a new prevention program designed to teach preadolescent children effective ways for coping with chronic stress that will have direct effects on their physiologic stress response systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and ultimately prevent onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms and disorders.",Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress,9459045,R21MH107631,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Wolves ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' preadolescence ', ' preteen ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenic ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' R21/R33 Program ', ' R21/R33 Mechanism ', ' Phased Innovation Awards ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' stem ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' intervention effect ', ' coping mechanism ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' violence victimization ', ' racial minority ', ' psychological symptom ', ' stress symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' ']",NIMH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R21,2017,39627,0.18156684209296528
"A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this study is to determine how different trajectories of minority stress experienced throughout adolescence may predict behavioral health outcomes for SMA. Relying on methods established and tested in our preliminary work, we will recruit a national sample of diverse SMA (e.g., race and ethnicity, gender, urban vs. rural; N = 1,500) through both social media and respondent-driven sampling strategies in the first year of the project. We will follow participants for three years, incorporating the fundamental tenets of developmental psychopathology, which suggest that examining risk and protective factors for adolescents necessitates longitudinal exploration across critical stages of development. Guiding the proposal are three specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the individual and group trajectories of minority stress over time by following a national sample of SMA (N = 1,500) for 3 years. WH1: There will be differences in minority stress across adolescent development. Aim 2: Determine whether trajectories of minority stress are associated with differences in behavioral health outcomes over time. WH2.1: Trajectories of minority stress and behavioral health outcomes will be associated over time. WH2.2: Reporting higher levels of minority stress in early adolescence will be associated with poorer behavioral health outcomes in later adolescence. Aim 3: Determine whether the association between minority stress and behavioral health over time is different based on sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., urbanicity, gender, race and ethnicity). WH3: There will be significant differences in outcome trajectories by demographic subgroup. WH4: Trajectories of minority stress will be inversely associated with protective factors over time and will differ by demographic subgroup. To test our hypotheses, we propose cutting-edge longitudinal quantitative methodology including latent growth-curve modeling, which are rarely used to examine longitudinal risk among SMAs. The proposed research will be the first to determine how minority stress may influence health across adolescence, and this information can be used directly to inform clinical assessment and the development of targeted behavioral health interventions for this high-need population. Project Narrative Sexual minority adolescents (SMA; adolescents who report a same-sex sexual orientation) are at much higher risk for behavioral health concerns than their heterosexual peers, yet little is known about how different patterns of gay-related stress over time impacts mental/behavioral health outcomes. The proposed research is to examine the individual and group trajectories of sexual minority adolescents (ages 14 to 17 at baseline) and examine how differences in these trajectories predict behavioral health outcomes. The resulting knowledge can be used to inform clinical assessment and the development of effective targeted behavioral health interventions to reduce the behavioral health disparities found in this high need population.",A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents,9424462,R01MD012252,"['Academy ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Marshal ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' life history ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' early adolescence ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' Same-sex ', ' social media ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,788986,0.07466901078672034
"Resilient Profiles and College Adjustment Among Students PROJECT SUMMARY  Especially for racial/ethnic minority youth, a college degree can offer a pathway towards better wellbeing across the lifespan. Although many biracial students experience positive adjustment in college and go on to earn a college degree, over 35% of biracial students who begin college fail to earn a degree within 6 years. The lack of a college degree can have significant economic costs, and failure to complete a college degree can initiate a cascade of mental and physical effects. Biracial students may encounter unique stressors in college, such as discrimination, difficulty finding a place to “fit”, and forming and shifting their identity across contexts and time. Stress can impair emotional, social, and academic adjustment; when chronic, stress can also cumulatively affect physiology via a process commonly termed allostatic load, affecting long-term mental and physical health. Despite these risks, biracial students may have access to unique sources of resilience, promoting positive adjustment. However, we have little understanding of factors that promote resilience among biracial youth transitioning to college.  The proposed study will use a longitudinal approach to examine stress and resilience among biracial White/Hispanic college students. The project provides a chance to engage with this understudied population. Questionnaire and physiological data will be used to identify risk and resilient profiles of psychological, physiological, social, and cultural resources, which may promote or impair adjustment of biracial college students. The project will assess how these profiles affect stress, allostatic load, and trajectories of college adjustment over the first year of college. With the rapid growth of the biracial population in the U.S., filling gaps in research knowledge will help promote wellbeing among biracial individuals in college and into adulthood. An investigation of profiles of psychological, physiological, social, and cultural resilience resources is well-placed for translation into later preventative and intervention efforts with this understudied population.   PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite the rapid growth of the biracial population, little work has been done to investigate sources of risk or resilience as biracial students adjust to the challenging college environment. An investigation of how profiles of psychological, physiological, social, and cultural resilience resources predict trajectories of stress and adjustment among biracial college students may inform prevention and intervention efforts to boost and maintain wellbeing among this rapidly-growing segment of the U.S. population.  ",Resilient Profiles and College Adjustment Among Students,9397386,F31HD090917,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Emotions ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Physiology ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Socialization ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Policies ', ' Immigrant ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' respiratory ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' trait ', ' peer ', ' economic cost ', ' cultural values ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Drops ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' allostatic load ', ' rapid growth ', ' resilience ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' high risk ', ' peer support ', ' biracial ', ' minority student ', ' racial identity ', ' ethnic identity ', ' ']",NICHD,ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY-TEMPE CAMPUS,F31,2017,42188,0.02936002783555338
"Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent research suggests that chronic early life stress may pose serious threats to child well-being and set individuals on pathways towards increased physical and mental health problems in adulthood. In addition to being a key health input across the life course, chronic stress is produced through individuals' responses to their environments and thus reflects the interaction of social contexts with biological processes. Improving population health and reducing health disparities necessitates that we understand these socio-biological interactions, particularly during the early stages of the life course when physiological changes may become biologically embedded.  This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in Population Research application addresses this critical research need by proposing a training plan and research agenda that will build on my sociology, family demography and child health background to become an independent, innovative researcher in the area of social contexts, chronic stress and health during childhood. To achieve this goal, I propose formal training and mentoring in the biology of stress, collection and analysi of stress biomarkers, child development, and multilevel modeling. My highly-qualified team of mentors and advisory committee members come from the fields of sociology, demography, epidemiology, nursing, and psychology, reflecting the need for a multi- disciplinary approach in conducting research that integrates biological and social processes.  I will use my training and mentoring in these new areas to answer important research questions about how family contexts are associated with chronic stress in children, and the implications of chronic stress for child health and health disparities in the U.S. In the past four decades, there have been large and pervasive shifts in children's family contexts towards unmarried and unstable parental unions, which are often accompanied by socioeconomic disadvantage. Research suggests that these contexts contribute to child health and development disadvantages and the reproduction of social inequalities across generations. However, there has been little attention to assessing chronic stress as a pathway through which family contexts affect child health.  The expected outcome of this project is paradigm-shifting research that incorporates biological mechanisms into our conceptualization and empirical tests of family context effects on child well-being. Importantly, the conclusions will go beyond a comparison of married vs. unmarried mother families to consider diverse family structures and processes as they impact child stress and health. Using multilevel and population-based data will advance our understanding of the influence of larger social contexts (i.e., neighborhoods and social status) on these processes and will provide generalizable results. These are critical next steps in child health, family demography, and stress research that will set the stage for future research and policy development aimed at reducing chronic stress and health disparities in children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children's family environments have changed dramatically over the past 40 years in the U.S., with potentially important implications for their stress and health. Adverse or unstable family contexts may produce chronic stress in children due to the need for predictability in family relationships and adequate resources (of all types) for healthy child development. Chronic stress, in turn, may pose threats to children's physical, emotional and cognitive development. Understanding the extent to which increasingly diverse and unstable family environments are associated with chronic stress in children, and delineating pathways linking family structure, stress and child outcomes, are important next steps in family demography and child health research. This research will further our understanding of the role of family structure and instability as social determinants of child stress, and biological mechanisms through which family contexts contribute to the reproduction of health and social inequalities.","Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children",9292053,K01HD077063,"['population health ', ' cognitive development ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Demography ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Policies ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' single motherhood ', ' Unmarried Mother ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Family Demographies ', ' Mediating ', ' Unmarried ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' family structure ', ' social inequality ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiology Nursing ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Family Process ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' family influence ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' ']",NICHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,128450,0.20736118272593346
"Stress and Unintended Pregnancy in Adolescence and Young Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent and young adult women in the U.S., especially racial/ethnic minority and poor young women, have high rates of early and unintended pregnancy, which are associated with a host of adverse outcomes. While proximal and distal determinants of fertility have been widely studied, little research has focused on the role of stress in unintended pregnancy.  Stress is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality and a key mechanism that links social context and health disparities. The biological and psychological processes of stress may affect the pathways to unintended pregnancy, but this has not been addressed in reproductive health research. Moreover, how social determinants of stress shape young women's risk of unintended pregnancy is unknown. To improve our knowledge of the complex, interrelated determinants of unintended pregnancy and to advance reproductive health scholarship at the intersection of biological and social processes (i.e. biosocial), this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award focuses on the important but understudied role of stress in unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood. So that I may conduct cutting-edge research in this area, I propose career development training to: 1) learn sociological theories, concepts, and methods for studying unintended pregnancy and stress; 2) build competency in bio demographic research methods and their application to fertility research; 3) attain a more nuanced understanding of the theory and research on the biology of stress and fecund ability; and 4) become proficient in advanced multilevel, longitudinal, and mediational statistical methods required for modeling the life course of and pathways between stress and unintended pregnancy. The corresponding K01 research project will: 1) estimate how trajectories of stress relate to unintended pregnancy; 2) investigate relationships between social determinants of stress (social stressors), stress trajectories, and unintended pregnancy; and 3) explore the biological processes (e.g., neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and immune) through which stress influences unintended pregnancy, during adolescence and young adulthood. To assist with the K01 training and research plans, I have assembled a strong multidisciplinary advisory board comprised of esteemed scholars, including mentor Jennifer Barber PhD, co-mentor Kathleen Mullan Harris PhD, scientific advisors Ana Diez Roux MD PhD, Timothy Johnson MD, and Julia Seng PhD MSN, and statistical consultant Yu Xie PhD. The University of Michigan Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Institute for Social Research and The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health and Carolina Population Center will provide the infrastructures to support these activities. This K01 will establish me as an independent investigator poised to conduct new biosocial studies of fertility and ultimately lead innovative, interdisciplinary research efforts to improve outcomes an reduce disparities in young women's reproductive health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood is a persistent public health problem with negative implications for young women, their offspring, and society. Stress, which is prevalent across the reproductive life course and is a contributor to morbidity, mortality, and health disparities, has been understudied in reproductive health research. Using an innovative, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary approach, this study will provide new insights into the biosocial processes of stress that shape the risk of unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood, and findings will help identify reproductive health services, programs, and policies to improve reproductive outcomes and reduce disparities among young women.",Stress and Unintended Pregnancy in Adolescence and Young Adulthood,9271980,K01HD080722,"['Miscarriage ', ' Spontaneous abortion ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Barbering ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' Biology ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Family Planning ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Gynecology ', ' Hazard Models ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity -

"Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child Biology and Behavior DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite considerable evidence documenting the effects of prenatal maternal stress and emotions on birth and early child outcomes, the biological pathways by which maternal stress is transferred to children are not yet well understood. The proposed study will test a set of novel hypotheses about maternal stress and allostatic load (physiological dysregulation across multiple systems due to cumulative wear-and-tear associated with chronic and acute stress exposure) during the preconception and prenatal periods. The study focuses primarily on HPA axis regulatory mechanisms in a sample of 201 diverse mother-child pairs, particularly the prediction of child neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress regulation at ages 2 and 3 and cellular aging (indexed by telomere length) in both young children and their mothers. Our inclusion of the preconception period is innovative and yields a more comprehensive understanding of developmental origins (including fetal programming) of later health and developmental competence. One overall objective is to identify modifiable risk factors that can be targeted for early effective prevention of adverse health, neurocognitive, and behavioral outcomes throughout the lifespan.  Participants will be recruited from an enrolled cohort of ethnically diverse, mostly low-income women in Washington, DC and Lake County, IL near Chicago as part of a large multi-site NIH collaborative study (Child Community Health Network Study; CCHN). The parent study includes extensive interview measures of maternal stress in preconception and pregnancy and maternal biomarkers that pose risk for disease in the next generation, creating a unique opportunity to examine prospective predictors of child outcomes. The specific aims are to examine effects of maternal stress and allostatic load, especially HPA regulation during preconception and in pregnancy on outcomes at ages 2 and 3. The outcomes are: (1) children's cortisol responses to acute laboratory stressors and circadian regulation of cortisol production; (2) children's fearful or anxious temperament measured by innovative observational laboratory testing; (3) children's neurocognitive functioning using standardized assessments; (4) children's leukocyte telomere length at age 2 and rates of shortening from ages 2 to 3. We will also examine leukocyte telomere length of mothers as a function of stress and test for mother-child associations.  RELEVANCE: This study addresses an NICHD research priority in 2011 to identify developmental origins of susceptibility to later health, disease, and longevity. Results will provide the first evidence about plausible biological pathways prior to pregnancy that, in turn, program prenatal and postnatal development, taking into consideration many other known environmental and biological influences. The findings have the potential to yield new understanding about the pervasive, serious maternal and child health disparities that extend throughout the lifespan and disproportionately impact low income, minority populations. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Adult diseases with developmental origins including neurocognitive disorders are estimated to take an immense toll on our nation's health. The proposed research will prospectively investigate whether maternal factors in the preconception period and in pregnancy, especially stress and HPA regulatory mechanisms, alter the behavioral, stress regulatory and neurocognitive outcomes of young children, as well as effects on cellular aging processes in mother-child pairs. Findings will provide a new foundation for developing potentially powerful preventive interventions to improve children's lifelong well-being.",Preconception and Prenatal Stress: Pathways to Child

"Longevity and Stress in African American Families Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this application is to identify patterns of perceived stress, active coping style, health status and genes that contribute to longevity observed within African American families. We will examine these factors using vertical and horizontal approaches by studying similarities between siblings and parent-child pairs. To this end, we have the following questions:  1) Do familial effects (genes and shared environments) create similarity in the patterns of perceived tress and coping within and across generations?  2) Does stress account for differences in patterns of longevity between families?  3) Do psychosocial factors like stress, coping, and discrimination account for differences in patterns of health status and longevity between families?  4) What role do genes play in patterns of stress and longevity?  5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? To address these research questions, we have planned five specific aims: 1) Collect data from 750 older African Americans on perceptions of stress, discrimination, coping style, health, personality and genetics from multi-generation families (parent-child and siblings). 2) Examine similarities and differences in stress and coping, and health status among sibling pairs and across generations within families. 3) Compare the health status of siblings concordant for higher stress and poorer coping to those with lower stress and better coping. 4) Examine genes associated with stress and longevity in comparisons of long lived families and short lived families and among sibling pairs. 5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? This project is novel and innovative in that it will employ a multi method approach to understand longevity. It will use a quantitative genetic approach, a molecular genetic approach, and a multi generation approach. To our knowledge, this is the first time all of these methods have been employed on one sample. Relevance/Project Narrative This project will significantly contribute to our understanding the biobehavioral complex of factors that leads to healthy aging by examining genetic and environmental factors related to stress. ",Longevity and Stress in African American Families,9353714,R01AG054363,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Personality ', ' Play ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Siblings ', ' Stress ', ' survivorship ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Survivors ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' care systems ', ' longevity gene ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Heritability ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' genetic approach ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' ']",NIA,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,705045,0.14043991092693303
"Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women are disproportionately affected by systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and also face worse consequences of disease activity. This proposed study is important to helping improve our understanding of how psychosocial stressors that are salient in the lives of African American women, and in particular experiences of racial discrimination, exacerbate SLE severity and progression. Accomplishing the specific aims of this research will help to unravel factors contributing to racial disparities in this understudied disease, and will also help to identify potential targets of intervention?",Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women,9264989,R01AR065493,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Buffers ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family Relations ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Linear Models ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Spottings ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' chronic autoimmune disease ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' Lupus ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' public health relevance ', ' minimally invasive ', ' population based ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' longitudinal design ', ' social health determinants ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial minority ', ' racial identity ', ' ']",NIAMS,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R01,2017,530045,0.07630552075158208
"Social Determinants of Inflammation and Metabolic Syndrom among African Americans DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recent years, strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation (INF) and metabolic syndrome (MS) represent dysregulated biological systems that predict onset of chronic, age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, and dementia. Although a wealth of findings has indicated that psychosocial stress is a major determinant of INF and MS, a number of crucial questions remain unanswered. First, we do not know whether sensitive period (early biological programming), stress accumulation, social schematic, or mismatch models best account for the development of INF and MS. Second, we have little information regarding the range of stressors within a developmental period that are most critical. Studies of childhood stress usually simply assess low SES or exposure to harsh parenting, and these measurements typically entail retrospective reports. Research on the effect of adult stress sometimes includes community context but usually fails to consider the way that childhood stress may moderate reactions to adult stressors. And, whether the focus is childhood or adult adversity, there has been limited consideration of the way that race-related stressors such as segregation, perceived racism, discrimination, and internalized racism impact biological dysregulation. Third, we know little about the extent to which factors such as parental support, racial socialization, social support, or religiosity operate to reduce the deleterious impact of childhood, adolescent, or adult stressors on INF and MS. A final limitation of past research is that it has focused, with a few exceptions, on White samples whereas African Americans display significantly higher rates of almost every type of chronic illness and score higher on biomarkers of INF and most indictors of MS. In order to address these unanswered questions and limitations, this application seeks funding to add biomarkers of INF and MS, as well as telephone interview data regarding stress and health behaviors, to the 18 years of longitudinal data that has been collected on the Family and Community Health Study (FACHS) sample of roughly 700 African Americans (now 28 years of age). Specifically, we plan to pursue the following specific aims: 1) identify the cluster of SE- and race-related stressors experienced in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood that best predict adult INF and MS. 2) Use these stress indices to test competing models regarding the manner in which stressors from various developmental periods combine to influence biological dysregulaton. And, 3) investigate the extent to which the experience of supportive parenting and racial socialization during childhood, and/or supportive relationships and religiosity during adulthood, are moderating factors that promote healthy biomarkers for INF and MS. There are few, if any, efficacious preventive interventions that address the causes of health disparities. The Institute of Medicine prescribes that such efforts be based on the results of longitudinal, epidemiological research with target populations. Currently, there are no prospective investigations that identify the protective factors that interrupt the translation of social determinants of stress into biological vulnerabilities for African Americans. The results of the proposed research will identify protective processes and serve as the basis for empirically-based, health disparities preventive interventions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving the quality of longer lives requires information regarding the causes of age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and dementia. In recent years, strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation and metabolic syndrome represent dysregulated biological systems that predict onset of these illnesses.

"Childhood Family Instability, Adult Stress Reactivity, and Consequences for Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The family environments in which children are born and raised have a profound influence on their behavior, education, and health (Amato 2001; Cherlin 1999; McLanahan & Sandefur 2009). With the overlapping demographic and social trends of later age at marriage, greater acceptability of divorce and non-marital childbearing, and more cohabitation, the landscape of American families is diverse and dynamic. According to the recent Census, 29% of American children live with only one biological parent, and 3.5% reside with neither biological parent (Vespa et al. 2013). Such cross-sectional estimates, however, belie the true complexity and dynamism of family structures. Not only do children increasingly live in diverse family forms, but the childhood experience of family structure is dynamic, with children likely to live in a variety of families by the time they reach adulthood (Cavanagh & Huston 2006; Graefe & Lichter 1999; Heuveline et al. 2003).  Using nationally representative integrated demographic, social, contextual and biological data on children in the United States, the proposed study will trace the biological pathways through which childhood family instability influences adult health. The Investigator hypothesizes that family instability creates intense and chronic stress that will be evident in measures of adult stress reactivity and that have negative long-term health consequences. The project will evaluate the importance of instability during sensitive developmental stages of early childhood and adolescence, and investigate gender, race and ethnic differences in stress response processes. This project contributes to the field by examining the enduring health consequences of childhood exposure to dynamic family structures, a common life experience for today's children. Findings will further our understanding of the ways in which the social environment ""gets under the skin"" to influence physiological functioning and biological processes that have consequences for health. Knowledge gained from this project will help more effectively target child welfare policies to crucial developmental periods, and to better understand and reduce health disparities.  An interdisciplinary team of dedicated and highly skilled mentors developed a personalized training plan to support the Investigator in pursuit of her research and career goals. To accomplish the proposed research, the Investigator requires additional substantive and technical training in biology to be achieved through coursework, guided reading, seminars and workshops. The Investigator's professional development will be supported by strengthening her publication record, as well as her grant writing and communication skills. These activities will provide the Investigator with the training necessary to develop expertise in biosocial research and engage in productive interdisciplinary research at the intersection of social and biomedical sciences. The training will also facilitate the Investigator's transition to independent research, and enable her to attain her career goal of securing a faculty position at a leading research university.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this research project is to understand the biological pathways through which childhood family instability influences adult health, testing the role of stress reactivity. The project will evaluate the importance of instability during early childhood and adolescence, and investigate gender, race and ethnic differences in stress response. The results of this project will further our understanding of how the social environments in which we live are biologically embedded, affecting biological processes that often have no immediate outward health consequences but do biological damage for years before disease is manifest.            ","Childhood Family Instability, Adult Stress Reactivity, and Consequences for Health",9391451,F32HD084117,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communication ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Divorced state ', ' Divorce ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Life Experience ', ' Literature ', ' Marriage ', ' Marriage Ages ', ' age at marriage ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Parents ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' career ', ' Family Study ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' The Sun ', ' sun ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' fetal ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' family structure ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' Biosocial ', ' family influence ', ' biological research ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adolescence ', ' Secure ', ' stress reactivity ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F32,2017,1800,0.09775782086427671
"The Effects of Social Networks on Women's Substance Use Disorder Recovery Outcomes ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychological stress is a causal factor in the pathogenesis of substance use disorder (SUD) and relapse risk. Low-income women report high levels of stress in SUD residential treatment stemming from significant economic and family stressors in addition to challenges adjusting to residential treatment demands. Unmanaged stress, especially in early stages of residential treatment, is a major concern because it can increase dropout. Dropout from residential treatment places women at risk of substance use relapse. A gap in knowledge persists regarding the use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) with racially and ethnically diverse low-income women with SUDs, especially regarding the efficacy of adapted MBIs for preventing residential dropout and decreasing relapse. The long-term goal of this application is to improve treatment outcomes in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women with SUDs by targeting stress, residential dropout, and relapse. We have fully adapted, developed, and pilot tested a novel MBI, Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery: Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention for Women (MBRP-W), that supports the needs of women in residential treatment. It showed promising results in substance use and perceived stress outcomes and no racial or ethnic differences in outcomes. This MBI integrates relapse prevention, addresses literacy level, and is relevant to issues surrounding treatment- and relapse-related stressors of disadvantaged women. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to test the efficacy of MBRP-W on residential treatment (a) retention and (b) substance use relapse in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women to determine; (2) the mechanisms of change underlying the MBRP-W program; and (3) if changes in hair cortisol as a marker of chronic stress provide a more powerful measure of stress compared to self- reported stress as a mechanism of change. A rationale for MBRP-W is the need for self-initiated stress management skills in women with SUDs during the early stressful periods of residential treatment that increase risk of dropout and relapse. The unique strengths of this application are its focus on underserved populations, residential dropout, and relapse outcomes, and the first-ever inclusion of a chronic stress biomarker in MBI research in the form of hair cortisol. The proposed work is innovative in that it intends to reduce stress in women to improve both retention and relapse outcomes. The expected results will define a viable integrative treatment that can improve stress management skills and treatment outcomes and will evaluate the utility of a biomarker of chronic stress. Results of this study will have a positive impact on substance use recovery outcomes in diverse groups of low-income women and identify mechanisms of action to inform future SUD treatment. The project's public health impact meets NIDA goals because it intends to prevent the escalation of addiction and its health consequences by offering a novel treatment accessible to undeserved women that is expected to decrease addiction-related racial and ethnic and gender-based health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 25 million Americans struggle with alcohol or drug problems annually. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is costly to our nation, exacting more than $428 billion in costs related to crime, lost work productivity and health care. While effective treatments exist, over half of those who enter treatment for substance use disorders drop out early in treatment and return to alcohol or drug abuse. The proposed research addresses this public health problem directly by testing an innovative approach to increasing treatment retention and reducing relapse among a diverse and underserved group of women.",The Effects of Social Networks on Women's Substance Use Disorder Recovery Outcomes,9387313,R01DA038648,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Award ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Crime ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Dropout ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Economics ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hybrids ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' literacy ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Productivity ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Registries ', ' Relapse ', ' Research ', ' Residential Treatment ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Social Network ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Recovery ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' American ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' disorder later incidence prevention ', ' relapse prevention ', ' recurrence prevention ', ' disorder recurrence prevention ', ' disease recurrence prevention ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Drops ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' research data dissemination ', ' research dissemination ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Drug Abuse ', ' National Institute on Drug Abuse ', ' NIDA ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' cost ', ' computerized ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based program ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' trial comparing ', ' stem ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' mindfulness ', ' efficacy testing ', ' distress tolerance ', ' attentional control ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' relapse risk ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2017,113163,0.0014718616753574382
"Epigenomic Predictors of PTSD and Traumatic Stress in an African American Cohort PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating mental disorder that has a profound public health impact and for which the disease burden falls disproportionately on African Americans (AAs). Socially adverse experiences of discrimination and isolation, stressful life events, and low socioeconomic position (SEP) have a profound impact on mental and physical health, with AAs being more likely to encounter many of these exposures; yet how these exposures become translated into ill health, in particular poor mental health, is unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, this application seeks to determine whether social adversity among AA residents of Detroit impacts glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network (GRRN) DNA methylation to lay the foundation for future risk of psychopathology. Exposure to stressful and traumatic events produces a physiologic cascade that includes epigenetic modification of genes whose activity contributes to psychopathological development. In particular, stress hormones (e.g. glucocorticoids) and genomic factors associated with them have been strongly linked to etiology of PTSD and other stress-related mental disorder. It remains unknown to what extent socially adverse exposures such as low SEP, discrimination, loneliness, and stressful life events impact DNA methylation in genes belonging to this pathway. We hypothesize that DNA methylation of GRRN genes in leukocytes is associated with prospective risk of PTSD and traumatic stress in Detroit-dwelling AAs, due to their role in the physiology of stress in both central and peripheral tissues. We further hypothesize that exposure to socioeconomic and psychosocial stressors impact DNA methylation variation in GRRN genes, laying the foundation for vulnerability to psychopathology, including post-traumatic stress symptom severity, depression symptom severity, and generalized anxiety symptom severity. This proposal brings together a strong investigative team with extensive expertise in social epidemiology, epigenetics, PTSD, and AA health. Our team will leverage data from a comprehensive, population based cohort study of mental health in AAs, the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS). Results will be replicated using data from two independent cohorts, the Grady Trauma Project and the Predictive Biomarkers of PTSD Project. In addition, in vitro cell culture experiments will be leveraged to test GRRN dysregulation in neuronal cell lines, and will test the functional significance of GRRN DNA methylation variation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will characterize genome wide patterns of leukocyte DNA methylation in African American participants in the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study, a population-based study of mental disorders among adult Detroit residents. Analysis will be targeted toward glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network genes and will test the effects of social adversity on DNA methylation levels in this gene network. The proposed research will also prospectively compare trauma-exposed participants who either did or did not develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in order to test whether social adversity impacts longitudinal patterns of DNA methylation in stress response genes.",Epigenomic Predictors of PTSD and Traumatic Stress in an African American Cohort,9387243,R01MD011728,"['adulthood ', ' Adult

"Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Title: Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer  Prostate cancer disproportionately affects African American (AA) men with higher incidence, mortality and aggressive disease. Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress such as neighborhood factors are widely regarded as the foremost driver of such health disparities however their association and translation to biological stress and mechanisms on pathogenesis are poorly understood. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) modulates stress response and has been suggested to mediate social stress induced effects on cellular physiology racial disparities in cancer outcomes. HPA-axis modulates cortisol levels controlling the glucocorticoid (GC) response following a social stress. In addition to cortisol, Leptin levels have been also demonstrated as effectors of stress response. Such stress hormones can modulate cancel cell signaling affecting pathogenesis and outcomes. MicroRNAs are epigenetic elements that are highly stable noncoding small 21-23nt gene- regulatory RNAs acting primarily by targeting 3’UTRs; their roles have been studied in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis as well as biomarkers of resistance and aggressive PCa. We have recently identified racially distinct differentially expressed miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids (serum and urine) as potential biomarker. Both Glucocorticoid and leptin signaling have been shown to affect the expression of miRNAs in human and laboratory models. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesize that social and neighborhood factors translate into continuous biological stress perturbing the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and leptin resulting in alteration of epigenetic machinery including expression of miRNAs. The proposal will analyze circulating microRNAs and stress hormone levels in African American (AA) prostate cancer patients of the Washington DC metro area with differential socioeconomic status and social stress. Next, we will study the interplay between stress hormones and selected microRNAs in modulating cancer hallmarks. Finally, we will study miRNA-targets-stress markers by identifying miRNA targets and pathways involved to mechanistically characterize selected miRNAs for pathways modulated during social stress. This study will bridge the gap between social factors and biological determinants by studying logical epigenetic mechanisms modulated by social stress and causing health disparities. Understanding these biological implications of social stress will significantly impact diagnosis, prognosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa in African Americans.

"Testing a Biopsychosocial Model of Minority Stress and Health for HIV-Positive Men Project Summary Gay and bisexual men (GBM) in the U.S. are burdened by a high and disproportionate rate of HIV infection and more than half of all HIV+ individuals are GBM. Improving viral load (VL) suppression is associated with a significant reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV. Moreover, research is needed to better understand the modifiable social and behavioral factors that influence their long-term health. Chronic experiences of sexual minority stressors (e.g., internalized homonegativity) have been shown to influence a variety of mental, behavioral, and physical health outcomes for GBM, including general stress (e.g., cortisol) and immune (e.g., cytokines) outcomes, as well as HIV-specific health outcomes (e.g., CD4 count) among HIV+ GBM. Chronic experiences of HIV-related stressors have also been shown to impact mental health and health behaviors for HIV+ GBM, though there is substantially less research on their role in the health of HIV+ GBM. Previous research, including our own, has shown that fluctuations in sexual minority and HIV-specific stressors (i.e., acute experiences of these stressors) are measurable and meaningfully associated with health outcomes. Both HIV infection and substance use are associated with declines in neurocognitive function and emerging evidence suggests that emotional processing may help explain the impact of psychological phenomena on health outcomes. To develop interventions that are robust and durable, research is needed that examines the unique and overlapping influence of sexual minority and HIV-related stressors on health outcomes for HIV+ GBM within a unified biopsychosocial model. Such a model should take into account both individual-level (i.e., chronic) and situational (i.e., acute) experiences of these stressors to examine their independent associations with health, and should consider whether emotional interference in cognitive processing might moderate these associations. Aim 1 of the study is to test a biopsychosocial model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress and health, examining direct and indirect effects of these stressors on each outcome. Aim 2 is to test the moderating role of emotional interference in cognitive processing on these associations. Finally, Aim 3 is to examine the extent of intraindividual variability over one year in sexual minority and HIV-related stressors, VL, CD4, and cytokines. Although not an aim, the study will culminate in the development of guidelines for future intervention development and we will gather participant feedback on these recommendations. To accomplish these aims, we will enroll 250 HIV+ GBM and follow them for 12 months. We will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over one year to test the impact of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on physiological stress (diurnal cortisol) and long-term immune outcomes (VL suppression, CD4 count, cytokines). This study will address novel questions about the relative role of sexual minority and HIV-related stress in the health of HIV+ GBM to guide the development of interventions to improve health and reduce HIV transmission, morbidity, and mortality among HIV+ GBM. Project Narrative Sexual minority stress is an established contributor to poorer behavioral, mental, and physical health for gay and bisexual men, though the role of HIV-related stress within these models has gone largely unexplored.

"Stress and the Genome: Testing the Impact of Social Effects on Gene Regulation Project Summary  The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and well being. Chronic social stress and reduced access to social support are strongly linked to major diseases of aging; as a result, social adversity is highly predictive of life expectancy itself. Recent evidence suggests that, while some of this relationship is explained by correlated factors such as smoking, obesity, and health care access, social stressors also have a direct impact on physiological function. Indeed, work in animal models has clearly demonstrated that the experience of social subordination alone can alter the function of the immune system, in part by altering gene regulation in immune cells.  The goal of the proposed research is to address a key outstanding question that arises from these findings: when, and for whom, are chronic social stress effects on immune function most important? To do so, it will take advantage of dominance rank in female rhesus macaques as a model for chronic social stressor exposure in humans. Rhesus macaque females are excellent models for human social stress because they naturally organize into dominance rank hierarchies in which low ranking individuals experience increased rates of harassment, reduced social affiliation, and physiological markers of rank-related stress. Importantly, dominance rank assignments, and thus an individual's exposure to social stressors, can be manipulated in this species by manipulating group membership. Such manipulations yield a powerful experimental model for investigating the consequences of socially induced stress—an approach that is directly translatable to humans, but that is practically and ethically impossible in humans themselves.  The proposed study will take advantage of this model to investigate how differential exposure to dominance rank-induced social stress causally influences gene expression in the immune system. Specifically, it will use an in vitro approach to efficiently screen for condition-specific social stress effects on gene expression levels across 30 physiologically relevant environmental conditions (e.g., pathogen exposure, steroid hormone signaling). It will complement the in vitro screen with an in vivo test of the gene regulatory and antibody response to influenza vaccination, a medical procedure in which variable responses are of particular concern as individuals age. Finally, it will test whether age, social behavior, and genotype can be used to predict interindividual variation in the strength of social stressor effects on immune regulation, and hence which individuals are most vulnerable. Together, the proposed analyses will provide much-needed insight into the factors that explain when and why individuals differ in their response to the same social stressors, as well as the potential consequences of these differences for medical treatment. The project's results will therefore have direct translational application to both identifying the most susceptible members of our aging population and suggesting tailored strategies for intervention. Project Narrative The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and wellbeing, with particularly strong predictive power for diseases of aging and mortality risk itself. This project uses a nonhuman primate model for human social stress, the rhesus macaque, to investigate the factors that explain interindividual variation in the impact of social stress on the genome, including the conditions under which these effects are most important. The results of this project will contribute to understanding how social stress influences disease susceptibility and how to identify those who are most vulnerable to its negative effects.",Stress and

"Childhood Family Instability, Adult Stress Reactivity, and Consequences for Health ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The family environments in which children are born and raised have a profound influence on their behavior, education, and health (Amato 2001; Cherlin 1999; McLanahan & Sandefur 2009). With the overlapping demographic and social trends of later age at marriage, greater acceptability of divorce and non-marital childbearing, and more cohabitation, the landscape of American families is diverse and dynamic. According to the recent Census, 29% of American children live with only one biological parent, and 3.5% reside with neither biological parent (Vespa et al. 2013). Such cross-sectional estimates, however, belie the true complexity and dynamism of family structures. Not only do children increasingly live in diverse family forms, but the childhood experience of family structure is dynamic, with children likely to live in a variety of families by the time they reach adulthood (Cavanagh & Huston 2006; Graefe & Lichter 1999; Heuveline et al. 2003).  Using nationally representative integrated demographic, social, contextual and biological data on children in the United States, the proposed study will trace the biological pathways through which childhood family instability influences adult health. The Investigator hypothesizes that family instability creates intense and chronic stress that will be evident in measures of adult stress reactivity and that have negative long-term health consequences. The project will evaluate the importance of instability during sensitive developmental stages of early childhood and adolescence, and investigate gender, race and ethnic differences in stress response processes. This project contributes to the field by examining the enduring health consequences of childhood exposure to dynamic family structures, a common life experience for today's children. Findings will further our understanding of the ways in which the social environment ""gets under the skin"" to influence physiological functioning and biological processes that have consequences for health. Knowledge gained from this project will help more effectively target child welfare policies to crucial developmental periods, and to better understand and reduce health disparities.  An interdisciplinary team of dedicated and highly skilled mentors developed a personalized training plan to support the Investigator in pursuit of her research and career goals. To accomplish the proposed research, the Investigator requires additional substantive and technical training in biology to be achieved through coursework, guided reading, seminars and workshops. The Investigator's professional development will be supported by strengthening her publication record, as well as her grant writing and communication skills. These activities will provide the Investigator with the training necessary to develop expertise in biosocial research and engage in productive interdisciplinary research at the intersection of social and biomedical sciences. The training will also facilitate the Investigator's transition to independent research, and enable her to attain her career goal of securing a faculty position at a leading research university.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The objective of this research project is to understand the biological pathways through which childhood family instability influences adult health, testing the role of stress reactivity. The project will evaluate the importance of instability during early childhood and adolescence, and investigate gender, race and ethnic differences in stress response. The results of this project will further our understanding of how the social environments in which we live are biologically embedded, affecting biological processes that often have no immediate outward health consequences but do biological damage for years before disease is manifest.            ","Childhood Family Instability, Adult Stress Reactivity, and Consequences for Health",9348399,F32HD084117,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adolescence ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' Communication ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Divorced state ', ' Divorce ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Life Experience ', ' Literature ', ' Marriage ', ' Marriage Ages ', ' age at marriage ', ' Mentors ', ' Mothers ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Parents ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Residential Mobility ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' career ', ' Family Study ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Living Arrangement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' The Sun ', ' sun ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' fetal ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' skills ', ' family structure ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' child bearing ', ' childbearing ', ' bearing children ', ' bear children ', ' Biosocial ', ' family influence ', ' biological research ', ' public health relevance ', ' early adolescence ', ' Secure ', ' stress reactivity ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F32,2017,55057,0.09775782086427671
"Molecular Epidemiology of Oxidative Stress and Related Cancers in Black Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxidative stress is defined as an ""imbalance in pro-oxidants and antioxidants with associated disruption of redox circuitry and macromolecular damage"". Chronic oxidative stress is believed to increase the risk of many cancers such as breast and colorectal cancers. Despite being at increased risk of developing and dying from oxidative-stress related cancers, African-Americans are under-represented in population-based studies of oxidative stress and cancer. This is especially true for biomarker-based and nutritional epidemiology studies of oxidative stress. This career development award is designed to provide training and research experience to Dr. Dash to support his goal of becoming an independent researcher investigating the molecular epidemiology of cancers among minorities including cancer disparities. Proposed training plans include mentorship and coursework in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and exploratory data analysis, filling gaps in research training related to studies among minorities and health disparity studies, and research considerations in recruitment and bio specimen collection from minorities in epidemiologic research. The research component of the proposal aims to address the research gaps mentioned above by (1) characterizing the systemic oxidative stress burden via measurement of a panel of known biomarkers of oxidative stress using proteomics and metabolomics technologies; (2) identifying dietary patterns associated with oxidative stress; and (3) investigating the association of these dietary patterns with risk of breast and colorectal cancers among African- American women. The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involves measurement of a panel of 6 oxidative stress biomarkers using proteomic and metabolomic approaches and describing the oxidative stress burden among African-American women without cancer. Dietary patterns related to the biomarkers of oxidative stress will also be identified usin dietary intake data self-reported by participants on food frequency questionnaires. Phase 2 of the study involves investigating the association of the oxidative stress-related dietary patterns developed in Phase 1 with breast and colon cancer risk in a large, nationally-representative, cohort study of Black women. Results from the study will support larger and more definitive studies on oxidative stress and cancer among African-American women. The proposed research complements the training and mentorship plans in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and minority health research. With this award Dr. Chiranjeev Dash will combine his previous training in epidemiology with advanced training in metabolomics/proteomics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, and gain experience in conduct of minority health research to establish an independent research career focusing on translational research on the molecular epidemiology of oxidative stress in cancer causation and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses a priority area for the National Cancer Institute, minority health research and research to reduce cancer health disparities. This study focuses on studying the molecular epidemiology of oxidative stress and cancer among African-American women, an underserved minority group who have been under-represented in biomarker-based oxidative stress and cancer research. The study will provide data on the role of dietary patterns in oxidative stress and investigate whether oxidative stress-associated dietary patterns are associated with breast and colon cancer risk among African- American women.",Molecular Epidemiology of Oxidative Stress and Related Cancers in Black Women,9270523,K07CA197112,"['anti-oxidant ', ' Antioxidants ', ' Award ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' Colo-rectal Neoplasms ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' L-Cysteine ', ' Half-Cystine ', ' Cysteine ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Testing a Biopsychosocial Model of Minority Stress and Health for HIV-Positive Men Project Summary Gay and bisexual men (GBM) in the U.S. are burdened by a high and disproportionate rate of HIV infection and more than half of all HIV+ individuals are GBM. Improving viral load (VL) suppression is associated with a significant reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV. Moreover, research is needed to better understand the modifiable social and behavioral factors that influence their long-term health. Chronic experiences of sexual minority stressors (e.g., internalized homonegativity) have been shown to influence a variety of mental, behavioral, and physical health outcomes for GBM, including general stress (e.g., cortisol) and immune (e.g., cytokines) outcomes, as well as HIV-specific health outcomes (e.g., CD4 count) among HIV+ GBM. Chronic experiences of HIV-related stressors have also been shown to impact mental health and health behaviors for HIV+ GBM, though there is substantially less research on their role in the health of HIV+ GBM. Previous research, including our own, has shown that fluctuations in sexual minority and HIV-specific stressors (i.e., acute experiences of these stressors) are measurable and meaningfully associated with health outcomes. Both HIV infection and substance use are associated with declines in neurocognitive function and emerging evidence suggests that emotional processing may help explain the impact of psychological phenomena on health outcomes. To develop interventions that are robust and durable, research is needed that examines the unique and overlapping influence of sexual minority and HIV-related stressors on health outcomes for HIV+ GBM within a unified biopsychosocial model. Such a model should take into account both individual-level (i.e., chronic) and situational (i.e., acute) experiences of these stressors to examine their independent associations with health, and should consider whether emotional interference in cognitive processing might moderate these associations. Aim 1 of the study is to test a biopsychosocial model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress and health, examining direct and indirect effects of these stressors on each outcome. Aim 2 is to test the moderating role of emotional interference in cognitive processing on these associations. Finally, Aim 3 is to examine the extent of intraindividual variability over one year in sexual minority and HIV-related stressors, VL, CD4, and cytokines. Although not an aim, the study will culminate in the development of guidelines for future intervention development and we will gather participant feedback on these recommendations. To accomplish these aims, we will enroll 250 HIV+ GBM and follow them for 12 months. We will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over one year to test the impact of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on physiological stress (diurnal cortisol) and long-term immune outcomes (VL suppression, CD4 count, cytokines). This study will address novel questions about the relative role of sexual minority and HIV-related stress in the health of HIV+ GBM to guide the development of interventions to improve health and reduce HIV transmission, morbidity, and mortality among HIV+ GBM. Project Narrative Sexual minority stress is an established contributor to poorer behavioral, mental, and physical health for gay and bisexual men, though the role of HIV-related stress within these models has gone largely unexplored.

"Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health problems are proportionately affect racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as populations that face chronic economic hardship (Evans, Wolf & Adler, 2012). There is clear evidence that (1) the processes that lay the groundwork for mental health disparities is laid during childhood (e.g., Chen & Miller, 2012) and (2) that damage to and dysregulation of the physiologic stress response is a powerful mechanism of the effects of chronic stress such as that associated with poverty on psychopathology (e.g., Evans & Kim, 2012). To contribute solutions to mental health disparities, we need interventions capable of affecting the systems that confer the risk. Since the psychobiologic stress response system (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis; HPA) is a central mechanism linking health disparities to chronic stress, the stress response is a critical system to target. Improving children's ability to cope with stress and regulate their reactivity ha the potential to break the cycle of damage, especially if the coping strategies and regulatory processes that we target have effects at the physiologic level. Preliminary evidence from the PIs research lab has emerged showing that different types of coping are evident at the level of the HPA-it is, therefore, time to evaluate whether a coping intervention designed for children facing chronic stress will both (a) improve children's ability to use primary and secondary control coping, and (b) have sustained effects at the physiologic level. We have developed just such an intervention, which builds on these exciting new findings and is designed to address core underlying mechanisms of risk and repair in the highly stressful context of poor, urban youths' lives.  Preadolescence is a crucial time during which children's ability to recognize stress and it causes matures, and repertoires for coping with stress grow in both size and complexity. In addition, preadolescence is a time of increased brain changes and growth in key self-regulatory organs and systems. Preadolescents are, therefore, at a ripe stage to benefit from coping-based prevention and the plasticity of this developmental period suggests that such changes have the potential to be long-lasting. Our new prevention program is designed to prevent the onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in preadolescent children facing chronic stress. Two mechanisms of action are targeted in this project. First, the project seeks to demonstrate that children facing chronic stress stemming from poverty, discrimination, and violence exposure can acquire and utilize new ways of coping that are adaptive in a wide variety of circumstances. Second, the project will examine the extent to which improved coping resulting from the intervention engages the physiologic intermediate mechanism of the HPA. Finally, the project aims to link changes in coping and the HPA to changes in internalizing symptoms that would signal prevention of the emergence of new or worsening of existing symptoms. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system that leads to psychopathology can offer new directions for combatting health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and socioeconomic disparities in physical and mental health problems are large, persistent, and severe; begin during childhood; and stem from in part damage to physiologic stress response systems caused by chronic stress. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system may offer new directions for combatting health disparities. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a new prevention program designed to teach preadolescent children effective ways for coping with chronic stress that will have direct effects on their physiologic stress response systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and ultimately prevent onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms and disorders.",Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress,9763112,R33MH107631,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Wolves ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' preadolescence ', ' preteen ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenic ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' R21/R33 Program ', ' R21/R33 Mechanism ', ' Phased Innovation Awards ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' psychobiological ', ' psychobiologic ', ' stem ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' intervention effect ', ' coping mechanism ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' violence victimization ', ' racial minority ', ' psychological symptom ', ' stress symptom ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIMH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R33,2018,137630,0.18156684209296528
"Epigenetic Mediation of Adverse Social Context on Stress Response, Socioemotional Development, and Health in a Population-based Study of Minority and Low SES Children and Adolescents Project Abstract Pronounced disparities exist by race, ethnicity, and SES in children and adolescents across a range of health conditions, and many adult health disparities can be traced to childhood social contextual inequalities. Epigenetics—modifications to the genome that are not changes in nucleotide sequence—holds great promise as potential indicators of contextual effects and health condition, potentially uncovering health disparities long before they are normally observable. Building on an existing representative study of children, this proposal will directly respond to PAR-16-355 by: 1) assembling epigenome-wide data on 2,000 children at two points in time, 2) describing methylation patterns in 3 race/ethnic groups and across SES levels, and 3) explicating epigenetic associations with social adversity, biological processes, and socioemotional development. The overarching hypothesis is that DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, DHEA levels) and stress responsive behaviors (behavioral problems, risk taking, and resilience). We further hypothesize both differential exposure and differential response to adversity by race/ethnicity and SES explains some of the disparity in stress response and socioemotional development—thereby requiring formal comparisons of race/ethnicity and SES in the same study. To conduct this research we utilize the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS): a 20-city nationally and city representative sample of 4898 children born in 1998- 2000. FFCW provides a uniquely high prevalence of non-Hispanic Black (47%), Hispanic (27%), and impoverished families, making the data particularly useful for studying race/ethnic and SES differences. Families were interviewed at birth and at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15—with biological data collected at ages 9 and 15. The expected results will be to provide estimates of: 1) population-based epigenome-wide DNA methylation measures for 3 race/ethnic groups (Hispanic n=600, African ancestry n=980, European ancestry n=420) in childhood and adolescence, 2) associations of social adversity across development (from in utero to age 15) with DNA methylation, 3) associations between DNA methylation and biological measures of stress response (i.e. telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, and DHEA levels), 4) associations between development of stress response behaviors and methylation profiles, and 5) comparisons of all these relationships in 3 race/ethnic groups and across a wide range of SES. Project Narrative This proposal examines if DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, DHEA levels) and stress responsive behaviors (behavioral problems, risk taking, and resilience).","Epigenetic Mediation of Adverse Social Context on Stress Response, Socioemotional Development, and Health in a Population-based Study of Minority and Low SES Children

"Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender people are a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. They express their gender-variant identity in various ways and through a multitude of self- labels, both within and outside of binary conceptualizations of sex/gender as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine. While public awareness of this diversity has grown, our understanding of transgender people's experience is limited by a lack of systematic research on their identity development. Health inequities documented among the U.S. transgender population include depression (44%), suicidal ideation (54%) and attempts (31%), anxiety (33%), smoking (36%), and HIV infection (12% based on self- report; 28% on testing). Social stigma attached to gender nonconformity has been proposed as a major contributing factor to these health inequities. Previous research found that the vast majority of transgender individuals experienced discrimination. Much of the data, however, is limited by the use of small convenience samples of transgender women with a history of sex work, recruited from AIDS and social service agencies. The goal of this study is to move beyond these limitations by using purposive, venue-based sampling to recruit a broad, diverse sample of transgender people in 3 U.S. cities--New York, San Francisco, and Atlanta-and enroll them into a mixed-method longitudinal study to test an adaptation of the minority stress model, investigating vulnerability, risk and resilience in the context of identity development. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the process of transgender identity development based on qualitative lifeline interviews with a sample of 90 transgender individuals ages 16 and older, and identify periods of acute vulnerability and characteristics of resilience; (2) Informed by findings from Aim 1, to refine a model combining identity development, minority stress, and resilience, and to develop/adapt measures to assess the model's key constructs; (3) To test the model of resilience in a cohort of transgender individuals (N = 480) stratified by city, gender, and age, and follow them over time (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow up interviews); and (4) To triangulate qualitative and quantitative data on identity development and minority stress processes in order to inform the future development and testing of intervention strategies aimed at fostering resilience and reducing stigma and discrimination. By achieving these aims, this study will make a significant advance in scientific knowledge about gender identity development, minority stress processes (enacted stigma, felts stigma, concealment, shame and their impact on health and psychosocial adjustment), minority coping (on an individual as well as community level), and the development of resilience over time. The study is innovative in its focus on an understudied minority population, the application of the lifeline interview method to this population, and the adaptation and testing of the minority stress model within the context of transgender identity development. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Research to date has found inequities in mental health, substance use, HIV infection, and other health concerns among gender nonconforming people in the United States. This study takes a longitudinal, mixed- method approach to uncover the mechanism of how stigma and minority stress affect health and psychosocial development among this population, identifying periods of acute vulnerability and corresponding resilience. Findings will inform the development of future intervention strategies aimed at reducing stigma and promoting the health and wellbeing of this and other vulnerable populations.","Identity Development, Risk, and Resilience among Gender Diverse Populations",9534150,R01HD079603,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Homosexuals ', ' Interview ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' New York City ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Shame ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Work ', ' Social Service ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Typology ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' base ', ' Label ', ' Acute ', ' incarceration ', ' incarcerated ', ' Imprisonment ', ' Series ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Domestic Violence ', ' Age of Onset ', ' Feminine ', ' Masculine ', ' Distress ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' unhoused ', ' homeless ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Feeling suicidal ', ' thoughts about suicide ', ' suicide ideation ', ' suicidal thinking ', ' suicidal ideation ', ' Suicidal thoughts ', ' transgender ', ' trans* ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' psychosocial development ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', "" man's "", ' man ', ' public health relevance ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' transwomen ', ' transwoman ', ' trans-women ', ' transgender women ', ' transmen ', ' transman ', ' trans-men ', ' transgender men ', ' non-gender conforming ', ' gender non-conforming ', ' gender nonconforming ', ' Hormone use ', ' gender variance ', ' gender variant ', ' peer support ', ' family support ', ' gender diversity ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NICHD,NEW YORK STATE PSYCHIATRIC INSTITUTE,R01,2018,556709,0.06362007634242797
"A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this study is to determine how different trajectories of minority stress experienced throughout adolescence may predict behavioral health outcomes for SMA. Relying on methods established and tested in our preliminary work, we will recruit a national sample of diverse SMA (e.g., race and ethnicity, gender, urban vs. rural; N = 1,500) through both social media and respondent-driven sampling strategies in the first year of the project. We will follow participants for three years, incorporating the fundamental tenets of developmental psychopathology, which suggest that examining risk and protective factors for adolescents necessitates longitudinal exploration across critical stages of development. Guiding the proposal are three specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the individual and group trajectories of minority stress over time by following a national sample of SMA (N = 1,500) for 3 years. WH1: There will be differences in minority stress across adolescent development. Aim 2: Determine whether trajectories of minority stress are associated with differences in behavioral health outcomes over time. WH2.1: Trajectories of minority stress and behavioral health outcomes will be associated over time. WH2.2: Reporting higher levels of minority stress in early adolescence will be associated with poorer behavioral health outcomes in later adolescence. Aim 3: Determine whether the association between minority stress and behavioral health over time is different based on sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., urbanicity, gender, race and ethnicity). WH3: There will be significant differences in outcome trajectories by demographic subgroup. WH4: Trajectories of minority stress will be inversely associated with protective factors over time and will differ by demographic subgroup. To test our hypotheses, we propose cutting-edge longitudinal quantitative methodology including latent growth-curve modeling, which are rarely used to examine longitudinal risk among SMAs. The proposed research will be the first to determine how minority stress may influence health across adolescence, and this information can be used directly to inform clinical assessment and the development of targeted behavioral health interventions for this high-need population. Project Narrative Sexual minority adolescents (SMA; adolescents who report a same-sex sexual orientation) are at much higher risk for behavioral health concerns than their heterosexual peers, yet little is known about how different patterns of gay-related stress over time impacts mental/behavioral health outcomes. The proposed research is to examine the individual and group trajectories of sexual minority adolescents (ages 14 to 17 at baseline) and examine how differences in these trajectories predict behavioral health outcomes. The resulting knowledge can be used to inform clinical assessment and the development of effective targeted behavioral health interventions to reduce the behavioral health disparities found in this high need population.",A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents,9572431,R01MD012252,"['Academy ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Marshal ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' life history ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' early adolescence ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' lesbian, gay, bisexual ', ' Same-sex ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2018,700559,0.07466901078672034
"Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The growing racial disparity in obesity has reached a critical juncture, particularly among black and white females. Obesity is now being perpetuated across generations. While there is uncertainty about how best to prevent obesity and the related racial disparities, converging lines of evidence support the influence of stress on obesity. We hypothesize that income and race are associated with higher levels of both objective and perceived stress, which in turn are associated with higher rates of dysregulated eating, a behavior posited to result in an increased rate of obesity. Finally, we propose that stress has a direct effect on the level of obesity in the offspring. We propose to model these relationships longitudinally using the National Growth and Healthy Study (NGHS) that enrolled equal numbers of black and white girls and that contains extensive measures of life stress, nonhomeostatic eating, household demographic and socioeconomic indicators and cardiometabolic risk factors for black and white girls initially sampled at age 10 and interviewed annually until age 20. We will extend these data, adding a new wave of data collection for the women who are now 36 and their children. We will interview participants regarding their current levels of stress, household food insecurity, dysregulated eating behaviors such as dietary restraint and overeating, and collect data on dietary intake and physical activity. We will collect measured weight and central adiposity and clinical measures of metabolic syndrome on both the women and their children. Building on the rich source of longitudinal data that NGHS provides, we will model relationships between these factors and weight status from early childhood to adulthood among these women and their children in order to examine the effects of cumulative stress, eating behaviors and obesity on obesity in the next generation. The study aims to test the hypotheses that: 1) stress and dysregulated eating results in an increased rate of obesity, exacerbated by food insecurity; 2) maternal stress and dysregulated eating have a direct effect on the level of obesity and markers of metabolic syndrome in offspring; and, 3) race and income are associated with higher levels of stress and dysregulated eating in women. Our preliminary data suggests that stress leads to excessive weight gain ten years later in the NGHS cohort. We will identify predictors of weight gain trajectories from childhood to adulthood. These constructs have the potential to lead to promising interventions coupled with traditional diet and physical activity components that will help girls and women throughout the life course. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Growing black/white disparities and the perpetuation of obesity across generations has reached a critical juncture, particularly among girls and women. The current proposal seeks to add a new wave of data collection to survey participants regarding current stress factors, household food insecurity, and non-homeostatic eating such as restrained and drive to overeat and evaluate the relationships between these factors and weight gain trajectories in a longitudinal cohort of girls followed from age 10 to 36 years. We believe that this approach will identify modifiable stress-based factors that can be incorporated into intervention trials leading to sustained changes in children's and women's weight trajectories.","Race, stress and dysregulated eating: Maternal to child transmission of obesity",9524566,R01HD073568,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' Arousal ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Data Collection ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Emotions ', ' Epidemic ', ' Female ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hyperphagia ', ' polyphagia ', ' Overeating ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Mothers ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Weight Gain ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight ', ' Weights and Measures ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' base ', ' Body Measures ', ' Body measure procedure ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' restraint ', ' Body fat ', ' Life ', ' Calories ', ' Source ', ' waist circumference ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' Nutrient ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Dietary intake ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' next generation ', ' social disparities ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' Coupled ', ' sixteen years of age ', ' sixteen year old ', ' age 16 years ', ' 16 years of age ', ' 16 year old ', ' public health relevance ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' clinically useful biomarkers ', ' clinical biomarkers ', ' black/white disparity ', ' maternal adiposity ', ' maternal obesity ', ' maternal weight ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' offspring obesity ', ' obesity development ', ' adults with obesity ', ' adult adiposity ', ' adult obesity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,R01,2018,391019,0.055760971475478135
"Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Recent research suggests that chronic early life stress may pose serious threats to child well-being and set individuals on pathways towards increased physical and mental health problems in adulthood. In addition to being a key health input across the life course, chronic stress is produced through individuals' responses to their environments and thus reflects the interaction of social contexts with biological processes. Improving population health and reducing health disparities necessitates that we understand these socio-biological interactions, particularly during the early stages of the life course when physiological changes may become biologically embedded.  This K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award in Population Research application addresses this critical research need by proposing a training plan and research agenda that will build on my sociology, family demography and child health background to become an independent, innovative researcher in the area of social contexts, chronic stress and health during childhood. To achieve this goal, I propose formal training and mentoring in the biology of stress, collection and analysi of stress biomarkers, child development, and multilevel modeling. My highly-qualified team of mentors and advisory committee members come from the fields of sociology, demography, epidemiology, nursing, and psychology, reflecting the need for a multi- disciplinary approach in conducting research that integrates biological and social processes.  I will use my training and mentoring in these new areas to answer important research questions about how family contexts are associated with chronic stress in children, and the implications of chronic stress for child health and health disparities in the U.S. In the past four decades, there have been large and pervasive shifts in children's family contexts towards unmarried and unstable parental unions, which are often accompanied by socioeconomic disadvantage. Research suggests that these contexts contribute to child health and development disadvantages and the reproduction of social inequalities across generations. However, there has been little attention to assessing chronic stress as a pathway through which family contexts affect child health.  The expected outcome of this project is paradigm-shifting research that incorporates biological mechanisms into our conceptualization and empirical tests of family context effects on child well-being. Importantly, the conclusions will go beyond a comparison of married vs. unmarried mother families to consider diverse family structures and processes as they impact child stress and health. Using multilevel and population-based data will advance our understanding of the influence of larger social contexts (i.e., neighborhoods and social status) on these processes and will provide generalizable results. These are critical next steps in child health, family demography, and stress research that will set the stage for future research and policy development aimed at reducing chronic stress and health disparities in children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Children's family environments have changed dramatically over the past 40 years in the U.S., with potentially important implications for their stress and health. Adverse or unstable family contexts may produce chronic stress in children due to the need for predictability in family relationships and adequate resources (of all types) for healthy child development. Chronic stress, in turn, may pose threats to children's physical, emotional and cognitive development. Understanding the extent to which increasingly diverse and unstable family environments are associated with chronic stress in children, and delineating pathways linking family structure, stress and child outcomes, are important next steps in family demography and child health research. This research will further our understanding of the role of family structure and instability as social determinants of child stress, and biological mechanisms through which family contexts contribute to the reproduction of health and social inequalities.","Family Contexts, Physiological Stress and Health in Children",9502186,K01HD077063,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Welfare ', ' child wellbeing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Demography ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Physiology ', ' Psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Reproduction ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Siblings ', ' Social Conditions ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Interaction ', ' Social Policies ', ' Sociology ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Unmarried Mother ', ' single motherhood ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Family Demographies ', ' Mediating ', ' Unmarried ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Developments ', ' Inequality ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Shapes ', ' grandparent ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' family structure ', ' social inequality ', ' Social status ', ' social standing ', ' social position ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Emotional ', ' Committee Members ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiology Nursing ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' Family Process ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' family influence ', ' multidisciplinary approach ', ' interdisciplinary approach ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' health inequalities ', ' population health ', ' cognitive development ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' Child Health ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' early life stress ', ' ']",NICHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,128450,0.20736118272593346
"Neurophysiological mechanisms of Stress Coping Behaviors Abstract There are wide variations in behavioral responses to social stress. Some individuals successfully employ coping strategies in response to stress, and become resilient. In others, social stress can precipitate psychiatric dysfunction, such as depression and anxiety. While coping mechanisms are known to be crucial for the maintenance of healthy mental functioning and a proper, successful coping strategy decreases the impact of stress and protects from long-term pathological states, there is less known about the neurophysiological basis of how this occurs. Importantly, it is clinically evident that vulnerability to stress-induced neuropsychiatric diseases is highly individual and may in part depend on these coping style. Human studies suggest that passive coping during stressful life events is associated with the development of stress-induced depression, whereas proactive coping is correlated with resiliency. Interestingly, males and females demonstrate different social stress coping strategies, suggesting potentially non-overlapping neural circuitry adaptations occurring in response to stress. Despite these clear gender differences and the increased incidence of major depression in females, translational work in this field has focused primarily on males. Identifying the neurobiological gender differences in stress coping responses may inform greatly needed mechanistically driven therapeutics for depression. The animal models proposed in this award will provide crucial mechanistic and neural circuit understanding of stress coping strategies influence on the stress response. Vulnerability to stress-induced diseases is highly individual and may in part depend on variable coping styles. Following repeated stress, there is increased arousal, expectancy and anxiety. It is these functions that facilitate coping at the circuit level, therefore our work focuses on those related brain regions. Recent studies have revealed the critical and opposing roles of the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Furthermore, the BNST projects to and regulates the firing of dopaminergic cells via GABAergic interneurons within the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region which has been shown to be linked to stress-related depressive phenotype. Thus the VTA projecting BNST neurons are uniquely positioned to receive stress axis information and integrate it into reward/motivation circuitry. The two specific aims outlined this proposal will fully characterize these behavioral models and identify neurophysiological changes that occur within the BNST-VTA pathway Research leading towards further understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of active stress coping strategies, and how they can enhance resistance to stress induced depression may provide novel pharmacological targets to enhance coping skills and reverse depressive symptoms. In summary, the research proposed in this Support of Competitive Research Pilot Project Award (SC2) is critical for the development of my independent research path. This mechanism will provide the financial, and mentorship support for the next steps in my career at Hunter College at the City University of New York.   Relevance statement Stress induced depression has a tremendous negative impact on the health of the individual and society. The research generated in this proposal will investigate a discrete neural circuit that mediates differential responses to stress, dependent on sex and coping strategy. These data will shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the differences in stress response in males and females and may lead to the development of potential targeted therapeutics to treat depression.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of Stress Coping Behaviors,9459384,SC2GM122646,"['Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cities ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Glutamates ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Interneurons ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Motivation ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurons ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' New York ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' avoidance behavior ', ' career ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Dopaminergic Cell ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' reward circuitry ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' resilience ', ' Expectancy ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' translational study ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' neural adaptation ', ' neuroadaptation ', ' coping mechanism ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' targeted treatment ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' mental function ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender difference ', ' gender disparity ', ' ']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,SC2,2018,156000,0.09509726471830685
"Molecular Epidemiology of Oxidative Stress and Related Cancers in Black Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxidative stress is defined as an ""imbalance in pro-oxidants and antioxidants with associated disruption of redox circuitry and macromolecular damage"". Chronic oxidative stress is believed to increase the risk of many cancers such as breast and colorectal cancers. Despite being at increased risk of developing and dying from oxidative-stress related cancers, African-Americans are under-represented in population-based studies of oxidative stress and cancer. This is especially true for biomarker-based and nutritional epidemiology studies of oxidative stress. This career development award is designed to provide training and research experience to Dr. Dash to support his goal of becoming an independent researcher investigating the molecular epidemiology of cancers among minorities including cancer disparities. Proposed training plans include mentorship and coursework in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and exploratory data analysis, filling gaps in research training related to studies among minorities and health disparity studies, and research considerations in recruitment and bio specimen collection from minorities in epidemiologic research. The research component of the proposal aims to address the research gaps mentioned above by (1) characterizing the systemic oxidative stress burden via measurement of a panel of known biomarkers of oxidative stress using proteomics and metabolomics technologies; (2) identifying dietary patterns associated with oxidative stress; and (3) investigating the association of these dietary patterns with risk of breast and colorectal cancers among African- American women. The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involves measurement of a panel of 6 oxidative stress biomarkers using proteomic and metabolomic approaches and describing the oxidative stress burden among African-American women without cancer. Dietary patterns related to the biomarkers of oxidative stress will also be identified usin dietary intake data self-reported by participants on food frequency questionnaires. Phase 2 of the study involves investigating the association of the oxidative stress-related dietary patterns developed in Phase 1 with breast and colon cancer risk in a large, nationally-representative, cohort study of Black women. Results from the study will support larger and more definitive studies on oxidative stress and cancer among African-American women. The proposed research complements the training and mentorship plans in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and minority health research. With this award Dr. Chiranjeev Dash will combine his previous training in epidemiology with advanced training in metabolomics/proteomics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, and gain experience in conduct of minority health research to establish an independent research career focusing on translational research on the molecular epidemiology of oxidative stress in cancer causation and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses a priority area for the National Cancer Institute, minority health research and research to reduce cancer health disparities. This study focuses on studying the molecular epidemiology of oxidative stress and cancer among African-American women, an underserved minority group who have been under-represented in biomarker-based oxidative stress and cancer research. The study will provide data on the role of dietary patterns in oxidative stress and investigate whether oxidative stress-associated dietary patterns are associated with breast and colon cancer risk among African- American women.",Molecular Epidemiology of Oxidative Stress and Related Cancers in Black Women,9478559,K07CA197112,"['Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Award ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' Colo-rectal Neoplasms ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cysteine ', ' L-Cysteine ', ' Half-Cystine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' District of Columbia ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Identity Stress and Health in Three Cohorts of LGB individuals DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth and adults suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Minority stress theory suggests that because of prejudice and stigma in the social environment, LGB people experience excess stress that leads to poor health outcomes and health disparities. Because of its focus on the social environment, minority stress theory leads us to predict that the character of stress processes affecting LGBs shift along with improvement in the social environment. Similarly shifting are notions of LGB identity, connection with the community, and the types of social and health services LGB people seek. If we are to achieve the U.S. Public Health Services' goal of reducing health disparities related to sexual orientation, we need to understand the impact of changes in identity and minority stress on LGB health and, using this knowledge, inform public health interventions across the lifespan. To gain this knowledge, we propose a longitudinal study using a probability sample of diverse LGBs representative of LGBs in the U.S. population. We seek to compare 3 cohorts of LGB individuals-aged 18 - 25, 34 - 42, and 48 - 55 years old-who are distinct in that they were exposed to significantly different social environments when they came of age. We are interested in ways that identity and minority stress predict health across the cohorts. We will use a mixed method design that allows us to gain knowledge from both qualitative and survey data. We use an innovative 2-stage procedure to recruit a sample of 676 LGB individuals representative of U.S. Black, Latino, and White LGB populations. We assess respondents baseline and annually for 3 years thereafter. In a qualitative study, we use a narrative life history to assess a diverse group of Black, Latino, White, and Asian LGB individuals in urban and rural regions of New York, California, and Arizona. We hypothesize that: 1. Despite readily acknowledging an LGB identity and coming out at a younger age than did older cohorts, the younger cohorts differ from older cohorts in that their LGB identity is less central, they are less strongly identified with the LGB community, and have different meanings of sexual orientation and identity. 2. Compared with older, the younger cohort experience less minority stress related to their own acceptance of a gay identity and coming out, but more external stress, including prejudice-related stressful life events, antigay violence, and everyday forms of discrimination. 3. Members of younger LGB cohorts utilize fewer LGB-identified social and health services than do members of older LGB cohorts. 4. In structural equations, the minority stress model functions equally well in predicting health outcomes in the younger and older cohorts, but patterns of stress, resilience, and health outcomes differ among the cohorts in accordance with findings in Aims 1 and 2. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth continue to suffer disparities in health outcomes compared with their heterosexual peers. Social changes have significantly altered the developmental trajectories of today's LGB youth, requiring that we reexamine our knowledge of stress and health in this population.

"Epigenetic Mediation of Adverse Social Context on Stress Response, Socioemotional Development, and Health in a Population-based Study of Minority and Low SES Children and Adolescents Project Abstract Pronounced disparities exist by race, ethnicity, and SES in children and adolescents across a range of health conditions, and many adult health disparities can be traced to childhood social contextual inequalities. Epigenetics—modifications to the genome that are not changes in nucleotide sequence—holds great promise as potential indicators of contextual effects and health condition, potentially uncovering health disparities long before they are normally observable. Building on an existing representative study of children, this proposal will directly respond to PAR-16-355 by: 1) assembling epigenome-wide data on 2,000 children at two points in time, 2) describing methylation patterns in 3 race/ethnic groups and across SES levels, and 3) explicating epigenetic associations with social adversity, biological processes, and socioemotional development. The overarching hypothesis is that DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, DHEA levels) and stress responsive behaviors (behavioral problems, risk taking, and resilience). We further hypothesize both differential exposure and differential response to adversity by race/ethnicity and SES explains some of the disparity in stress response and socioemotional development—thereby requiring formal comparisons of race/ethnicity and SES in the same study. To conduct this research we utilize the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS): a 20-city nationally and city representative sample of 4898 children born in 1998- 2000. FFCW provides a uniquely high prevalence of non-Hispanic Black (47%), Hispanic (27%), and impoverished families, making the data particularly useful for studying race/ethnic and SES differences. Families were interviewed at birth and at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15—with biological data collected at ages 9 and 15. The expected results will be to provide estimates of: 1) population-based epigenome-wide DNA methylation measures for 3 race/ethnic groups (Hispanic n=600, African ancestry n=980, European ancestry n=420) in childhood and adolescence, 2) associations of social adversity across development (from in utero to age 15) with DNA methylation, 3) associations between DNA methylation and biological measures of stress response (i.e. telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, and DHEA levels), 4) associations between development of stress response behaviors and methylation profiles, and 5) comparisons of all these relationships in 3 race/ethnic groups and across a wide range of SES.  Project Narrative This proposal examines if DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, DHEA levels) and stress responsive behaviors (behavioral problems, risk taking, and resilience). ","Epigenetic Mediation of Adverse Social Context on Stress Response,

"Maternal Stress and Preterm Birth:  Role of Genome and Epigenome Project Summary/Abstract Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the US and the globe, and can lead to a cascade of health problems later in life. Despite decades of research, our ability to predict and prevent PTB remains poor. Maternal stress preconception and during pregnancy is emerging as an important modifiable risk factor of PTB, but previous studies have yielded inconsistent findings. While methodological variations in study designs and stress measurements across studies may have contributed to these inconsistencies, another possibility, the individual difference in susceptibility to stress, has received increasing attention but has not yet been well studied. Research by others and us suggests that several factors are at play: gene × environment interactions may play an important role in PTB, maternal stress may lead to epigenetic changes, and maternal epigenetic alterations are associated with PTB; yet these data remain fragmented. This proposed study offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate these factors and fill in the aforementioned gaps to connect the dots. We propose to utilize the existing databases of the Boston Birth Cohort, including maternal stress data, genome-wide genotype data, epigenome-wide DNA methylation data as well as extensive covariables from 2,000 African American mothers (~800 PTBs). We aim to address the following novel aims: Aim 1. To study the interactions of maternal stress and maternal genome on PTB risk. We hypothesize that high levels of maternal stress (including self-reported psychosocial stress and physician-diagnosed emotional disorders preconception and during pregnancy) are associated with an increased risk of PTB, and that the associations between maternal stress and PTB are modified by maternal genotypes. Aim 2. To study the role of maternal epigenome in mediating maternal gene × stress interactions on PTB risk. We hypothesize that maternal DNA methylation (DNAm) can mediate the associations between maternal stress and PTB risk; as well as the associations between maternal gene × stress interactions and PTB risk, as identified in Aim 1. To address these aims, we will employ both a hypothesis-driven and a genome-wide approach, and will replicate our findings in independent multi-ethnic samples. While PTB will be the primary outcome, we will also explore PTB subtypes and related traits as the secondary outcomes. This proposed study would be the first to explore the complex interplay of maternal stress, genome, and epigenome on PTB in a high-risk US minority population. It will lay the groundwork to better understand the role of stress in PTB, especially individual susceptibility to stress and underlying epigenetic mechanisms. Findings from this study will be directly relevant to high risk urban, low income, African American populations, and may help to inform novel interventions to reduce the persistent and striking Black- White PTB disparity. Project Narrative / Relevance Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the US and the globe and can lead to a cascade of health problems later in life; however, our ability to predict and prevent preterm birth remains poor. By utilizing existing databases of a well-established U.S. birth cohort, this proposal will investigate maternal stress preconception and during pregnancy, the maternal genome and their interactions in relation to preterm birth, and examine how these relationships are mediated by maternal epigenetic changes. Findings from this study will lay the groundwork to better understand individual susceptibility to stress and underlying epigenetic mechanisms, which may help to inform novel interventions to reduce stress and prevent preterm birth.",Maternal Stress and Preterm Birth:  Role of Genome and Epigenome,9582843,R03HD096136,"['Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Boston ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environmental Health ', ' Environmental Health Science ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Health ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methodology ', ' Mothers ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Physicians ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Pre-Eclampsia ', ' pregnancy toxemia/hypertension ', ' Proteinuria-Edema-Hypertension Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy Toxemias ', ' Preeclampsia ', ' EPH Gestosis ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Premature Birth ', ' preterm delivery ', ' premature delivery ', ' premature childbirth ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Pre-term birth ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Emotional disorder ', ' Discipline ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' Measurement ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Live Birth ', ' experience ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Reporting ', ' maternal stress ', ' stressed mothers ', ' infant morbidity ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Low income ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' genomic variant ', ' allelic variant ', ' allele variant ', ' Gene variant ', ' genetic variant ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' modifiable risk ', ' high risk ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' stress disorder ', ' epigenome ', ' 37 weeks completed gestation ', ' 37 weeks gestation ', ' Child Health ', ' ']",NICHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R03,2018,81850,0.03310563612761168
"Projection-specific gene expression in resilience to chronic stress Project Summary Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects ~4% of the worldwide population, and these numbers are continuously increasing. Moreover, MDD disproportionately affects women, who are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with the disease. Thus, uncovering the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms underlying susceptibility and resilience to depression is critical. Recent work demonstrates that ventral hippocampal (vHPC) projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulate mood and susceptibility to stress. Our group has shown that the transcription factor ΔFosB is crucial for hippocampal cell morphology and learning, and several lines of evidence implicate hippocampal ΔFosB in depressive-like behaviors (e.g., FosB knockout mice have hippocampal malformations and depressive behaviors, and current antidepressants induce ΔFosB in vHPC). However, to date there is no study characterizing the role of hippocampal ΔFosB in stress resilience and depression. To this end, we have produced a novel dual-virus CRISPR-Cas9 system allowing knockout of FosB gene expression specifically in vHPC cells projecting to the NAc. In combination with our many well-vetted molecular, physiological, and behavioral tools and models, this will allow us to address the central hypothesis that ΔFosB expression in vHPC neurons projecting to NAc mediates cell function and resilience to social stress in male and female mice. To test this hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims. In Aim I, we will first characterize the epigenetic mechanisms of induction of the FosB gene in hippocampus by chronic stress, determine its role in resilience to stress in both males and females, and uncover its transcriptional targets in vHPC. Indeed, our preliminary data show that inhibition of ΔFosB in vHPC induces susceptibility to depression-like symptoms. In Aim II, we will examine the stress induction and cellular effects of ΔFosB in vHPC neurons with projections to various brain regions, including NAc, then use our novel dual-virus system to knock down FosB gene expression specifically in vHPC cells projecting to the NAc and observe the behavioral results on stress responses. Here, too, we have strong preliminary data suggesting that ΔFosB regulates the excitability of vHPC neurons, and that ΔFosB expression in the vHPC- NAc projection cells regulates susceptibility to depression. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the critical role of ΔFosB in stress-induced changes in hippocampal control of limbic circuitry of both males and females, as well as identify novel ΔFosB targets that could serve as potential points for sex-specific therapeutic intervention in depression or PTSD. Stressful and traumatic experiences can contribute to mood disorders in some individuals while others are resilient to this process, and though we know that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in stress responses, there is a critical gap in our knowledge of how changes in hippocampal gene expression may drive resilience to stress. The proposed work seeks to delineate the role of ΔFosB, a transcription factor induced by stress, in the changes in gene transcription and cell physiology of hippocampal neurons that project to specific brain targets to mediate resilience to stress. This work is relevant to NIMH’s high priority interest in research utilizing sex as a biological variable and investigating mental health disparities, and utilizes innovative techniques to uncover basic pathophysiology that may be exploited as novel therapeutic interventions in major depressive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder.",Projection-specific gene expression in resilience to

"Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Title: Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer  Prostate cancer disproportionately affects African American (AA) men with higher incidence, mortality and aggressive disease. Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress such as neighborhood factors are widely regarded as the foremost driver of such health disparities however their association and translation to biological stress and mechanisms on pathogenesis are poorly understood. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) modulates stress response and has been suggested to mediate social stress induced effects on cellular physiology racial disparities in cancer outcomes. HPA-axis modulates cortisol levels controlling the glucocorticoid (GC) response following a social stress. In addition to cortisol, Leptin levels have been also demonstrated as effectors of stress response. Such stress hormones can modulate cancel cell signaling affecting pathogenesis and outcomes. MicroRNAs are epigenetic elements that are highly stable noncoding small 21-23nt gene- regulatory RNAs acting primarily by targeting 3’UTRs; their roles have been studied in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis as well as biomarkers of resistance and aggressive PCa. We have recently identified racially distinct differentially expressed miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids (serum and urine) as potential biomarker. Both Glucocorticoid and leptin signaling have been shown to affect the expression of miRNAs in human and laboratory models. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesize that social and neighborhood factors translate into continuous biological stress perturbing the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and leptin resulting in alteration of epigenetic machinery including expression of miRNAs. The proposal will analyze circulating microRNAs and stress hormone levels in African American (AA) prostate cancer patients of the Washington DC metro area with differential socioeconomic status and social stress. Next, we will study the interplay between stress hormones and selected microRNAs in modulating cancer hallmarks. Finally, we will study miRNA-targets-stress markers by identifying miRNA targets and pathways involved to mechanistically characterize selected miRNAs for pathways modulated during social stress. This study will bridge the gap between social factors and biological determinants by studying logical epigenetic mechanisms modulated by social stress and causing health disparities. Understanding these biological implications of social stress will significantly impact diagnosis, prognosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa in African Americans.

"Addressing Intersecting Minority Stress: Development of an mHealth HIV Prevention Intervention for Young Black Men   PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) account for the highest proportion of new HIV  diagnoses in the United States. Although recent studies suggest that racial and sexual minority discrimination  may contribute to this trend, minority stress models do not frequently account for the intersectional effects of  these forms of discrimination among YBMSM. As a result, current HIV prevention interventions are not  equipped to intervene upon the stress process caused by intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination  that contributes to HIV risk. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will support the  candidate during his upcoming years of research and training focused on examining the role of intersecting  racial and sexual minority discrimination in HIV risk among YBMSM. The goal of the candidate’s research is to  test an intersectional minority stress model that incorporates HIV-­relevant biological, psychological, and  behavioral outcomes and indicators of stress among YBMSM. The results of this study will inform the  development of an mHealth intervention to promote effective coping to mitigate these minority stress pathways.  To accomplish these goals, the candidate requires training and mentorship in three areas: 1) assessing  biological indicators of stress;; 2) examining intersectional minority stress and HIV risk among YBMSM;; and 3)  designing and testing HIV-­focused mHealth interventions. Training through a combination of mentorship,  professional engagement, coursework, trainings, conferences, and mentored research projects will directly  support the candidate to effectively implement the specific research aims. The overarching aims of the  research projects are to: 1) Conduct a two-­week EMA study with 100 HIV-­negative YBMSM to assess the  intersection of racial and sexual minority discrimination on self-­reported emotion dysregulation and  psychological distress, biological indicators of stress, and behavioral HIV risk;; 2) Test an intersectional minority  stress model with the EMA data that examines two hypotheses: a) emotion dysregulation mediates  associations from intersecting discrimination to psychological distress and behavioral HIV risk;; b) coping  moderates the negative impact of intersecting discrimination on psychological distress, biological indicators of  stress, and behavioral HIV risk;; and 3) Utilize evidence from Aims 1 and 2 to design and pilot an mHealth  intervention to mitigate the negative impacts of intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination on HIV  risk and prevention among YBMSM. Together, these research projects will address essential questions about  the role of intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination in HIV risk among YBMSM, identify modifiable  targets for intervention, and examine preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and effect estimates of a novel  mHealth intervention to address these targets. The training and research plan will aid the candidate to develop  into an independent multidisciplinary investigator focused on creating innovative and high-­impact interventions  to reduce persistent HIV inequities for YBMSM.     Project Narrative. Given the overwhelming burden of HIV among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in the United States, there is a need for innovative, culturally-relevant, and accessible interventions to reduce their HIV risk. The present research is designed to test an intersectional minority stress model that examines the psychological, biological and behavioral effects of intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination on HIV risk among YBMSM. The goal of this research is to develop and pilot an mHealth intervention that promotes effective coping and reduces the negative impact of intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination on HIV inequities among YBMSM.",Addressing Intersecting Minority Stress: Development of an mHealth HIV Prevention Intervention for Young Black Men,9695508,K01MH118091,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Goals ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Literature ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' NIMH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS/HIV prevention ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Event ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' twenty years of age ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 years of age ', ' 20 year old ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' stem ', ' coping mechanism ', ' sexual minority ', ' RDoC ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' mHealth ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' racial minority ', ' intersectionality ', ' PrEP ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' ']",NIMH,HUNTER COLLEGE,K01,2018,188372,0.041862966700303005
"Biopsychosocial Mechanisms Linking Gender Minority Stress to HIV Comorbidities Project Summary/Abstract Despite a high prevalence of HIV among gender minority women, very little is known about HIV comorbid conditions in this population. Understanding the mechanisms of underlying HIV-related comorbidities in this health disparity population is an important step toward advancing health equity. The address this gap in knowledge, the study seeks to elucidate pathways linking stigma and physiologic stress to HIV comorbidities among Black and Latina gender minority women. The specific aims of the project include to: (1) quantify the longitudinal relationship of stigma to chronic stress biomarkers; (2) identify pathways linking chronic stress biomarkers to HIV comorbidities; and (3) examine the role of chronic stress in pathways linking stigma, sex hormones, and HIV comorbidities. These aims will be met using existing NIH-funded cohort platforms to enroll and follow 200 participants in a 24-month, mixed-methods, prospective study to measure stigma, biomarkers of chronic stress, sex hormones, mental health, and CVD risk. Data will be collected at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-months. This longitudinal study blends in-depth-interviews and quantitative psychosocial research with clinical and biological measures to advance understanding of the complex relationships between social experiences and physical health. This innovative research will identify mechanisms underlying associations between stigma and HIV comorbidities. It has important implications for interventions with health disparity populations living with HIV and will provide novel information that can be used to guide clinical practice and reduce health disparities. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance A disproportionate number of gender minority women are living with HIV in the United States, yet information about mechanisms of disparities for their HIV-related comorbidities is quite limited.

"Precarious Employment as a Determinant of Overweight and Cardiometabolic Risk PROJECT SUMMARY Reducing obesity disparities could greatly reduce health disparities by race/ethnicity for the leading cause of death in the U.S., cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, it is critical to understand the systemic causes of disparities in obesity prevalence between racial/ethnic minority adults and children, compared to their white counterparts. “Precarious employment,” which is often characterized by low wages, limited fringe benefits, shorter tenure, and irregular hours, making employment risky and stressful for the worker, is disproportionately represented among racial/ethnic minorities. Precarious employment may increase body mass index through multiple mechanisms including, a biological stress response. Determining the extent to which precarious employment is a determinate of overweight and cardiometabolic risk is vitally important for mitigating disparities in chronic disease risk and informing structural approaches for improving population health in the U.S. The proposed work in this Pathway to Independence Award builds upon my current program of research investigating the role of employment status and conditions in overweight risk and enhances it by adding training in areas that are critical to accomplishing my career goal: establishing an independent research program that rigorously investigates the role of employment status and conditions as a determinate of racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease risk. The training portion of this project includes coursework, guided readings, and career- building activities to gain skills in three areas: 1) causal inference methodologies; 2) the study of stress and CVD, and 3) racial/ethnic health disparities. The newly acquired skills and knowledge obtained during the training phase of this award will be applied in the research phase of the study. The research phase of the study aims to provide novel insights into the impacts of precarious employment on overweight and cardiometabolic risk, and to investigate the pathways of these relationships. We will leverage three unique datasets, two racially/ethnically diverse longitudinal cohorts with complementary employment and biological data (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health), and objective data on work activities and organization (Occupational Information Network Database), to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) determine the extent to which precarious employment affects overweight/obesity risk among adults and children in the U.S. and examine whether any association varies by race/ethnicity; 2) determine whether biological stress mediates the association between precarious employment and BMI and overweight/obesity risk among adults; 3) determine whether precarious employment is associated with cardiometabolic risk biomarkers among adults and examine whether any association varies by race/ethnicity; and 3a) determine whether overweight/obesity and biological stress mediate the association between precarious employment and cardiometabolic risk. Employment precariousness is modifiable through policy-level changes, making this a critical topic for study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reducing obesity disparities could greatly reduce health disparities by race/ethnicity for the leading cause of death in the U.S., cardiovascular disease.

"Acculturation, Stress, and Adolescent Health. Project Summary/Abstract  Population surveillance data indicate disparities in many outcomes for Hispanic youth. The past several decades have witnessed a burgeoning interest in the role of cultural factors in Hispanic youth development, with a focus on the cultural challenges these youth face. Indeed, in the US, Hispanic youth – 70% if whom are from immigrant families – are faced with the challenge of acculturation – the process by which youth retain their cultural heritage and/or adopt the new receiving culture. This process may not only be stressful in itself, but may also be exacerbated by the long-standing political rhetoric characterizing Hispanic immigrants as criminals and as a drain on the country. Increasingly anti-Hispanic and xenophobic attitudes in the United States have created an increasingly hostile environment for Hispanic immigrants. This hostility helps to create culturally stressful experiences. A growing literature has examined whether such cultural stress influences various developmental outcomes, using a range of instruments to measure various facets of cultural stress. However, no existing scale is comprehensive enough to assess the nuances of cultural stressors faced by Hispanic youth.  The scientific premise of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive and rigorous measure of cultural stress. Towards this end, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Conduct qualitative focus groups with Hispanic youth from two major metropolitan areas of the US (Miami and Los Angeles) and use content analysis to lay the foundation for a new culturally grounded and psychometrically refined cultural stress assessment; 2) Assess the reliability of the new multidimensional instrument using Exploratory Factor (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) techniques and assess measurement invariance across age, gender, site, and immigration status using multi-group CFA techniques; 3) Evaluate the extent to which cultural stress is uniquely different from other forms of stress (i.e., normative, economic, neighborhood, and family stress) and test the predictive validity of cultural stress with youth outcomes (delinquency, aggression, depressive symptoms, drug and alcohol use, and well-being); and 4) establish diagnostic cut-off values for the cultural stress measure.  Our approach is innovative for several reasons. First, we use samples drawn from two distinct immigration gateway communities, ensuring we capture heterogeneity in terms both of acculturative experiences and nationality, immigration status, and demographic composition. Second, we use focus-groups to “unpack” cultural stress to provide a more dynamic perspective of Hispanic youths' lives, with greater detail on what they consider “stressful” given their own struggles and challenges. Third, we establish divergent and convergent validity vis-à-vis normative, economic, neighborhood, and family stress to test whether the developed instrument is empirically distinct from other stressors. Our proposed research is significant because it lays the groundwork for a comprehensive operationalization of cultural stress that is empirically distinct from other sources of stress. This is a necessary first step toward understanding the impact of cultural stress on Hispanic youth and toward identifying intervention mechanisms and targets. Project Narrative: Public Health Relevance The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will provide comprehensive, and contextually and developmentally appropriate, measure of cultural stress that is empirically distinct from other stressors. Such a measure will open up the possibility of accurately understanding the impact of cultural stress on substance use and youth outcomes. Such research will serve as an important foundational step prior to the development of evidence-based programs designed to support Hispanic youth in navigating the challenge of acculturation (the process by which youth retain their cultural heritage and/or adopt the new receiving culture). The proposed project is highly relevant to NICHD's mission because it constitutes a critical step toward ensuring that Hispanic youth can achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.","Acculturation, Stress, and Adolescent Health.",9543736,R21HD095636,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Attitude ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hostility ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mission ', ' Nationalities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Politics ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Running ', ' Schools ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Immigrant ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' metropolitan ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' cultural values ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Subgroup ', ' Sum ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Stress Tests ', ' NIAAA ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based program ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' surveillance data ', ' screening ', ' behavior outcome ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' school district ', ' adolescent health ', ' Cuban ', ' predictive assay ', ' predictive test ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2018,171365,0.12673430158449295
"Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Title: Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer  Prostate cancer disproportionately affects African American (AA) men with higher incidence, mortality and aggressive disease. Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress such as neighborhood factors are widely regarded as the foremost driver of such health disparities however their association and translation to biological stress and mechanisms on pathogenesis are poorly understood. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) modulates stress response and has been suggested to mediate social stress induced effects on cellular physiology racial disparities in cancer outcomes. HPA-axis modulates cortisol levels controlling the glucocorticoid (GC) response following a social stress. In addition to cortisol, Leptin levels have been also demonstrated as effectors of stress response. Such stress hormones can modulate cancel cell signaling affecting pathogenesis and outcomes. MicroRNAs are epigenetic elements that are highly stable noncoding small 21-23nt gene- regulatory RNAs acting primarily by targeting 3’UTRs; their roles have been studied in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis as well as biomarkers of resistance and aggressive PCa. We have recently identified racially distinct differentially expressed miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids (serum and urine) as potential biomarker. Both Glucocorticoid and leptin signaling have been shown to affect the expression of miRNAs in human and laboratory models. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesize that social and neighborhood factors translate into continuous biological stress perturbing the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and leptin resulting in alteration of epigenetic machinery including expression of miRNAs. The proposal will analyze circulating microRNAs and stress hormone levels in African American (AA) prostate cancer patients of the Washington DC metro area with differential socioeconomic status and social stress. Next, we will study the interplay between stress hormones and selected microRNAs in modulating cancer hallmarks. Finally, we will study miRNA-targets-stress markers by identifying miRNA targets and pathways involved to mechanistically characterize selected miRNAs for pathways modulated during social stress. This study will bridge the gap between social factors and biological determinants by studying logical epigenetic mechanisms modulated by social stress and causing health disparities. Understanding these biological implications of social stress will significantly impact diagnosis, prognosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa in African Americans.

"Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health problems are proportionately affect racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as populations that face chronic economic hardship (Evans, Wolf & Adler, 2012). There is clear evidence that (1) the processes that lay the groundwork for mental health disparities is laid during childhood (e.g., Chen & Miller, 2012) and (2) that damage to and dysregulation of the physiologic stress response is a powerful mechanism of the effects of chronic stress such as that associated with poverty on psychopathology (e.g., Evans & Kim, 2012). To contribute solutions to mental health disparities, we need interventions capable of affecting the systems that confer the risk. Since the psychobiologic stress response system (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis; HPA) is a central mechanism linking health disparities to chronic stress, the stress response is a critical system to target. Improving children's ability to cope with stress and regulate their reactivity ha the potential to break the cycle of damage, especially if the coping strategies and regulatory processes that we target have effects at the physiologic level. Preliminary evidence from the PIs research lab has emerged showing that different types of coping are evident at the level of the HPA-it is, therefore, time to evaluate whether a coping intervention designed for children facing chronic stress will both (a) improve children's ability to use primary and secondary control coping, and (b) have sustained effects at the physiologic level. We have developed just such an intervention, which builds on these exciting new findings and is designed to address core underlying mechanisms of risk and repair in the highly stressful context of poor, urban youths' lives.  Preadolescence is a crucial time during which children's ability to recognize stress and it causes matures, and repertoires for coping with stress grow in both size and complexity. In addition, preadolescence is a time of increased brain changes and growth in key self-regulatory organs and systems. Preadolescents are, therefore, at a ripe stage to benefit from coping-based prevention and the plasticity of this developmental period suggests that such changes have the potential to be long-lasting. Our new prevention program is designed to prevent the onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in preadolescent children facing chronic stress. Two mechanisms of action are targeted in this project. First, the project seeks to demonstrate that children facing chronic stress stemming from poverty, discrimination, and violence exposure can acquire and utilize new ways of coping that are adaptive in a wide variety of circumstances. Second, the project will examine the extent to which improved coping resulting from the intervention engages the physiologic intermediate mechanism of the HPA. Finally, the project aims to link changes in coping and the HPA to changes in internalizing symptoms that would signal prevention of the emergence of new or worsening of existing symptoms. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system that leads to psychopathology can offer new directions for combatting health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and socioeconomic disparities in physical and mental health problems are large, persistent, and severe; begin during childhood; and stem from in part damage to physiologic stress response systems caused by chronic stress. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system may offer new directions for combatting health disparities. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a new prevention program designed to teach preadolescent children effective ways for coping with chronic stress that will have direct effects on their physiologic stress response systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and ultimately prevent onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms and disorders.",Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress,9570093,R33MH107631,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Wolves ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' preadolescence ', ' preteen ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenic ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' R21/R33 Program ', ' R21/R33 Mechanism ', ' Phased Innovation Awards ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' psychobiological ', ' psychobiologic ', ' stem ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' intervention effect ', ' coping mechanism ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' violence victimization ', ' racial minority ', ' psychological symptom ', ' stress symptom ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' ']",NIMH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R33,2018,588854,0.18156684209296528
"Mechanisms Underlying Sexual Minority Health Disparities in the United States Project Summary/Abstract Families headed by sexual and gender minorities are a growing segment of the population, yet sexual and gender minority health disparities in areas including self-rated health, chronic conditions, health behaviors, and depression persist. Minority stress has been implicated as a key cause of health problems, and family functioning, emotion regulation, couple-level minority stress, and community contexts have been identified as potential mechanisms underlying these associations. Contemporary theoretical models have yet to be tested due to a lack of data, and further, this lack of data has made studies of the intersection of racial and ethnic minority stress with sexual and gender minority stress difficult. This project will produce the first population- representative, multi-method, fully-powered study of cohabiting and married sexual and gender minorities and their partners, and a comparison sample of cis-gender individuals in different-gender unions. Aim 1. Evaluate whether and how family functioning (e.g. relationship quality) mediates the negative effects of stress due to discrimination on physical and mental health and health behaviors. Aim 2. Using an experience sampling method embedded in a time-diary, examine 1) the mediating role of emotion regulation, and 2) dyadic stress processes in the association between stress and subsequent health behaviors and time-use among same- gender couples. Aim 3. Investigate the association between community-level factors including economic disadvantage, access to healthcare, and the sexual and gender minority political climate (i.e. state employment protections) and sexual and gender minorities’ physical and mental health and health behaviors. Aim 4. Determine race and ethnic health gaps among sexual [and gender] minorities and evaluate potential protective factors that may minimize these gaps. We will recruit 2690 US adults aged 18 to 60 who are cohabiting or married to same- and different-gender partners, along with their partners. The sample will include an oversample of respondents of color. Population-representative Gallup samples afford a unique and efficient opportunity to study sexual and gender minorities who are in unions via targeted sampling. Using a mobile phone application platform, we will also collect time-diary and experience sampling method data. The primary significance of this project is 1) the identification of family functioning and emotion regulation as mediators of sexual and gender minority stress due to stigma and discrimination and poor physical and psychological health and health behaviors, and 2) the collection of dyadic data that will elucidate dyadic minority stress processes. The proposed research is innovative because it is the first contemporary, population-representative study of sexual and gender minority health that includes family functioning, emotion regulation, and dyadic data and an oversample of racial and ethnic minorities. These data will help researchers better understand how to improve the health of sexual and gender minorities by illuminating potential mechanisms underlying health disparities. Data will be available to scholars across the world through ICPSR and the American Heritage Time Use Study. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because 1) the identification of family functioning and emotion regulation as mediators of sexual and gender minority stress due to stigma and discrimination and poor physical and psychological health and health behaviors, 2) the collection of dyadic data critical to testing dyadic minority stress processes, and 3) the examination of the intersection of sexual and gender minority stress and racial and ethnic minority stress, are ultimately expected to lead to new evidence-based interventions and policies designed to improve adult and child wellbeing across American family contexts. Overall, the primary positive impact will be evidence that will be applicable to clinical and community settings to set adults and children in the families of sexual and gender minorities on successful developmental trajectories. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to that part of the NICHD's mission that all Americans are able to develop to their full capability so that their lives, and intimate relationships, may be healthy, gratifying, and long.",Mechanisms Underlying Sexual Minority Health Disparities in the United States,9596545,R01HD094081,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Welfare ', ' child wellbeing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Family Research ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Marriage ', ' Masks ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Respondent ', ' diaries ', ' Complex ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' member ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Legal ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' community setting ', ' population based ', ' sexual minority ', ' cisgender ', ' racial minority ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' intersectionality ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NICHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,742113,0.05133594186921245
"Early Life Mechanisms of Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma-Related Risk in Offspring: Epigenetic and Neurodevelopmental Pathways PROJECT SUMMARY: Evidence suggests that the effects of trauma exposure can be transmitted across generations to shape pathways to psychological impairment in offspring, with the perinatal period identified as pivotal to these processes. Although the mechanisms and timing of these effects are not well elucidated, an emerging literature focuses on the influence of maternal posttraumatic stress (PTS) during pregnancy. PTS affects up to 40% of pregnant women, particularly those from low-income, minority populations with documented health disparities. Maternal PTS may interrupt healthy development of biological stress systems in offspring, namely the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis, a well-defined biological pathway that is modulated by environmental and genetic factors. Recent studies have begun to link maternal PTS with biobehavioral indicators of stress reactivity in offspring, and these so-called intermediate phenotypes may serve as early markers of stress-related psychopathology, which can emerge in infancy and have cascading and disabling effects across the lifespan. Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation, are hypothesized to play a critical role in influencing these processes. This hypothesis builds on studies, mainly in adults, linking PTS with DNA methylation of genes implicated in HPA axis functionality and candidate gene studies showing effects of maternal trauma exposure on DNA methylation in adult offspring. Notably, pilot data from our lab link maternal PTS during pregnancy with newborn infant DNA methylation of a single gene (FKBP5) implicated in the stress response. No study has yet applied an epigenomic approach, which offers a more holistic and unbiased method of discovery, for examining intergenerational transmission of trauma. We propose an exploratory study to prospectively explore predictive relationships between maternal pregnancy PTS, genome- wide methylation patterns in offspring at birth, multi-level biobehavioral indicators of infant stress reactivity at 6 months (i.e., respiratory sinus arrhythmia, heart rate, cortisol, observed distress), during a laboratory stress challenge, and key elements of the caregiving environment (i.e. observed maternal sensitivity, family support, family stressors), which may moderate these intergenerational effects. We build from extensive pilot work in our laboratory and an established research infrastructure for recruitment and retention. This work, which aligns well with the priorities of the National Institute of Child Health and Development is essential for delineating the origins of stress-related psychopathology and informing the optimal targets and timing for effective preventative interventions. Project Narrative/Public health relevance: Improved understanding of biological mechanisms by which extreme stress experienced early in life shapes the developing stress response system and contributes to the pathogenesis of psychopathology is critical for identifying sensitive periods when extreme stress may have the most detrimental impact and driving novel approaches to prevention and intervention.",Early Life Mechanisms of Intergenerational Transmission of Trauma-Related Risk in Offspring: Epigenetic and Neurodevelopmental Pathways,9547895,R21HD090379,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Sinus Arrhythmia ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Buffers ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Follow-Up Studies ', ' Followup Studies ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Infant ', ' Newborn Infant ', ' newborn children ', ' newborn child ', ' Newborns ', ' 0-4 weeks old ', ' Institutes ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' Mothers ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Phenotype ', ' Play ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Third Pregnancy Trimester ', ' Third Trimester ', ' Last Trimester ', ' 3rd trimester ', ' Pregnant Women ', ' pregnant mothers ', ' expecting mother ', ' expectant mother ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Distress ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' insight ', ' Recovery ', ' Genetic ', ' Shapes ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' postnatal ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' respiratory ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' intergenerational ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' offspring ', ' Adult Children ', ' Adult Sons ', ' Adult Offspring ', ' Adult Daughters ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Low income ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Data ', ' Interruption ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Process ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' epigenomics ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Minority ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' Approaches to prevention ', ' Prevention approach ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' Impairment ', ' public health relevance ', ' genomewide ', ' genome scale ', ' genome-wide ', ' global methylation ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' epigenetic biomarker ', ' epigenetic marker ', ' methylation pattern ', ' stress reactivity ', ' family support ', ' recruit ', ' Child Health ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' perinatal phase ', ' perinatal period ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCH OF MED/DNT,R21,2018,199375,0.08447763305113044
"Social adversities, epigenetics, and the obesity epidemic Project Summary. This application is being submitted in response to PAR-16-355, Social Epigenomics Research Focused on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R01), and the overarching long-term goal of this research effort is to learn how to positively influence health trajectories, modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for obesity in youth. Obesity was selected as the primary health outcome as it is a health measure with widening racial/ethnic disparities over the past three decades, and it is a potent predictor of a host of negative social, educational, vocational, and health outcomes later in life. In this study we propose to leverage two ongoing prenatal cohorts in Florida and North Carolina, and recruit a sample of 470 pregnant women and follow their children to 24 months of age. The sample will be enriched for adversity in pregnancy and approximately evenly divided among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic subjects. We will assess the impact of mothers' prenatal stress on measures of DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which are homogenous in terms of cellular composition, and widely accepted as an optimal choice for examining in utero responses to stressors. In the epigenetic analyses we will use both targeted and big data approaches, using pyrosequencing to measure methylation of 31 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate ~90 known imprinted genes, and the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC (850k) bead chip for whole epigenome analyses. We will also assess maternal and child postnatal psychosocial stress exposure, and child growth in the first 24 months of life. Children who are overweight at any point during the first two years of life have an approximately six-fold increased risk for obesity at five years of age, and risk for chronic health problems across the lifecycle. The primary hypotheses of this study build on preliminary work from our group and include: 1) Maternal prenatal stress will be associated with increased DMRs regulating the expression of imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) DMR, increased methylation in Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CAMK4) gene, and methylation changes in novel CpG sites identified in the 850K analyses; 2) DNA methylation profile changes associated with prenatal stress will be related to alterations in gene expression; and 3) Methylation markers identified in Aim 1 will predict growth trajectories and measures of obesity at 24 months of age. Secondary analyses will examine several moderating factors, including: maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), maternal social supports, maternal postnatal psychosocial distress, postnatal offspring ACE, genetic variants, and relevant confounding variables. The mediating role of inflammatory markers will also be explored, and saliva DNA specimens will be collected on the full cohort at 24-months and 50 children at birth, allowing for tests of comparability of DNA methylation between HUVECs and saliva, and the stability of markers over time. Project Narrative. Chronic exposure to psychosocial stress often accompanies the experience of poverty and racial/ethnic minority status, and may be causally related to health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for negative health outcomes to learn how to best modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce

"Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now large-scale epidemiological evidence that aspects of chronic psychological stress, such as early adversity or job strain, and early life stress, predict earlier disease onset and mortality. Despite documentation of the importance of stress to health, there are several critical barriers that prevent progress in the epidemiological study of stress as a risk factor for disease. Measurement of stress is inherently complex and multi-level (e.g., social, psychological, physiological). There are few agreed upon 'gold standard' measures of stress, hence measurement is often inconsistent and superficial where heterogeneous constructs are conflated. There is also little understanding of the conditions under which stress exposure can promote vulnerability vs. resiliency to disease. Meanwhile, there have been rapid advances in the basic science of stress processes, which have helped to unpack the cognitive and affective components, links to brain and peripheral physiological responses, and richer measures of daily stress - e.g., through ecological momentary assessments using technology to obtain detailed profiles of exposures and contexts. Thus, epidemiological stress science can benefit from a more coherent multilevel model that encompasses better measurement of lifespan exposures and responses, including the social, psychological, and physiological indices of stress that have the greatest impact on health. The proposed R24 will recruit excellent scientists with relevant methods to apply their interests to th advancement of stress measurement across human development, with a focus on how lifespan stress affects health in mid to late life. Aims include: 1) Development of a stress measurement taxonomy, including guidelines for best measurement; 2) Development of a 'toolbox' of short measures of stress that can be used in epidemiological studies of adult aging internationally. These will be drawn from innovative measurement from basic experimental and field research, refinement/shortening of existing measures, and results from comparative validation of promising measures; and 3) Promotion of stress research in epidemiological studies of aging, both through harmonizing existing measures and adding new toolbox measures. This in turn will lead to discoveries that refine the taxonomy and research methodologies. Improved stress measurement offers tremendous opportunities for advancing the field of basic research, enhancing the efficacy of health-promotion interventions and policy. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic stress can impair health, but the mechanisms are not well known and the measures that investigators use are diverse and inconsistent. This network will promote better theory and new measures, and develop a ""stress measurement toolbox,"" that large-scale studies can use. This in turn will lead to a deeper understanding of how stress affects psychological well-being as well as disease etiology and progression, and ways to intervene.",Advancing Psychosocial & Biobehavioral Stress Measurement to Understanding Aging,9481225,R24AG048024,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Foundations ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human Development ', ' indexing ', ' Internships ', ' intern ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Paper ', ' Physiology ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Play ', ' Psychology ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Technology ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Taxonomy ', ' General Taxonomy ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Peripheral ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' R24 ', ' R-24 Monoclonal Antibody ', ' MoAb R24 ', ' Monoclonal Antibody R24 ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' Scientist ', ' Well in self ', ' sense of wellbeing ', ' self wellness ', ' psychological wellness ', ' psychological wellbeing ', ' mental wellbeing ', ' mental well-being ', ' emotional wellbeing ', ' Sense of well-being ', ' Psychological Well Being ', ' Normal psyche ', ' Normal mental state ', ' Normal mental condition ', ' Feels well ', ' Emotional well being ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' validation studies ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Impaired health ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Documentation ', ' Skin ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' International ', ' Subgroup ', ' Cognitive ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' website ', ' web site ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Affective ', ' comparative ', ' critical period ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population based ', ' standard measure ', ' population health ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' study population ', ' recruit ', ' early life stress ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R24,2018,376418,0.1939187416217695
"Ethnic Influences on Stress, Energy Balance and Obesity in Adolescents Obesity is one of the most serious public health problems in the US; its prevalence has tripled in the last three decades and is associated with a range of short- and long-term medical and psychosocial problems. Adolescence is a critical period for the development and persistence of obesity, and is associated with changes in diet, physical activity and fitness, fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. There are racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity. African-American (AA) females have the highest rates of obesity, and the clustered risk factors for coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome are twice that of AA males. The reasons for racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity are not well understood. AA experience higher stress levels than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) due to economic and social inequalities, and the effect of stress on energy-dense diet and adiposity is more prominent in females. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link stress to obesity, particularly during adolescence when high rates of obesity, increased stressful experiences and stronger behavioral and physiological responses to stress emerge, will contribute to new clinical guidelines for reducing obesity and associated medical conditions in AA females.  The Physiological stress system affects obesity and mediates its adaptive functions via hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Prolonged stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion promotes the consumption of energy-dense diet (EI) and abdominal fat deposition both directly and indirectly through its effects on metabolic hormones. Stress also reduces physical activity and alters energy balance. The proposed study will examine the effects of stress and HPA axis on EI and physical activity-related energy expenditure in 100 AA and 100 NHW adolescent females. The effects on EI will be assessed in two contexts, the natural environment and under controlled conditions incorporating a standardized psychosocial stressor. Stress will be assessed in the natural environment as multiple domains (i.e., individual, family and social), and several indices of the HPA axis will be obtained to represent diurnal variation, its status over 12-15 weeks and reactivity to stress. Obesity- related parameters will be measured through anthropometry, fat distribution and cardio-metabolic biomarkers.  Associations among stress, HPA activity/function, energy balance and obesity-related parameters will be compared between and within AA and NHW samples. In combination they will improve our understanding of the social factors and biobehavioral mechanisms of both racial and individual differences in obesity and facilitate the development of effective treatments within and across racial groups according to the principles of individualized medicine. To our knowledge, racial differences in objectively-measured diet intake and energy expenditure in response to stress, or their underlying physiological mechanisms, have not been assessed in adolescents or adults. This is an important knowledge gap in our efforts to develop better evidence-based translational obesity prevention and weight-control interventions as the traditional interventions are not effective with minority youth. Obesity carries a substantial burden, and often develops in adolescence, persists into adult life and is almost twice as prevalent in African-American women compared to Caucasian women. We will test whether African- American girls consume more sweet and fatty foods and engage in less physical activity when stressed than Caucasians girls, and if stress hormones explain these differences. We will also test whether the differences in diet, activity and hormones account for the higher rates of obesity in African-American girls.","Ethnic Influences on Stress, Energy Balance and Obesity in Adolescents",9441046,R01MD010757,"['suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Composition ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Client ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Economics ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Family ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Female ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' indexing ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Morbidity -

"Minority Stress Reactivity and Hazardous Drinking PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disparities in hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been documented across several disadvantaged groups (e.g., racial/ethnic and sexual minorities). Hazardous drinking and its consequences are a major public health priority and concern given their significant economic, mortality, and morbidity burdens. Stigma and discrimination-related stressors (i.e., minority stressors) contribute to our understanding of health disparities among these groups. Given the importance of minority stressors in predicting hazardous drinking, the research aims of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) are to conduct a rigorous, innovative, and multi-method examination of minority stress and its effects on drinking in the lab and the natural environment among one disadvantaged health disparities group. Sexual minority (SM; i.e., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) adults are at increased risk for hazardous drinking compared to heterosexuals. SMs experience minority stressors, which range from daily and momentary slights to more acute forms of stigma, and are directly correlated with hazardous drinking. However, major limitations of the extant SM literature include the lack of objective measures of reactivity to minority stressors (i.e., biological markers), overreliance on cross-sectional data, and failure to account for individual differences in appraisals of minority stress or the contributions of minority stress on hazardous drinking beyond individual differences in daily general stress and lifetime cumulative stress. In addition, little is known about mediating mechanisms between minority stress and hazardous drinking. Consistent with Institute of Medicine and NIH’s call to expand the scientific knowledge base on factors contributing to SMs’ elevated rates of drinking, the research aims of this K08 are to: 1) examine the effects of psychophysiological mechanisms underpinning appraised minority stress and alcohol craving in a lab experiment of 70 SMs who are at most risk for developing AUD (i.e., heavy drinkers); and 2) use experience sampling methods (i.e., EMA) over a 30-day period, to examine: a) the effects of psychophysiological stress reactivity from the lab on minority stress reactivity and drinking in the natural environment and b) the prospective effects of minority stress on proximal changes in affect and drinking and its consequences in real time. While conducting this research and participating in several training and mentorship activities, the K08 candidate will develop new expertise in: 1) experimental laboratory research; 2) psychophysiological stress research and salivary research methodology; 3) experience sampling field methods (i.e., EMA); and 4) advanced statistical approaches for analyzing intensive longitudinal EMA quantitative data and physiological salivary laboratory data. This proposed project builds upon the candidate’s past work examining the associations between minority stressors and health outcomes among sexual and racial/ethnic minorities. Completion of this K08 award will provide the candidate necessary skills to be an independent researcher capable of advancing our knowledge of stress-specific factors predicting hazardous drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Sexual minorities (SMs; i.e., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) are at increased risk for hazardous drinking, alcohol- related consequences, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) than heterosexuals. Hazardous drinking and its consequences are a major public health concern given resulting economic, societal, mortality, and morbidity burdens. The project will address how SMs’ experiences with stigma-based stressors related to their sexual orientation (i.e., minority stressors) are associated with hazardous drinking in order to inform and develop alcohol interventions and improve the well-being of SMs.",Minority Stress Reactivity and Hazardous Drinking,9530549,K08AA025011,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Award ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Visualization ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' System ', ' alcohol craving ', ' ethanol craving ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' drinking ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' alcohol intervention ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' alcohol related consequences ', ' public health priorities ', ' sexual minority ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' lab experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' prospective test ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variation ', ' ']",NIAAA,AMERICAN UNIVERSITY,K08,2018,169287,0.054046268566919894
"Sleep, Biological Stress, and Health among Toddlers Living in Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Homes PROJECT SUMMARY Healthy sleep is important to behavioral, neurobiological, and physiologic health. Emerging literature suggests that stress biomarkers, such as cortisol, C-reactive protein (CRP), and body mass index (BMI) increase when healthy sleep habits are not regularly practiced among older children and adults. These biomarkers are associated with stress and increased risk for future disease. Researchers suggest that young children from racial/ethnic minority groups and/or living with socioeconomic adversity are especially vulnerable to poor sleep beginning within the first year of life. However, little is known about the relationships among sleep characteristics, stress, and health among very young children living with adversity. The proposed study will address this important scientific gap. This study will improve our understanding of these relationships during a critical developmental period in children's lives – toddlerhood. Using a longitudinal design with repeated measures to prospectively examine the relationships among sleep characteristics, stress, and toddler's health from age 12 months to 24 months, we will address the following aims: 1. Examine changes in subjective and objective sleep characteristics from 12 to 24 months of age; 2. Examine changes in stress biomarkers from 12 to 24 months of age; 3. Examine the cross sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep characteristics and stress response; 4. Examine the cross sectional and longitudinal relationships between sleep characteristics and toddlers' behavioral health. The sample will include 113 toddlers who live in socioeconomically disadvantaged homes. Data will be collected during at two time points (age 12 months and 24 months). Data on sleep characteristics will include subjective and objective measures of sleep duration and efficiency, obtained with questionnaires, diaries, and 9 days/nights of sleep actigraphy. Multi-systemic biomarkers of stress including cortisol, C-reactive protein, S-IgA, and BMI, will be measured individually and then explored as a latent variable of stress. Caregiver-reported behavioral health problems will be measured as it is closely associated with children's present and future health. Indicators of economic, environmental, and psychological adversity will be obtained and their relationships with primary variables will be explored. Generalized linear models will be used in the data analysis. Data from this study will be used to support future R-series grant applications designed to further understand the relationships among sleep, stress, and health by following these children over time with additional measures of stress and health to identify causal pathways and ultimately test the effects of interventions, such as those that may improve sleep, among young children at risk for toxic stress. While my past clinical and research experience focused on interventions to support parent- child relationships among families living with adversity, the next step in my career development is to acquire training to understand behavioral and biological aspects of sleep and stress and to explore the extent to which healthy sleep buffers toddlers' stress response to chronic stress early in life. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE The experience of socioeconomic adversity is a chronic stressor that may result in poor sleep, including shortened sleep duration and poor sleep efficiency beginning early in life. The occurrence of poor sleep early during critical developmental periods, such as toddlerhood, may interfere with the young children's ability to maintain homeostasis within their stress response system and compound their risk for stress-related health problems. The proposed training plan and research study will focus on understanding the longitudinal relationships among sleep, multiple biomarkers of stress, and health among toddlers living in socioeconomically disadvantaged homes.","Sleep, Biological Stress, and Health among Toddlers Living in Socioeconomically Disadvantaged Homes",9526543,K23NR016277,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biology ', ' Buffers ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Behavior ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Habits ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Secretory Immunoglobulin A ', ' Secretory IgA ', ' SIgA ', ' Exocrine IgA ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Poverty ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Sleep ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' research study ', ' Toddler ', ' Reporting ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' career development ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' actigraphy ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' prospective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' intervention effect ', ' longitudinal design ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' economic indicator ', ' sleep health ', ' Child Health ', ' early life adversity ', ' ']",NINR,YALE UNIVERSITY,K23,2018,152194,0.04432768022506743
"Improving maternal and child health through prenatal fatty acid supplementation: A randomized controlled study in African American women living in low-income urban environments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnant women living in poverty often experience chronic stress and consequently higher levels of stress hormones. In utero exposure to high levels of stress hormones can negatively affect the developing fetus and the infant's capacity for emotion and behavioral regulation. In this application we describe a developing program of research designed to reduce the negative impact of prenatal stress on infant health and development via nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy. DHA is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member of the omega-3 fatty acid family. DHA is found in its highest concentrations in neural cell membranes, affecting receptor function, neurotransmitter uptake, and signal transmission. There is growing evidence that low levels of dietary DHA intake are associated with suboptimal response to stress and that DHA supplementation can modulate stress response. Aims: The goals of the proposed study are to test whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy is associated with 1) improved maternal health during pregnancy among African American women living in urban poverty; 2) improved infant birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and 3) whether the association between DHA supplementation during pregnancy and infant outcomes is partially mediated by reductions in maternal perceived stress and stress reactivity during pregnancy. Approach: One hundred sixty-two pregnant African American women living in urban poverty, who consume less than two servings of fish per week, will be randomly assigned to receive 450 mg/daily of DHA or placebo beginning at 9-12 weeks of gestation through the end of pregnancy. Perceived stress, stressful life events, anxiety, and depression, inflammatory markers, DHA levels and response to a laboratory stressor will be assessed at baseline and at 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes (e.g., gestational age, birth weight, delivery complications) will be collected from medical records, and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress reactivity will be assessed at 1, 4 and 9 months of age. Investigators: This application builds on a recently completed NICHD/NIMH funded R21 (PI: Keenan), which yielded preliminary evidence that DHA supplementation during pregnancy reduces perceived stress and cortisol response to stress in pregnant African American women living in low-income, urban environments. Drs. Keenan and Hipwell and Ms. Wroblewksi were investigators on the R21 and will continue to work together on the proposed study. Dr. Della Torre is an Assistant Professor of Obstetrics at the University of Chicago, who specializes in providing clinical services to African American women living in the south side of Chicago. Innovation: This will be the first large randomized controlled study of the effect of DHA supplementation in pregnant African American women living in urban poverty on maternal and infant health and stress response. Impact: If DHA supplementation is associated with reductions in perceived stress, more modulated maternal cortisol response to stress, and more optimal emotional and behavioral regulation in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program of research on the mechanisms by which these associations evolve can be launched and broad-based prevention interventions that target maternal and child in vulnerable populations can be implemented, potentially leading to reductions health disparities in the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of the effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in pregnant women living in urban, low-income environments on stress regulation during pregnancy. If essential fatty acid supplementation is associated with reductions in the experience of stress, more modulated biological response to stress, and more optimal stress regulation and neurodevelopment in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program on the mechanisms by which nutrition reduces the negative impact on prenatal stress on the offspring can be launched.

"Longevity and Stress in African American Families Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this application is to identify patterns of perceived stress, active coping style, health status and genes that contribute to longevity observed within African American families. We will examine these factors using vertical and horizontal approaches by studying similarities between siblings and parent-child pairs. To this end, we have the following questions:  1) Do familial effects (genes and shared environments) create similarity in the patterns of perceived tress and coping within and across generations?  2) Does stress account for differences in patterns of longevity between families?  3) Do psychosocial factors like stress, coping, and discrimination account for differences in patterns of health status and longevity between families?  4) What role do genes play in patterns of stress and longevity?  5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? To address these research questions, we have planned five specific aims: 1) Collect data from 750 older African Americans on perceptions of stress, discrimination, coping style, health, personality and genetics from multi-generation families (parent-child and siblings). 2) Examine similarities and differences in stress and coping, and health status among sibling pairs and across generations within families. 3) Compare the health status of siblings concordant for higher stress and poorer coping to those with lower stress and better coping. 4) Examine genes associated with stress and longevity in comparisons of long lived families and short lived families and among sibling pairs. 5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? This project is novel and innovative in that it will employ a multi method approach to understand longevity.

"Racial Disparities in Health: The Roles of Stress, Social Relations and the Cardiovascular System Hypertension is the number one cause of racial group disparities in mortality in the U.S. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which race is linked with the cardiovascular system is key. African Americans (AA) are exposed to more stress across the lifespan and lifetime adversity is associated with cardiovascular disease (CHD) and hypertension. However, mechanisms accounting for the links between long-term stress exposure, hypertension and CHD remain unclear. Cardiovascular reactivity is hypothesized to be a major contender as it predicts increased risk of cardiac events and mortality, especially among people with hypertension. According to existing theories of racial health disparities, stress, and social relations, racial health disparities are due to variations in long-term exposure to stress and stress reactivity (biological, psychological, behavioral) and those race differences are moderated by social relations and age. In response to the FOA Aging Research on Stress and Resilience to Address Health Disparities in the United States (RFA-AG-16-022), the present study seeks to understand how long-term stress exposure links with stress reactivity among AA and EA adults. This study capitalizes the existing longitudinal Social Relations and Health Study (SRS),a regionally representative panel sample of AA and EA individuals from the Detroit metropolitan area who began participating in 1992 (ages 13 to 93) and completed the third wave in 2015 (ages 30 to 95). The proposed study will incorporates two new studies of short-term stress reactivity: 1) a daily stress study and 2) a laboratory stress study. The daily stress study will target 300 participants (50% AA; 50%EA) and will incorporate a 4 day experience sampling study of self-reported stress exposure and reactivity (psychological, behavioral) as well as two ambulatory monitoring devices to assess biological reactivity: 1) a newly developed non-invasive continuous monitoring ring device that provides estimates of vascular resistance and 2) a watch that assesses heart rate, heart rate variability, and galvanic skin response. In the laboratory study we will examine reactivity to standard laboratory stressors among a sample of 50 AA and 50 EA respondents who completed the daily stress study to examine more thoroughly their physiological responses to stress with the same ambulatory ring and watch as well as established continuous monitors. The proposed research addresses three aims: 1) Test links between long- term stress exposure and short-term stress reactivity among EA and AA adults, 2) Examine age differences in long-term stress exposure and short-term reactivity by race, and 3) Determine how long-term social relationships moderate individual differences in stress exposure and reactivity. This project has public health significance as it will identify individuals who are more reactive to stress and the immediate as well as lifespan factors that are associated with greater stress reactivity. A more nuanced understanding of the psychological and biological implications of stress among diverse populations will lead to the development and testing of interventions for reducing stress, later health problems, and health disparities. Project Narrative African Americans are more likely to develop hypertension and to die from hypertension than European Americans. This project seeks to understand how long term pattern of stress, social ties, and hypertension contribute to variations in stress exposure and stress reactivity in daily life. The project is particularly significant for public health as identifying individuals who are more reactive to stress may allow for the development of interventions targeting specific populations of individuals who are more at risk of further health problems and mortality.","Racial Disparities in Health: The Roles of Stress, Social Relations and the Cardiovascular System",9519806,R01AG054371,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' biogerontology ', ' Gerontology ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Outpatient Monitoring ', ' Ambulatory Monitoring ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' stressor ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Devices ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' heart rate variability ', ' stress reactivity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2018,732975,0.19699063878168138
"Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women are disproportionately affected by systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and also face worse consequences of disease activity. This proposed study is important to helping improve our understanding of how psychosocial stressors that are salient in the lives of African American women, and in particular experiences of racial discrimination, exacerbate SLE severity and progression. Accomplishing the specific aims of this research will help to unravel factors contributing to racial disparities in this understudied disease, and will also help to identify potential targets of intervention?",Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women,9418543,R01AR065493,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Linear Models ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Spottings ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' chronic autoimmune disease ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' Lupus ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' psychobiological ', ' psychobiologic ', ' public health relevance ', ' minimally invasive ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' longitudinal design ', ' social health determinants ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' young woman ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' racial identity ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIAMS,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R01,2018,46158,0.07630552075158208
"Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women Project Summary Significance: Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian/gay and bisexual (LGB) women report higher rates of physical health problems. Current evidence, which is largely based on self-report, suggests that important health disparities exist in conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). To date, however, no study has tested differences in objective measures of health risks between LGB and heterosexual women in a representative sample of young adults. We aim to fill this gap by examining putative health disparities using rigorous objective biomarkers of health (i.e. cardiometabolic functioning and inflammation) in young adulthood in a representative, racially diverse sample of young women who are participating in an ongoing longitudinal study, the Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS) (Aim 1). We will link prospectively gathered data on discrimination stress and childhood adversity to determine the role of stress exposure in the association between sexual minority status and early adult health (Aim 2). Finally, we will test whether health promotion during adolescence attenuates the association between discrimination stress and health risks among LGB women (Aim 3). Approach: Our plan is to leverage comprehensive, prospectively collected data from the PGS and measure current health indicators among LGB women in the PGS (n=230) and a demographic frequency matched sample of heterosexual women (n=230) in early adulthood (ages 22-25 years). Assessments of health will include: waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, cholesterol, fatty acids, glucose, insulin, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6; TNF-α), and C-reactive protein. We propose to assess discrimination stress via cortisol and heart rate reactivity to a lab- based discrimination stressor and perceived discrimination experiences measured annually and prospectively from ages 15 to 21 years. Childhood adversity (family stress, trauma, abuse, and peer victimization) has been assessed annually for in the PGS from youth and caregiver reports. Physical and emotional health promotion during adolescence has been assessed in a number of ways in the PGS including vaccine uptake, safe sexual practices, and physical activity, supportive adult presence, and will be complemented by interviews on school climate and coming out experiences. Investigators: Dr. Kathryn Keenan is the Principal Investigator, Drs. Alison Hipwell, Stephanie Stepp, Karen Matthews, Alicia Matthews and Alida Bouris are Co-Investigators, and Ms. Kristen Wroblewski is the biostatistician. Dr. Constance Hammen is the consultant. The investigators have led many successful NIH-funded studies and represent expertise in developmental psychopathology, women's mental health, sexual minority physical and mental health, health psychology, and biostatistics. Collectively, the investigators have experience in administering the TSST to vulnerable populations, measuring cortisol reactivity, and testing hypotheses involving cardiometabolic and inflammatory functioning. Environment: This proposal builds on long-standing, productive collaborations among investigators at the Universities of Chicago, Illinois, and Pittsburgh. Innovation/Impact: The proposed study provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore health disparities in LGB women in a rigorous manner, examine potential mechanisms by which sexual orientation confers health risks, and identify protective factors in a representative and racially diverse sample of LGB and heterosexual women. Project Narrative The goals of the proposed study are to test whether LGB women differ significantly from heterosexual women on objective biomarkers of health and identify mechanisms by which sexual minority women are at heightened risk for compromised health. It is hypothesized that discrimination stress and childhood stressors have adverse effects on metabolic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular systems that maintain health. The proposal also aims to identify health promotion behaviors that mitigate these associations to inform tailored preventive and intervention approaches for at-risk women.",Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women,9442855,R01HL137246,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chicago ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Illinois ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lipids ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Morbidity -

"Stress and Unintended Pregnancy in Adolescence and Young Adulthood ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adolescent and young adult women in the U.S., especially racial/ethnic minority and poor young women, have high rates of early and unintended pregnancy, which are associated with a host of adverse outcomes. While proximal and distal determinants of fertility have been widely studied, little research has focused on the role of stress in unintended pregnancy.  Stress is a leading contributor to morbidity and mortality and a key mechanism that links social context and health disparities. The biological and psychological processes of stress may affect the pathways to unintended pregnancy, but this has not been addressed in reproductive health research. Moreover, how social determinants of stress shape young women's risk of unintended pregnancy is unknown. To improve our knowledge of the complex, interrelated determinants of unintended pregnancy and to advance reproductive health scholarship at the intersection of biological and social processes (i.e. biosocial), this K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award focuses on the important but understudied role of stress in unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood. So that I may conduct cutting-edge research in this area, I propose career development training to: 1) learn sociological theories, concepts, and methods for studying unintended pregnancy and stress; 2) build competency in bio demographic research methods and their application to fertility research; 3) attain a more nuanced understanding of the theory and research on the biology of stress and fecund ability; and 4) become proficient in advanced multilevel, longitudinal, and mediational statistical methods required for modeling the life course of and pathways between stress and unintended pregnancy. The corresponding K01 research project will: 1) estimate how trajectories of stress relate to unintended pregnancy; 2) investigate relationships between social determinants of stress (social stressors), stress trajectories, and unintended pregnancy; and 3) explore the biological processes (e.g., neuroendocrine, inflammatory, and immune) through which stress influences unintended pregnancy, during adolescence and young adulthood. To assist with the K01 training and research plans, I have assembled a strong multidisciplinary advisory board comprised of esteemed scholars, including mentor Jennifer Barber PhD, co-mentor Kathleen Mullan Harris PhD, scientific advisors Ana Diez Roux MD PhD, Timothy Johnson MD, and Julia Seng PhD MSN, and statistical consultant Yu Xie PhD. The University of Michigan Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Institute for Social Research and The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health and Carolina Population Center will provide the infrastructures to support these activities. This K01 will establish me as an independent investigator poised to conduct new biosocial studies of fertility and ultimately lead innovative, interdisciplinary research efforts to improve outcomes an reduce disparities in young women's reproductive health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood is a persistent public health problem with negative implications for young women, their offspring, and society. Stress, which is prevalent across the reproductive life course and is a contributor to morbidity, mortality, and health disparities, has been understudied in reproductive health research. Using an innovative, comprehensive, and interdisciplinary approach, this study will provide new insights into the biosocial processes of stress that shape the risk of unintended pregnancy during adolescence and young adulthood, and findings will help identify reproductive health services, programs, and policies to improve reproductive outcomes and reduce disparities among young women.",Stress and Unintended Pregnancy in Adolescence and Young Adulthood,9491596,K01HD080722,"['Spontaneous abortion ', ' Miscarriage ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Affect ', ' Award ', ' Barbering ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Biology ', ' Family Planning ', ' Family Planning Services ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Economics ', ' Fertility ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Gynecology ', ' Hazard Models ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Learning ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity -

"Stress and the Genome: Testing the Impact of Social Effects on Gene Regulation Project Summary  The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and well being. Chronic social stress and reduced access to social support are strongly linked to major diseases of aging; as a result, social adversity is highly predictive of life expectancy itself. Recent evidence suggests that, while some of this relationship is explained by correlated factors such as smoking, obesity, and health care access, social stressors also have a direct impact on physiological function. Indeed, work in animal models has clearly demonstrated that the experience of social subordination alone can alter the function of the immune system, in part by altering gene regulation in immune cells.  The goal of the proposed research is to address a key outstanding question that arises from these findings: when, and for whom, are chronic social stress effects on immune function most important? To do so, it will take advantage of dominance rank in female rhesus macaques as a model for chronic social stressor exposure in humans. Rhesus macaque females are excellent models for human social stress because they naturally organize into dominance rank hierarchies in which low ranking individuals experience increased rates of harassment, reduced social affiliation, and physiological markers of rank-related stress. Importantly, dominance rank assignments, and thus an individual's exposure to social stressors, can be manipulated in this species by manipulating group membership. Such manipulations yield a powerful experimental model for investigating the consequences of socially induced stress—an approach that is directly translatable to humans, but that is practically and ethically impossible in humans themselves.  The proposed study will take advantage of this model to investigate how differential exposure to dominance rank-induced social stress causally influences gene expression in the immune system. Specifically, it will use an in vitro approach to efficiently screen for condition-specific social stress effects on gene expression levels across 30 physiologically relevant environmental conditions (e.g., pathogen exposure, steroid hormone signaling). It will complement the in vitro screen with an in vivo test of the gene regulatory and antibody response to influenza vaccination, a medical procedure in which variable responses are of particular concern as individuals age. Finally, it will test whether age, social behavior, and genotype can be used to predict interindividual variation in the strength of social stressor effects on immune regulation, and hence which individuals are most vulnerable. Together, the proposed analyses will provide much-needed insight into the factors that explain when and why individuals differ in their response to the same social stressors, as well as the potential consequences of these differences for medical treatment. The project's results will therefore have direct translational application to both identifying the most susceptible members of our aging population and suggesting tailored strategies for intervention. Project Narrative The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and wellbeing, with particularly strong predictive power for diseases of aging and mortality risk itself. This project uses a nonhuman primate model for human social stress, the rhesus macaque, to investigate the factors that explain interindividual variation in the impact of social stress on the genome, including the conditions under which these effects are most important. The results of this project will contribute to understanding how social stress influences disease susceptibility and how to identify those who are most vulnerable to its negative effects.",Stress and

"Health disparities, stress pathways, and stress-related comorbidities among MSM living with HIV Project Summary Stress is associated with HIV risk behaviors, immune dysregulation, and among people living with HIV (PLWH) it has been associated with viral load and disease progression. The goal of this study is to better understand the mechanisms of stress and stress-related comorbidities and how they exacerbate HIV-related health disparities among HIV-infected Black men who have sex with men (BMSM). Studies in many parts of the US suggest that BMSM often live or spend much of their time in impoverished neighborhoods where physical and social disorders (e.g., physical decay, violence, discrimination) are clustered. These socio-structural factors can be conceptualized as chronic and acute stressors and may promote other stressors that lead to HIV-related outcomes. While much of the literature on minority stress has focused on major discriminatory events, this proposed study will examine microaggressions. We will comprehensively assess chronic, acute, and daily psychosocial stressors that are particularly relevant to MSM, especially BMSM. Moreover, we will use measures of hypothalamic–pituitary– adrenal (HPA) axis responses, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and inflammatory biomarkers to identify specific stress pathways among HIV-infected BMSM and White MSM (WMSM) that can be targeted in future interventions. We aim to provide an extension of minority stress theory by utilizing intensive longitudinal protocols to assess daily discriminatory events and other stressors, and to explore the association with HIV-related behaviors and physiological outcomes. Built upon the evidence of feasibility and acceptability from our previous research, this aim will be accomplished by using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of stressors and stress, Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), and home-based testing for cortisol. We propose a longitudinal study of 450 HIV-infected BMSM and WMSM who have common stress-related comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, depression, substance abuse) assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Participants will provide 9 days of smartphone- based EMA and MEMS for ART medication adherence every 6 months for 24 months. Every 6 months, we will collect stress and immune function biomarkers. Relevance The proposed research will enhance the effectiveness of future interventions by increasing our understanding of MSM health disparities and which modifiable stressors are most strongly associated with the health of MSM, the context in which these stressors lead to HIV-related behaviors, and how resilience and specific types of social network support may have buffering and direct effects on well-being.","Health disparities, stress pathways, and stress-related comorbidities among MSM living with HIV",9651006,R01MD013495,"['Adrenal Glands ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', '

"Biomarkers of Health Risk Among African American Couples ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation (INF) predicts the onset of chronic, age-related diseases. Although psychosocial stress is a major determinant of INF, we know little about the role of stress contagion from romantic partners, a prominent social context in early adulthood, or the role of childhood stressors in amplifying INF response to adult stress. Evidence has accumulated indicating that early stress experiences may shift propensity to respond with INF due to early calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR). However, we have little information regarding the extent to which IRTR predicts amplified INF response to adult stressors or the extent which it accounts for the impact of early stressors on INF. In addition, we do not know the extent to which persistent, supportive relationships in young adulthood have the potential to ameliorate the impact of earlier stressors by modifying IRTR and so reducing INF in response to adult stressors. Finally, prior research has largely focused on White samples, thereby limiting our understanding of the causes of INF among African Americans, a group at elevated risk for age- related chronic illness. This application seeks funding to add assessment of romantic partners and to directly assess IRTR for both targets and partners who are participating in a recently funded application. In the parent application we assess INF and collect telephone interview data from targets regarding stress and health behaviors in a sample of roughly 700 African Americans (now 28 years of age). In the current application we add parallel interview assessments and assessment of INF for N = 320 romantic partners. In addition we add assessment of IRTR for both targets and romantic partners. This additional data collection will allow us to address the following specific aims: 1) Identify the effect of stress contagion on young adult INF among African Americans, controlling for own stressors and history of early exposure to stressors; 2) Test hypothesized amplification of effect on INF of own stress, stress contagion, and dyad-level effects due to exposure to early stressors, and examine the hypothesis that calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR) is the mechanism by which early stress influences INF; and 3) Test the hypothesized role of persistent supportive romantic relationships (PSR) in ""recalibrating"" stress biology, i.e., examine the hypothesis that among those in persistent supportive relationships in young adulthood we will see reduced impact of early stress exposure on IRTR. The Institute of Medicine prescribes development of prevention based on longitudinal, epidemiological research with target populations. Currently, no prospective investigations identify the protective factors that interrup the impact of stress on INF for African Americans. The results of the proposed research will identify protective processes and serve as the basis for empirically- based, health disparities prevention programs as well as provide a basis for ongoing policy discussions, e.g. the Healthy Marriage Initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving quality of longer lives requires information about sources of the inflammation linked to age- related, chronic diseases; causes that include social relationships and may lie at earlier stages of development. Building on prior research documenting the role of childhood stress in amplifying inflammatory responses to adult stress, the present study examines the interaction of child stress with stress contagion from adult romantic partners as well as ameliorative effects due to persistent, supportive romantic relationships, and so provides a foundation for development of preventative interventions to protect against amplified inflammation and a framework for ongoing policy discussions such as the healthy marriage initiative.",Biomarkers of Health Risk Among African American Couples,9463366,R01HD080749,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Literature ', ' Marriage ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Failure ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' contagion ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' healthy aging ', ' parent project ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' predicting response ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2018,525107,0.20612964275731316
"Prenatal Pollution, Stress and Maternal-child Health: Role of Immunomodulation DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The goal of this Career Development Plan is to launch an independent research career in children's environmental health, specializing in climate change research, with a focus on the health vulnerabilities of children. Climate change will impact health by changing the landscape with respect to allergens, pollution, extreme storms, and thermal stress. The health care community can best reduce the burden of climate change on health through targeted interventions for specific vulnerabilities. Research on these vulnerabilities requires advanced epidemiologic skills. This Career Development Plan will build on the candidate's formal training in pediatrics to obtain the background in environmental epidemiology needed to develop hypotheses and design environmental health studies that are well-grounded in biological mechanisms of toxicity. This plan incorporates didactic training in environmental epidemiology and complex statistical techniques. The research component builds on a dual-site prenatal cohort recruited in Boston and New York: the Programming of Intergenerational Stress Mechanisms (PRISM) study. The research will examine the role of prenatal air pollution, psychosocial stress, and immune mechanisms in maternal-child health. The candidate is an Assistant Professor in the Departments of Preventive Medicine and Pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, a nationally and internationally recognized center of excellence in preventive medicine, occupational and environmental medicine, community health, and environmental pediatrics. An interdisciplinary mentorship team has been selected to provide guidance and expertise in environmental epidemiology, psychosocial stress, immunology, and psychiatry. The proposed training and research program will position the candidate to work effectively with a number of active, multidisciplinary groups at the completion of the award period. The project is guided by the following career objectives: 1) to gain knowledge on diverse methods of spatial modeling for social and physical environmental exposure assessment; 2) to gain experience working with observed and modeled climate data, in particular, downscaled climate model outputs; 3) to develop expertise in advanced statistical methods relevant to climate and health work specifically focusing on air pollution, stress, and inflammatory biomarkers; 4) to acquire familiarity with additional climate-sensitive outcomes such as birth and mental health outcomes and mechanistic intermediaries. This career development plan will facilitate the candidate becoming a leading expert and independent investigator in children's environmental health and advance the NIH's mission to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability. Public Health Relevance: Climate change is estimated to result in over 200,000 premature deaths per year - over 80% of which are among children - and projected to cause additional health effects in the coming decades. Air pollution and psychosocial stress exposures, and the underlying immune mechanisms of maternal and child health are important climate-sensitive factors in this public health issue. This project aims to build the epidemiologic skills of a pediatrician dedicated to finding ways to reduce climate health impacts both within the USA and globally.","Prenatal Pollution, Stress and

"Interaction of Air Pollution and Psychosocial Stress on Cardiovascular Disease. DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         This proposal seeks to understand the interaction between air pollution and psychosocial stress on markers of inflammation and subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). Under the mentorship of Dr. Joel Kaufman, this training and research plan will build upon Dr. Hajat's expertise in social epidemiology and prepare her for a career studying the nexus of social and environmental factors and their impact on CVD. During the K99 phase, Dr. Hajat will use didactic instruction and independent study to gain additional training in 1) the biology of stress and CVD 2) spatial statistical methods and 3) exposure generation and assessment. This training will provide Dr. Hajat with interdisciplinary skills and knowledge as she moves towards an independent research career. During the K99 phase Dr. Hajat will characterize the extent to which biomarkers of stress, neighborhood-level psychosocial stressors and individual level psychosocial stressors are spatially correlated with ambient air pollutants, specifically particulae matter <2.5 �m in aerodynamic diameter, nitrogen dioxide, oxides of nitrogen and black carbon. This work will build upon Dr. Hajat's previous work using the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), a longitudinal study of subclinical CVD in a cohort of older adults recruited from six metropolitan areas across the US. Upon completion of the training phase of this award, Dr. Hajat will undertake research during the R00 phase of the project that will transition her to an independent investigator. The aims of this research are (1) to assess the synergistic effects of air pollution and psychosocial stress (measured objectively and subjectively) on markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen) as well as on the progression of atherosclerosis in different vascular beds, measured by intima media thickness, coronary calcification and ankle brachial index and (2) to conduct a crossover study which exposes participants to both diesel exhaust (DE) from an inhalation facility and a laboratory-based mental stress test to assess the synergistic effect of both exposures on physiological outcomes such as blood pressure, heart rate variability, catecholamine levels and IL-6. The research in the R00 phase proposes epidemiologic studies of two complementary extant data sources, MESA and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a cross-sectional nationally representative sample of the US population. Both studies have data on air pollution, psychosocial stressors, inflammation and subclinical CVD and together capture a larger geographic area and populations across the life course. The R00 phase also proposes conducting an experimental study. The study will be conducted in one of the nation's few controlled inhalation facilities where subjects will be exposed to both DE and a laboratory generated acute mental stressor. The acute mental stress exposure, which is often used in psychology, will consist of administering a speech task and an arithmetic task. Understanding the synergistic effects of air pollution and psychosocial stress will help advance our understanding of the biological mechanisms behind environmental health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic and socioeconomic inequalities in rates of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the US, have been persistent for decades. New approaches to understanding the root causes of health disparities are needed if our nation wants to make progress towards alleviating these disparities and in so doing improving the public's health. This proposal will explore the joint effect of psychosocial stressors and an environmental hazard, air pollution, to better understand if together these factors contribute to precursors of

"Addressing Provider Stress and Unconscious Bias to Improve Quality of Maternal Health Care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will facilitate my transition to an independent scientist who conducts innovative research on the social, structural, and health system drivers of maternal and child health (MCH) disparities, and translates the findings into practical interventions that will reduce disparities and improve MCH outcomes. The activities described in this proposal are aimed at addressing health care provider stress and unconscious bias to improve quality of maternal health care, particularly the person-centered dimensions. Poor person-centered maternal health care (PCMHC) contributes to high maternal and neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and disparities in PCMHC are driving disparities in use of maternal health services. Little research, however, exists on how to improve PCMHC and reduce disparities. I seek to fill this gap with this project. I propose targeting health provider stress and unconscious bias as fundamental factors driving poor PCMHC and disparities in PCMHC. Health provider stress and unconscious bias are important to consider because: (1) providers in low-resource settings often work under very stressful conditions; (2) unconscious bias is prevalent in every society including SSA; and (3) these factors are mutually reinforcing drivers of poor quality care and disparities in person-centered care. To prepare me to develop my unique research program and extend the evidence base on interventions to improve PCMHC, I propose training and research during the mentored phase (K99) to extend my knowledge and skills in: (1) stress and unconscious bias; (2) advanced qualitative and mixed methods research; and (3) implementation science methodology. In the K99 phase, I will also conduct (1) multilevel secondary data analysis to examine individual level characteristics and potential system level stressors associated with PCMHC, focusing on the role of provider stress; and (2) structured and in-depth interviews with providers to examine the levels of provider stress and unconscious bias, and the types of stressors and biases in Kenya. The knowledge and skills gained in the mentored phase, as well as the results of the mentored research, will be instrumental to achieving the aims of the independent phase (R00), which are to: (1) design a multicomponent theory and evidence-based intervention that enables providers to identify and manage their stress and unconscious bias; (2) pilot the intervention to assess its feasibility and acceptability; and (3) assess preliminary effect of the intervention on: (a) provider knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to stress and unconscious bias; and (b) provider stress levels—using a pretest-posttest control group design. I will use the results of the pilot to refine the intervention and develop an R01 proposal for a multi-site evaluation with a larger sample and longer follow up, to assess impact on PCMHC. My mentorship and consulting team is uniquely poised to assist me in achieving my training and research goals, and to ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Of the estimated 800 pregnancy-related deaths that occur daily, about two-thirds occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and for every woman who dies, about 20 others suffer various disabilities. Poor person-centered maternal health care (PCMHC) contributes directly to high maternal mortality and morbidity, and indirectly through decreased demand for health services. This K99/R00 application proposes training and research to develop expertise in stress and unconscious bias, advanced qualitative and mixed methods research, and implementation science methodology to inform the design, piloting, and evaluation of an intervention that targets provider stress and unconscious bias to improve PCMHC.",Addressing Provider Stress and Unconscious Bias to Improve Quality of Maternal Health Care,9598299,K99HD093798,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Africa South of the Sahara ', ' Subsaharan Africa ', ' Sub-Saharan Africa ', ' Attention ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Consultations ', ' Control Groups ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Services ', ' Interview ', ' Kenya ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leadership ', ' Learning ', ' Maternal Health ', ' Maternal Health Services ', ' mother health care ', ' Maternal Mortality ', ' maternal death ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' newborn mortality ', ' newborn death ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' Patients ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Translating ', ' Unconscious State ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Process Measure ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Trainers Training ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' Consult ', ' Services ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Childbirth ', ' child birth ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' Maternal and Child Health ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Trauma ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' person centered ', ' stem ', ' implementation science ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' social learning theory ', ' social cognitive theory ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' intervention effect ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' maternal morbidity ', ' unconscious bias ', ' LMIC ', ' low and middle-income countries ', ' neonatal outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' ']",NICHD,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",K99,2018,131647,0.09565883386348671
"Testing a Biopsychosocial Model of Minority Stress and Health for HIV-Positive Men Project Summary Gay and bisexual men (GBM) in the U.S. are burdened by a high and disproportionate rate of HIV infection and more than half of all HIV+ individuals are GBM. Improving viral load (VL) suppression is associated with a significant reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV. Moreover, research is needed to better understand the modifiable social and behavioral factors that influence their long-term health. Chronic experiences of sexual minority stressors (e.g., internalized homonegativity) have been shown to influence a variety of mental, behavioral, and physical health outcomes for GBM, including general stress (e.g., cortisol) and immune (e.g., cytokines) outcomes, as well as HIV-specific health outcomes (e.g., CD4 count) among HIV+ GBM. Chronic experiences of HIV-related stressors have also been shown to impact mental health and health behaviors for HIV+ GBM, though there is substantially less research on their role in the health of HIV+ GBM. Previous research, including our own, has shown that fluctuations in sexual minority and HIV-specific stressors (i.e., acute experiences of these stressors) are measurable and meaningfully associated with health outcomes. Both HIV infection and substance use are associated with declines in neurocognitive function and emerging evidence suggests that emotional processing may help explain the impact of psychological phenomena on health outcomes. To develop interventions that are robust and durable, research is needed that examines the unique and overlapping influence of sexual minority and HIV-related stressors on health outcomes for HIV+ GBM within a unified biopsychosocial model. Such a model should take into account both individual-level (i.e., chronic) and situational (i.e., acute) experiences of these stressors to examine their independent associations with health, and should consider whether emotional interference in cognitive processing might moderate these associations. Aim 1 of the study is to test a biopsychosocial model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress and health, examining direct and indirect effects of these stressors on each outcome. Aim 2 is to test the moderating role of emotional interference in cognitive processing on these associations. Finally, Aim 3 is to examine the extent of intraindividual variability over one year in sexual minority and HIV-related stressors, VL, CD4, and cytokines. Although not an aim, the study will culminate in the development of guidelines for future intervention development and we will gather participant feedback on these recommendations. To accomplish these aims, we will enroll 250 HIV+ GBM and follow them for 12 months. We will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over one year to test the impact of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on physiological stress (diurnal cortisol) and long-term immune outcomes (VL suppression, CD4 count, cytokines). This study will address novel questions about the relative role of sexual minority and HIV-related stress in the health of HIV+ GBM to guide the development of interventions to improve health and reduce HIV transmission, morbidity, and mortality among HIV+ GBM. Project Narrative Sexual minority stress is an established contributor to poorer behavioral, mental, and physical health for gay and bisexual men, though the role of HIV-related stress within these models has gone largely unexplored. We will test a unified model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on biomarkers of physiological stress (i.e., cortisol) and immune (i.e., viral load, CD4, cytokines) responses using twice-daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over 12 months to prospectively test the proposed model. We will use self-reported surveys and neurocognitive assessments to quantitatively examine the impact of these stressors on HIV-related health outcomes, and end by developing guidelines to inform the development of future interventions aimed at improving HIV treatment and prevent HIV transmission.",Testing a Biopsychosocial Model of Minority Stress and Health for HIV-Positive Men,9634332,R01MH114735,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', "" Men's Role "", ' role men ', ' male role ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Morbidity -

"An Interpersonal Relationships Intervention for Improving Cardiovascular Health in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY Disparities in cardiovascular (CV) diseases by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity are pronounced in our society, and the processes that lead to these disparities begin in childhood. Previous intervention efforts have targeted individual lifestyle changes in health behaviors, but with limited success in low SES, minority youth. We propose a novel intervention to reduce CV risk in low SES, minority children (under 21 by NIH guidelines) that focuses on social relationships – specifically mentoring – as a way to create bi-directional benefits for CV health in youth. The rationale for this intervention is based both on work showing that receiving social support has benefits for physical health, and on work demonstrating that helping others is associated with better physical health. In this proposed intervention study, college students will serve as mentors to elementary school students (8th graders). 250 college students and 250 Chicago Public School 8th graders will be randomized to either serve as a mentor/mentee or to be in a control group. Students will participate in a weekly mentoring intervention throughout one school year. Assessments will occur at 3 time points during the school year. All mentors and mentees will come from low-income families and underrepresented minority groups, thus allowing us to focus on improving CV health in an at-risk population that experiences a disproportionate share of the CV burden in the U.S. The first aim of the project is to investigate whether mentors can reduce CV risk (obesity; blood pressure; cholesterol; blood glucose) in low-income, minority youth mentees relative to a control group of 8th graders. The second aim is to investigate whether serving as a mentor can reduce CV risk in the college student mentors compared to a control group of college students. The third aim is to understand how mentoring influences the intervention targets of psychosocial, health behavior, and biological variables, and whether these variables mediate the impact of mentoring on CV health. Drawing from the stress buffering model of social support, we propose that mentoring fosters the development of strong social relationships that can scaffold behavioral changes and hence mitigate the effects that stress has on inflammation and CV health via 2 pathways: psychophysiological and health behaviors. In the psychophysiological pathway, mentoring creates more adaptive cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to life stressors, which in turn mitigate responses of the sympathetic and neuroendocrine systems to stress. Over time, this reduces inflammation and improves CV health. In the health behaviors pathway, the scaffolding from mentoring relationships mitigates the associations of stress with detrimental health behaviors that in turn are linked to both inflammation and CV health. Through this study, we take a social relationships- oriented primary prevention approach to reducing health disparities by targeting CV risk factors that emerge early in life and that predict clinical CV disease outcomes into adulthood and by focusing on low-income, minority mentors and mentees who represent an at-risk, underserved, and disadvantaged group of youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT This project will implement a mentoring intervention pairing low-income minority college students as mentors to low-income minority elementary school students, and investigate the effects of mentoring on the cardiovascular health of both mentees and mentors. From a single intervention, we have the potential to create cardiovascular health benefits among both younger youth (mentees) and older youth (mentors) simultaneously through a novel approach that focuses on the beneficial influences that a social relationship between a mentor and mentee can have in helping to scaffold positive behavioral changes. This project takes a primary prevention approach by focusing on cardiovascular risk factors that emerge during childhood and as well, targets health disparities by focusing on an at-risk group of low-income, minority youth.",An Interpersonal Relationships Intervention for Improving Cardiovascular Health in Youth,9446719,R01HL136676,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ',

"Social Stressors and Inflammation: A Mixed Methods Approach to Preterm Birth African American women have 1.5 times the rates of preterm birth (PTB) (<37 weeks completed gestation) compared with non-Hispanic white women. This disproportionately high PTB rate in African Americans is a persistent health inequity that leads to high child mortality, morbidity, and developmental delays. In the U.S. approximately $26 billion are spent annually on health care costs for infants and children that were born prematurely. Recent attempts to explain the high PTB rates in African American women have focused on social stressors, such as disadvantaged neighborhoods, racial discrimination, and stressful life events. These social stressors may lead to PTB by increasing women’s emotional stress levels. Not surprisingly, emotional stress along with levels of the stress hormone cortisol and systemic inflammation - both physiological responses to stress - have all been related to higher risk of PTB. In contrast, one’s psychosocial resources (e.g., social support) can lessen emotional stress and have protective effects on PTB. Little is yet known about the pathways by which social stressors affect inflammation, and ultimately PTB. The objective of the proposed study is to determine how social stressors alter inflammation during pregnancy and lead to PTB in African American women. We aim to: 1) determine the pathways by which social stressors affect PTB; and 2) describe social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; the associations among these concepts; and their impact on PTB from women’s perspectives.  In this longitudinal convergent mixed methods design, we will enroll 1,500 African American women who live in the Detroit metropolitan area. We will collect data on social stressors, emotional stress, and psychosocial resources through questionnaires and administrative (e.g., census) data. This will be done three times prenatally. At these same time points, levels of cortisol and systemic inflammation will be determined from hair and blood samples, respectively. We will also obtain birth data from the prenatal and hospital records. In a subsample of 60 women, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to more specifically understand the associations among social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; and their impact on PTB. We will conduct a variety of statistical, qualitative and mixed methods analyses using both quantitative and qualitative data to determine answers to the aims of our study. We will also consider the timing of pregnancy in our analyses, as the prenatal data are collected at three distinct time points. The proposed research is highly relevant to NIH’s mission to elucidate mechanisms underlying health disparities in PTB. Insights gained from this mixed methods approach may lead to the development of an individualized PTB risk profile based on a woman's social stressors and biomarkers which will have potential use in clinical practice and be a target for culturally appropriate interventions to reduce PTB incidence in African American women, and will generate new perspectives for future research in other racial groups through our detailed focus on this high risk group. Preterm birth is a major risk for neonatal mortality and long-term child health problems, including motor and mental developmental delays and chronic illness. Knowledge of the social context of African American women’s lives will increase our understanding of why some women have poor pregnancy outcomes, generate new perspectives for future research, inform new lines of inquiry regarding the pathways through which stress affects preterm birth in other racial groups, contribute to the development of culturally appropriate interventions to reduce racial disparities in preterm birth, and ultimately improve birth outcomes.",Social Stressors and Inflammation: A Mixed Methods Approach to Preterm Birth,9410532,R01MD011575,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hospital Records ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Early Life Adversity, Cumulative Life Stress, Race, and Cellular Aging in Midlife Women and Offspring Early Life Adversity, Cumulative Stress, Race, & Cell Aging in Midlife Women & Offspring BACKGROUND: There is an increasingly recognized role of stress in elevating disease risk, especially among women, minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Few prospective studies follow individuals from childhood to adulthood, leaving critical unanswered questions such as which types of adversity, and life periods (childhood, adolescence, adulthood, or cumulative) have the greatest impact on biological aging and can help explain racial differences in health. We have a remarkable opportunity to examine types of lifespan stress in a longitudinal cohort of black and white women who have been followed from 10 years old. We have collected multiple sources of stress, including individual stressors (severe life events, chronic stressors, global perceived stress) and environmental stressors (neighborhood deprivation and violence). Our broad aim is to conduct a novel examination of adversity and links to epigenomic markers (telomere length, epigenetic aging) in women and their children, and to systemic inflammation in the women. These indices of biological aging each serve as a reliable predictor of early disease. We will test how each are associated with stress in childhood and concurrently in midlife. METHOD: We are conducting a 30 year follow up of the prospective NHLBI Growth and Health Study (NGHS), a biracial cohort of children to examine intergenerational transmission of obesity (R01 HD073568). Black and white girls were initially followed prospectively for from 10 to 20 years old and are now being enrolled at 39 years old. Here we propose to assess indices of cellular aging in 590 NGHS women and their most recent (index) child. Retention of sample and adherence to blood and saliva sampling is excellent. We will assess whether lifespan stress is associated with indices of accelerated cellular aging at age 39 (Aim 1) and secondarily whether types of stress (severe events, chronic stressors, global perceptions, neighborhood deprivation) or time-periods (childhood, adolescence, adulthood) have differential or cumulative effects. We will assess whether pregnancy stress or lifespan stress is associated with offspring epigenomic markers (Aim 2), and whether race modifies these effects (Aim 3). Lastly, we will explore whether high resilience (support and self-esteem) buffers the effects of adversity. SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATION: This will be the first prospective study to test lifespan stress predictors of three distinct indices of biological aging, each representing different pathways of aging, in a biracial cohort and to assess stress effects on offspring epigenome. This should advance our understanding of lifespan stress on aging biology. A more granular understanding of the types and timing of stress that impact aging processes is necessary for designing policies and programs that reduce socioeconomic disparities in health and aging. Project Narrative Growing black/white disparities in health across generations has reached a critical juncture, and these differences may be due in part to greater stress exposures, which in turn may accelerate cellular aging processes. This study examines how different types of stress through the lifespan—such as traumatic events and chronic situations, perceptions of global stress, and neighborhood deprivation-- might accelerate aging processes (as indexed by telomere length, epigenetic age, and inflammation) in a longitudinal cohort of biracial girls followed from age 10 and now 39, and whether their stress exposures also predict their offpsrings' biological aging. A better understanding of the types of stress that impact health and intergenerational transmission of risk, as well as the potentially protective effects of psychological resiliency factors such as social support, will help inform the design of policies and programs that reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in premature aging and disease.","Early Life Adversity, Cumulative Life Stress, Race, and Cellular Aging in Midlife Women and Offspring",9781555,R56AG059677,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Animals ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Genome ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Methylation ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Perception ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saliva ', ' Science ', ' self esteem ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Chronic ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Premature Aging ', ' Premature aging syndrome ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' disorder onset ', ' disease onset ', ' Onset of illness ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Genetic Load ', ' psychosocial ', ' environmental stressor ', ' stressor ', ' intergenerational ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' offspring ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Categories ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' social ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' deprivation ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Adherence ', ' Aging-Related Process ', ' Aging Process ', ' Biology of Aging ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' epigenomics ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' protective effect ', ' ten years of age ', ' ten year old ', ' age 10 years ', ' 10 years of age ', ' 10 year old ', ' twenty years of age ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 years of age ', ' 20 year old ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' epigenome ', ' traumatic event ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' biracial ', ' black/white disparity ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' secondary analysis ', ' recruit ', ' early life stress ', ' early life adversity ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R56,2018,689780,0.05614422469933199
"Socioeconomic Disparities in Cognitive and Neural Development in the First 3 years Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is associated with deleterious effects on cognitive development and academic achievement, which in turn have long-lasting ramifications for numerous physical and mental health outcomes across the lifespan. Yet, our understanding of the experiential, physiological, epigenetic and neural pathways through which socioeconomic disparities shape developmental processes is just beginning to emerge. The core contribution of the proposed research would be to further this understanding, by marrying state-of-the-art measurement of brain function, physiology and epigenetics with a sophisticated conceptual and empirical understanding of socioeconomic inequality and experience. In this project, we will investigate how distal factors like SES operate through more proximate factors such as the home language environment and perceived and physiologic stress, and how these proximate factors shape the development of distinct neural and cognitive systems. Two pathways are hypothesized. First, we predict that socioeconomic disparities in the quality and quantity of linguistic stimulation in the home lead to differences in the function of language-specific brain processes, which in turn lead to differences in child language development. Secondly, we predict that SES disparities in perceived stress as well as physiologic stress (cortisol, epigenetics) lead to differences in the function of memory-specific brain processes, which in turn lead to differences in child memory development. To test these hypotheses, a longitudinal study is proposed in which a socioeconomically diverse cohort of 200 children and their families will be followed from birth through age 3. The development of early language and memory skills will be tracked, along with family SES, the home language environment, perceived stress, stress physiology, epigenetics, and brain function. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Examine longitudinally from birth to 3 the relations among SES, language, memory and brain development. (2) Examine whether socioeconomic disparities in cognitive and brain development are mediated by (a) the home language environment and (b) perceived and physiologic stress. This innovative research will elucidate the pathways linking socioeconomic disparities to specific cognitive and neural outcomes. This is aligned with NICHD’s mission to assist children to “achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.” Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is associated with deleterious effects on cognitive development and academic achievement, which in turn have long-lasting ramifications for numerous physical and mental health outcomes. This research will elucidate how the home language environment, perceived stress, stress physiology, epigenetics and brain function shape these associations, from birth through age three. This information will be critical for the design of more precise preventive, screening and interventional strategies to prevent academic failure and ultimately foster healthy development for all children.",Socioeconomic Disparities in Cognitive and Neural Development in the First 3 years,9423543,R01HD093707,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Language ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Distal ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Shapes ', ' Investigation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' American ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Developmental Process ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Preventative screening ', ' Preventive screening ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Coupled ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' cognitive system ', ' Neurocognition ', ' cognitive development ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' retention rate ', ' Attainment Rate ', ' Graduation Rates ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' early life stress ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2018,531706,0.05122155077610686
"Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a lack of research on systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a multisystem, chronic, autoimmune disease that shows clear patterns along racial and gender lines. African American women not only have a greater prevalence of SLE, but also experience greater severity and faster progression compared to their White counterparts, being more frequently affected by organ damage and comorbid conditions that emerge as a consequence of disease activity and disease-related chronic inflammation and tissue damage. Racial disparities in SLE complications and mortality are well documented; however, the reasons for these disparities are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge, this study aims to: (1) examine the role that psychosocial stressors experienced by African American women have in exacerbating SLE in this population; (2) identify social factors and psychological resources that are protective or buffer the effects of stress on SLE-related health declines; and (3) explore the biological implications of psychosocial stressors and SLE, in relation to elevated systemic inflammation and accelerated aging at the cellular level.  The experiences of African American women with SLE are particularly challenging, and include psychosocial stressors related to disease management, as well as disproportionately greater poverty and living in disadvantaged communities; in addition to routine stressors such as those associated with work, family and relationship demands, parenting, and caregiving. Experiences of racial discrimination constitute a qualitatively distinct source of psychosocial stress, adding o existing everyday hassles. In this study, we will examine how these stressors impact SLE severity and progression through a longitudinal study design. We will collect three waves of data from 480 African American women, all with validated SLE. Participants will be recruited from the Georgians Organized Against Lupus (GOAL) cohort, a truly one-of-a-kind, population-based study of SLE in Atlanta, including a full spectrum of patients from all levels of socioeconomic strata, across a range of disease severity. We will examine the effects of racial discrimination, financial and neighborhood-related strains, and other stressors associated with various role strains. Potential protective factors, including those related to racial identity and social suppor will also be assessed. We will collect dried blood spots (DBS), a minimally invasive alternative to venipuncture, to examine indicators of biological dysregulation which we hypothesize will be impacted by psychosocial stress as well as SLE activity. This study will be the most in-depth investigation of the multifactorial nature of psychosocial stressors and their impact on SLE disease progression among African American women, and thus fills an important gap in the science on this understudied disease. This research is important in advancing knowledge of how aspects of the social environment and psychological processes impact health among African American women with SLE, and also contributes to scientific knowledge on the underpinnings of racial disparities in the progression of this disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African American women are disproportionately affected by systematic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and also face worse consequences of disease activity. This proposed study is important to helping improve our understanding of how psychosocial stressors that are salient in the lives of African American women, and in particular experiences of racial discrimination, exacerbate SLE severity and progression. Accomplishing the specific aims of this research will help to unravel factors contributing to racial disparities in this understudied disease, and will also help to identify potential targets of intervention?",Psychosocial Factors and Lupus Disease Progression Among African American Women,9511518,R01AR065493,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Data Collection ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family Relationship ', ' Family Relations ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Inflammation ', ' Kidney ', ' renal ', ' Kidney Urinary System ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Linear Models ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythematosus ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE - Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Systemic Lupus Erythmatosus ', ' SLE ', ' Lupus Erythematosus Disseminatus ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Poverty ', ' Privatization ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Socialization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Sample Size ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Spottings ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Lupus Erythematosus ', ' Investigation ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Venipunctures ', ' Participant ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Psychosocial Assessment and Care ', ' psychosocial support ', ' psychosocial studies ', ' psychosocial care ', ' psychosocial assessment ', ' Data ', ' Disease Pathway ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' chronic autoimmune disease ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' Lupus ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' psychobiological ', ' psychobiologic ', ' public health relevance ', ' minimally invasive ', ' population based ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' longitudinal design ', ' social health determinants ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' young woman ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' racial minority ', ' racial identity ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIAMS,AUBURN UNIVERSITY AT AUBURN,R01,2018,358829,0.07630552075158208
"Resilient Profiles and College Adjustment Among Students PROJECT SUMMARY  Especially for racial/ethnic minority youth, a college degree can offer a pathway towards better wellbeing across the lifespan. Although many biracial students experience positive adjustment in college and go on to earn a college degree, over 35% of biracial students who begin college fail to earn a degree within 6 years. The lack of a college degree can have significant economic costs, and failure to complete a college degree can initiate a cascade of mental and physical effects. Biracial students may encounter unique stressors in college, such as discrimination, difficulty finding a place to “fit”, and forming and shifting their identity across contexts and time. Stress can impair emotional, social, and academic adjustment; when chronic, stress can also cumulatively affect physiology via a process commonly termed allostatic load, affecting long-term mental and physical health. Despite these risks, biracial students may have access to unique sources of resilience, promoting positive adjustment. However, we have little understanding of factors that promote resilience among biracial youth transitioning to college.  The proposed study will use a longitudinal approach to examine stress and resilience among biracial White/Hispanic college students. The project provides a chance to engage with this understudied population. Questionnaire and physiological data will be used to identify risk and resilient profiles of psychological, physiological, social, and cultural resources, which may promote or impair adjustment of biracial college students. The project will assess how these profiles affect stress, allostatic load, and trajectories of college adjustment over the first year of college. With the rapid growth of the biracial population in the U.S., filling gaps in research knowledge will help promote wellbeing among biracial individuals in college and into adulthood. An investigation of profiles of psychological, physiological, social, and cultural resilience resources is well-placed for translation into later preventative and intervention efforts with this understudied population.   PROJECT NARRATIVE  Despite the rapid growth of the biracial population, little work has been done to investigate sources of risk or resilience as biracial students adjust to the challenging college environment.

The stress associated with the acculturation process, acculturation stress, and resilience at the individual, family, community, and societal levels appear to play important roles in influencing risks. However, little is known about the causal mechanisms linking acculturation stress, resilience, and health outcomes among Hispanic immigrants. Further, little is known about what precise types of stressors (e.g., occupational stress vs. discrimination) and resilience factors (e.g., individual coping vs. family support) have the most important influence on health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants. The proposed longitudinal study (N = 385) will investigate the effects of acculturation stress and resilience on co-occurring substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV risk, and depression (i.e., syndemic conditions) and biological stress among young adult Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. More specifically, the proposed project aims to: 1) test theoretical links between the cumulative impact of acculturation stress and resilience on syndemic conditions and biological stress among recent young adult Hispanic immigrants over a two-year period, and 2) identify the specific types of acculturation stressors and resilience factors at the individual, family, community, and societal levels that are most important in predicting syndemic conditions and biological stress among this population over time. Young adult low-income Hispanic immigrant men and women within the first 10 years of immigration will be followed for two years. Biopsychosocial data will be collected from participants at baseline, and then 6 months (FU1), 12 months (FU2), 18 months (FU3), and 24 months later (FU4). Culturally specific measures of acculturation stress and resilience will be used to assess for individual, family, community, and societal risk and protective factors for syndemic conditions. Blood and urine samples will be obtained from participants to measure systemic inflammation (IL 6, IL8, and IL 18) and oxidative stress (F2 isoprostanes), previously validated biomarkers for psychological stress. Various descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistics, including latent growth curve modeling, will be used to address aims 1-2. The findings from this study have the potential to identify risk and protective factors for the decay in heath among Hispanic immigrants. A precise and culturally informed understanding of these phenomena is foundational for designing interventions that can ultimately promote the health and wellbeing of Hispanic immigrants, the largest immigrant group in the U.S. This study also has the potential to lay the theoretical foundation for biopsychosocial health disparities research in other populations. RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study seeks to describe the impact that acculturation stress and resilience plays in influencing behavioral, psychological, and biological health among young adult Hispanics who are recent immigrants. The findings from this study can inform interventions aiming to improve the health and well-being of Hispanic immigrants.","SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S.",9572960,R01MD012249,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Immigration ', ' Inflammation ', ' Influentials ', ' Language ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Violence ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Low income ', ' IL8 gene ', ' b-ENAP ', ' TSG-1 ', ' SCYB8 ', ' MONAP ', ' MDNCF ', ' LYNAP ', ' LUCT ', ' K60 ', ' IL8 ', ' IL-8 ', ' GCP1 ', ' CXCL8 ', ' AMCF-I ', ' 3-10C ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' family support ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' health care availability ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,703089,0.10393957536364046
"Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors Project Summary/Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and debilitating age-related health condition contributing toward physical and psychosocial decline, reduced quality of life, and rising national expenses. Considerable evidence demonstrates health disparities in the burdens of living with OA. Specifically, African Americans with knee OA experience greater clinical pain, functional limitations, and decreased quality of life compared to non-Hispanic whites. Pain is a key factor contributing to functional limitations and physical disability. Psychosocial stress predicts the onset of chronic pain and living with chronic pain contributes to increased psychosocial stress. Ethnic groups differ in environmental and sociocultural stress exposures. Importantly, the body is designed to adapt and strengthen with adequate recovery in response stress. However, persistent stress can take a toll on the system resulting in dysregulation and dysfunction known as allostatic load. Persistent stress and chronic pain contribute toward altered functioning across multiple biological systems including the brain. Structural and functional changes and accelerated aging in the brain have been observed among individuals with chronic pain, including those with knee OA. Altered stress-related biological functioning has also been indicated in individuals with chronic pain. These biological changes likely contribute to increased morbidity and mortality among those with chronic pain and OA. What is not known however is whether: 1) African Americans and non- Hispanic whites with knee OA differ across biological measures of aging, 2) biological measures of aging are inter-related, and 3) biological measures of aging predict ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. Importantly, there is evidence that health promoting behaviors and psychosocial factors may modulate the biological consequences of OA-related pain and stress. We will investigate a comprehensive array of biopsychosocial measures across three time points in a four year longitudinal analysis of 200 adults with knee OA (100 African Americans and 100 non-Hispanic whites) to determine the influence of stress exposure on measures of biological aging (allostatic load, telomere length, and brain structure/function), and the relationship between biological measures of aging and ethnic group differences in knee OA health outcomes. We will also evaluate the possible modulating effect of risk and resilience factors. Findings will 1) contribute to an improved understanding of the stress, resilience, aging, and health outcome dynamic; 2) promote the identification of biological markers sensitive to stress related exposure and indicative of health- related system functioning; and 3) elucidate resilience factors that may serve as clinical targets to reduce ethnic group disparities in OA and improve overall health outcomes. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis is a prevalent and debilitating age-related condition that unequally burdens African American adults compared to non-Hispanic white adults. There is a gap in knowledge regarding the transition from stress exposure to disparities in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. The goal of this project is to investigate the trajectory from stress exposure to biological measures of aging and stress-related system dysregulation (allostatic load, telomere length, changes in brain structure/function) to ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes over a four year period. The long-term intention is to identify strategies to reduce the burden and improve health outcomes for adults with osteoarthritis.","Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors",9519819,R01AG054370,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Buffers ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' chronic pain ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostatic load ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biological systems ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' stress symptom ', ' chronic MSK pain ', ' chronic musculoskeletal pain ', ' clinical pain ', ' osteoarthritis pain ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2018,687924,-0.10155775256260328
"RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULTS' PATHWAYS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong African American Families Healthy Adult Project (SHAPE) followed 493 African American youth from ages 11 to 20. Participants have grown up in rural Georgia communities in which poverty rates for African Americans are among the highest in the nation. Life in rural areas can be more challenging than in urban areas due to restricted educational and employment opportunities, difficulties in obtaining physical and mental health care, and a lack of public transportation. Despite living in such challenging situations, many SHAPE participants have displayed high levels of psychosocial functioning across adolescence. We identified naturally occurring factors in family and community networks that protected these youth from the consequences of SES- and race-related stressors that proliferate in rural Southern contexts. Epidemiological research reveals that African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of chronic diseases of aging (CDA) such as coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes. Emerging evidence indicates that contemporaneous health determinants in midlife or later cannot adequately account for why rural African Americans experience high rates of CDAs. Rather, many CDAs incubate in physiological systems for decades prior to the manifestation of disease. In the next 5 years, SHAPE participants will experience a stressful developmental transition. Job turnover rates are high, and the combined effects of poor preparation for employment and discriminatory hiring practices make obtaining stable employment a protracted and often demoralizing process. These stressors have the potential to take a toll on SHAPE participants' health, undermining psychosocial functioning and contributing to CDA-related vulnerabilities. To understand the pathways from stress exposure during childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood to CDA vulnerabilities and psychosocial outcomes, we propose to extend the SHAPE research program in two key ways. First we propose to augment our health assessment of SHAPE participants to include markers of metabolic syndrome and pro-inflammatory tendencies which are linked to the development of CDAs. Second, we propose to investigate a critical question for public health scientists and practitioners. In response to stress exposure, some SHAPE participants will evince escalation in CDA vulnerability whereas other will not. This proposal is designed to investigate why. Evidence from laboratory-based studies suggests a central role for psychosocial risk and protective mechanisms in young adulthood and earlier phases of development in altering the pathways linking stress exposure and CDA precursors. Prospective research investigating these risk and protective mechanisms, however, is virtually nonexistent. We thus propose to collect data from SHAPE participants, at ages 22 and 24 years, that includes CDA precursors along with assessments of environmental stressors, psychosocial adjustment, risk and protective mechanisms, HPA axis/SNS deregulation, and health behavior. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans in the rural South are among the most disadvantaged populations in the US in terms of health disparities. Recent research suggests that the roots of these disparities lie in earlier stages of development as young people cope with stressful environments. In this study we investigate the risk and protective processes that explain why some young adult rural African Americans develop vulnerabilities to chronic diseases and others do not.",RURAL AFRICAN AMERICAN YOUNG ADULTS' PATHWAYS TO PSYCHOSOCIAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH,9518994,R01HD030588,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Employment ', ' Environment ', ' Epinephrine ', ' Therapeutic Epinephrine ', ' Adrenaline ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Laboratories ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' Occupations ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Stress ', ' Sympathetic Nervous System ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Unemployment ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Weather ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Competence ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' urban area ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' Rural ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Community Networks ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Psychological adjustment ', ' Psychological Adaptation ', ' Psychologic Adaptation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Incubated ', ' Data ', ' Metabolic Marker ', ' Proliferating ', ' Employment Opportunities ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' discount ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' discounting ', ' coping ', ' prospective ', ' public health relevance ', ' psychosocial adjustment ', ' racial identity ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' rural African American ', ' health assessment ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2018,624332,0.058360032826123245
"Stress, Epigenetics and Aging Project Summary There is extensive evidence that socioeconomic status (SES) and social stressors shape the development of numerous chronic conditions and aging-related illnesses. However, the processes through which SES and social stress affect biological processes related to aging and disease development have not been fully elucidated, particularly at the cellular level. This is important to investigate among African Americans who have higher mortality, shorter lifespan, and experience a disproportionate burden of disease than whites. Research examining associations between stressors and biological aging processes have been predominately cross- sectional in nature and have included predominately racially and ethnically homogenous samples. No prior studies have assessed the independent and cumulative impact of SES and stress at multiple time points across the life course in relation to biomarkers of aging (e.g. telomere length, DNA methylation age). Furthermore, little is know as to whether behavioral and psychological factors mediate the association between stress and biological aging processes, and whether forms of resilience (e.g., coping response, social support) may modify these associations. We propose to leverage existing data from the Disparities (DISPAR) study to examine the relationship between stressors and resilience across the life course in relation to biological aging processes. The DISPAR study conducted a 50-year follow-up of women who participated in a pregnancy cohort between 1959 and 1957 in Alameda County, California. Subsets of offspring were followed at ages 5 y, 9-11 y, 15-17y, and 50 years. The DISPAR sample includes a representative subsample (n=605) of these children interviewed as adults (mean age of 50 years), 42% African-American and 50% female. Validated measures of negative life events, discrimination, caregiving stress, mental health, social support, and coping mechanisms among others were collected. In addition, anthropometric measures, blood pressure and a blood sample were collected. For this study (N=372), we propose to assay existing stored blood collected at age 50 for biomarkers of biological aging (telomere length, methylation age). We will examine the role of childhood and adult SES and psychosocial stressors (e.g. child adversity, caregiving stress, job stress, racial discrimination) on telomere length and methylation age in adulthood. Additionally, we propose to examine behavioral (e.g. physical activity, smoking) and psychological (e.g. distress) responses to stress as potential mediators of these associations, and positive and negative coping factors as potential modifiers of the associations between SES, stress and biological processes. Given that half of our sample is African-American, we will have the opportunity to assess how stress, resilience-based factors, and associated biological aging processes differ by race. Completion of this project would allow us to elucidate important biological, genetic, and epigenetic pathways that help explain how stress and resilience shapes population health disparities among aging populations. Project Narrative Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress are increasingly recognized as important factors that shape the development of chronic diseases and aging-related illnesses, particularly among African Americans, who experience a disproportionate burden of disease. However, the pathways through which stress affects obesity the biological pathways related to health disparities are not fully understood, particularly at the cellular level, and most research to date has been cross-sectional and among samples that lack racial diversity. We propose to address these gaps by examining the independent and cumulative impact of both SES and social stress at multiple points across the life course in relation to DNA methylation (e.g. DNA methylation age, genome-wide methylation) and telomere length among a diverse sample of whites and African Americans, as well as forms of resilience and coping in response to these stressors.","Stress, Epigenetics and Aging",9500788,R01AG058704,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect

"NEURAL MECHANISMS IN WOMEN’S TREATMENT AND EARLY RECOVERY ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Psychological stress is a causal factor in the pathogenesis of substance use disorder (SUD) and relapse risk. Low-income women report high levels of stress in SUD residential treatment stemming from significant economic and family stressors in addition to challenges adjusting to residential treatment demands. Unmanaged stress, especially in early stages of residential treatment, is a major concern because it can increase dropout. Dropout from residential treatment places women at risk of substance use relapse. A gap in knowledge persists regarding the use of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) with racially and ethnically diverse low-income women with SUDs, especially regarding the efficacy of adapted MBIs for preventing residential dropout and decreasing relapse. The long-term goal of this application is to improve treatment outcomes in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women with SUDs by targeting stress, residential dropout, and relapse. We have fully adapted, developed, and pilot tested a novel MBI, Moment-by-Moment in Women's Recovery: Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention for Women (MBRP-W), that supports the needs of women in residential treatment. It showed promising results in substance use and perceived stress outcomes and no racial or ethnic differences in outcomes. This MBI integrates relapse prevention, addresses literacy level, and is relevant to issues surrounding treatment- and relapse-related stressors of disadvantaged women. The central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing three specific aims: (1) to test the efficacy of MBRP-W on residential treatment (a) retention and (b) substance use relapse in Black, Hispanic and White low-income women to determine; (2) the mechanisms of change underlying the MBRP-W program; and (3) if changes in hair cortisol as a marker of chronic stress provide a more powerful measure of stress compared to self- reported stress as a mechanism of change. A rationale for MBRP-W is the need for self-initiated stress management skills in women with SUDs during the early stressful periods of residential treatment that increase risk of dropout and relapse. The unique strengths of this application are its focus on underserved populations, residential dropout, and relapse outcomes, and the first-ever inclusion of a chronic stress biomarker in MBI research in the form of hair cortisol. The proposed work is innovative in that it intends to reduce stress in women to improve both retention and relapse outcomes. The expected results will define a viable integrative treatment that can improve stress management skills and treatment outcomes and will evaluate the utility of a biomarker of chronic stress. Results of this study will have a positive impact on substance use recovery outcomes in diverse groups of low-income women and identify mechanisms of action to inform future SUD treatment. The project's public health impact meets NIDA goals because it intends to prevent the escalation of addiction and its health consequences by offering a novel treatment accessible to undeserved women that is expected to decrease addiction-related racial and ethnic and gender-based health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Approximately 25 million Americans struggle with alcohol or drug problems annually. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is costly to our nation, exacting more than $428 billion in costs related to crime, lost work productivity and health care. While effective treatments exist, over half of those who enter treatment for substance use disorders drop out early in treatment and return to alcohol or drug abuse. The proposed research addresses this public health problem directly by testing an innovative approach to increasing treatment retention and reducing relapse among a diverse and underserved group of

"Mental Stress and Myocardial Ischemia after MI: Sex Differences, Mechanisms and Prognosis Young women with a myocardial infarction (MI) have emerged as a group in need of special study, as they have higher mortality compared with men of similar age despite less severe disease. These disparities remain unexplained and suggest sex differences in the pathophysiology, risk factors and prognostic factors of acute MI. The psychosocial sphere is a largely neglected area for the prevention of ischemic heart disease in women. In the previous funding period (R01 HL109413) we assembled a cohort of early-onset (≤60 years of age) post-MI patients, 50% women, and sex- and age-matched community controls—the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress (MIMS)2 study. We used a laboratory protocol to study mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSI), a marker of stress vulnerability and significant prognostic factor in people with coronary artery disease. We found that young women with MI have twice the rate of MSI than men of similar age. We also found that the mechanisms of MSI differ by sex. While in men MSI is primarily due to supply-demand mismatch, in women it is driven by microvascular vasoconstriction. Despite significant progress in our previous funding period, many questions still remain. First, the clinical implications of MSI in women are unknown, since former studies have mostly examined men. Second, the pathways through which MSI contributes to adverse events are unclear. Based on our data, processes involving vascular and immune function could be especially important for women, but this has never been tested. Third, the underlying mechanisms for the higher rate of MSI in young women are unclear. In addition to differences in physiology, MSI could reflect differences in enduring daily life stressors and/or affect/emotions. Building on this previous work, the goal of this competitive renewal is to clarify sex differences in pathways of risk linking emotional stress to MSI and clinical outcomes in young post-MI patients. Within 8 months of MI, 300 new patients younger than 61 years, 50% women, will be tested in the lab for MSI using our established protocol with myocardial perfusion imaging with the same modalities as MIMS2. Subjects will be monitored at home for 1 week, and then followed for clinical events. The proposed sample (MIMS3) will augment our existing cohort (MIMS2), doubling its size to 600 patients so as to make it suitable for the assessment of clinical outcomes. The specific aims are: 1) Examine whether MSI is related to clinical outcomes in both women and men (a composite endpoint of recurrent MI, unstable angina, heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death). 2) Examine whether vascular responses to mental stress are related to the clinical endpoint, including endothelium-dependent and microvascular function, and peripheral vasoconstriction; in an exploratory fashion, we will also examine markers of autonomic dysregulation, inflammation, myocardial injury and repair in response to mental stress. 3) Examine sex differences in stressful events and autonomic function during daily life and their relation with MSI during one week of home monitoring. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the primary cause of death in American women and yet, many questions remain about the unique characteristics of this disease in women. Younger women with CHD remain understudied and our research suggests that they may be especially vulnerable to the effects of psychological stress. Building on our previous work, this competing renewal application will clarify sex differences in pathways of risk linking emotional stress to myocardial ischemia and clinical outcomes in young patients with a myocardial infarction, and will provide critical information relevant to the pathophysiology and prevention of CHD in women.","Mental Stress and Myocardial Ischemia after MI: Sex Differences, Mechanisms and Prognosis",9819132,R01HL109413,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Unstable angina ', ' Preinfarction Angina ', ' Angina at Rest ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Emotions ', ' Endothelium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Goals ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' sleep disruption ', ' poor sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' Standardization ', ' Progenitor Cells ', ' Stem cells ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Testing ', ' Troponin ', ' vascular constriction ', ' vasoconstriction ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Link ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Funding ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Life ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse event ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' heart disease prevention ', ' heart disorder prevention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Myocardial ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' early onset ', ' injury and repair ', ' reconstruction ', ' neglect ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' older women ', ' clinically significant ', ' clinical significance ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' stress symptom ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' early life adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' early adversity ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,778272,0.07896874508590201
"An Interpersonal Relationships Intervention for Improving Cardiovascular Health in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY Disparities in cardiovascular (CV) diseases by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity are pronounced in our society, and the processes that lead to these disparities begin in childhood. Previous intervention efforts have targeted individual lifestyle changes in health behaviors, but with limited success in low SES, minority youth. We propose a novel intervention to reduce CV risk in low SES, minority children (under 21 by NIH guidelines) that focuses on social relationships – specifically mentoring – as a way to create bi-directional benefits for CV health in youth. The rationale for this intervention is based both on work showing that receiving social support has benefits for physical health, and on work demonstrating that helping others is associated with better physical health. In this proposed intervention study, college students will serve as mentors to elementary school students (8th graders). 250 college students and 250 Chicago Public School 8th graders will be randomized to either serve as a mentor/mentee or to be in a control group. Students will participate in a weekly mentoring intervention throughout one school year. Assessments will occur at 3 time points during the school year. All mentors and mentees will come from low-income families and underrepresented minority groups, thus allowing us to focus on improving CV health in an at-risk population that experiences a disproportionate share of the CV burden in the U.S. The first aim of the project is to investigate whether mentors can reduce CV risk (obesity; blood pressure; cholesterol; blood glucose) in low-income, minority youth mentees relative to a control group of 8th graders. The second aim is to investigate whether serving as a mentor can reduce CV risk in the college student mentors compared to a control group of college students. The third aim is to understand how mentoring influences the intervention targets of psychosocial, health behavior, and biological variables, and whether these variables mediate the impact of mentoring on CV health. Drawing from the stress buffering model of social support, we propose that mentoring fosters the development of strong social relationships that can scaffold behavioral changes and hence mitigate the effects that stress has on inflammation and CV health via 2 pathways: psychophysiological and health behaviors. In the psychophysiological pathway, mentoring creates more adaptive cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to life stressors, which in turn mitigate responses of the sympathetic and neuroendocrine systems to stress. Over time, this reduces inflammation and improves CV health. In the health behaviors pathway, the scaffolding from mentoring relationships mitigates the associations of stress with detrimental health behaviors that in turn are linked to both inflammation and CV health. Through this study, we take a social relationships- oriented primary prevention approach to reducing health disparities by targeting CV risk factors that emerge early in life and that predict clinical CV disease outcomes into adulthood and by focusing on low-income, minority mentors and mentees who represent an at-risk, underserved, and disadvantaged group of youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT This project will implement a mentoring intervention pairing low-income minority college students as mentors to low-income minority elementary school students, and investigate the effects of mentoring on the cardiovascular health of both mentees and mentors. From a single intervention, we have the potential to create cardiovascular health benefits among both younger youth (mentees) and older youth (mentors) simultaneously through a novel approach that focuses on the beneficial influences that a social relationship between a mentor and mentee can have in helping to scaffold positive behavioral changes. This project takes a primary prevention approach by focusing on cardiovascular risk factors that emerge during childhood and as well, targets health disparities by focusing on an at-risk group of

"Improving maternal and child health through prenatal fatty acid supplementation: A randomized controlled study in African American women living in low-income urban environments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnant women living in poverty often experience chronic stress and consequently higher levels of stress hormones. In utero exposure to high levels of stress hormones can negatively affect the developing fetus and the infant's capacity for emotion and behavioral regulation. In this application we describe a developing program of research designed to reduce the negative impact of prenatal stress on infant health and development via nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy. DHA is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member of the omega-3 fatty acid family. DHA is found in its highest concentrations in neural cell membranes, affecting receptor function, neurotransmitter uptake, and signal transmission. There is growing evidence that low levels of dietary DHA intake are associated with suboptimal response to stress and that DHA supplementation can modulate stress response. Aims: The goals of the proposed study are to test whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy is associated with 1) improved maternal health during pregnancy among African American women living in urban poverty; 2) improved infant birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and 3) whether the association between DHA supplementation during pregnancy and infant outcomes is partially mediated by reductions in maternal perceived stress and stress reactivity during pregnancy. Approach: One hundred sixty-two pregnant African American women living in urban poverty, who consume less than two servings of fish per week, will be randomly assigned to receive 450 mg/daily of DHA or placebo beginning at 9-12 weeks of gestation through the end of pregnancy. Perceived stress, stressful life events, anxiety, and depression, inflammatory markers, DHA levels and response to a laboratory stressor will be assessed at baseline and at 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes (e.g., gestational age, birth weight, delivery complications) will be collected from medical records, and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress reactivity will be assessed at 1, 4 and 9 months of age. Investigators: This application builds on a recently completed NICHD/NIMH funded R21 (PI: Keenan), which yielded preliminary evidence that DHA supplementation during pregnancy reduces perceived stress and cortisol response to stress in pregnant African American women living in low-income, urban environments. Drs. Keenan and Hipwell and Ms. Wroblewksi were investigators on the R21 and will continue to work together on the proposed study. Dr. Della Torre is an Assistant Professor of Obstetrics at the University of Chicago, who specializes in providing clinical services to African American women living in the south side of Chicago. Innovation: This will be the first large randomized controlled study of the effect of DHA supplementation in pregnant African American women living in urban poverty on maternal and infant health and stress response. Impact: If DHA supplementation is associated with reductions in perceived stress, more modulated maternal cortisol response to stress, and more optimal emotional and behavioral regulation in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program of research on the mechanisms by which these associations evolve can be launched and broad-based prevention interventions that target maternal and child in vulnerable populations can be implemented, potentially leading to reductions health disparities in the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of the effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in pregnant women living in urban, low-income environments on stress regulation during pregnancy. If essential fatty acid supplementation is associated with reductions in the experience of stress, more modulated biological response to stress, and more optimal stress regulation and neurodevelopment in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program on the mechanisms by which nutrition reduces the negative impact on prenatal stress on the offspring can be launched.

"Post Maria Puerto Rican Families Relocated to Florida:  A Multisite Study of Alcohol Misuse and Mental Health Problems Project Summary/Abstract In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans sought refuge on the US mainland, with the majority relocating to South and Central Florida. More than one year after the hurricane, frontline journalism and our preliminary research make clear that many post-Maria survivors plan to stay on the US mainland for the foreseeable future. And yet, at present, our understanding of displaced Puerto Ricans remains very limited. Data from our pilot studies and our ongoing work suggests that, among the myriad issues faced by this population, alcohol misuse and mental health problems are particularly serious challenges. Of concern, in particular, is that stress and trauma caused by the storm will lead to greater alcohol misuse and mental health problems among Puerto Rican adults and their children, especially when coupled with the migration-related cultural stress stemming from an unplanned, abrupt, and long-term displacement from the island territory with its distinct culture and language. The proposed study is oriented around three objectives designed to build in a programmatic fashion. The first objective relates to the emerging public health needs of migrants in the aftermath of the storm; namely, to provide an epidemiologic portrait of the characteristics, experiences, and needs of post-Maria Puerto Rican families who relocated to Florida. The second objective focuses on broader theoretical issues related to post-disaster migration and adaptation; namely, to examine the prospective association between [a] trauma, cultural stress, family functioning and [b] alcohol misuse and mental health problems, and to conduct a differential test of cultural stress theory in South and Central Florida to inform intervention development in each region. Based on our prior research and cultural stress theory, our central hypothesis is that families relocating to South Florida (a bilingual region where Latino cultural influences are celebrated) will experience less migration-related cultural stress and, consequently, enjoy greater family functioning and fewer alcohol misuse and mental health problems compared to those in Central Florida (an area with a relatively recent uptick in Puerto Rican and other Latino migration). The third objective focuses on ensuring—via engagement with stakeholders and participants—that study findings are effectively translated to real world practice. The scientific premise for this study is to inform efforts to support displaced Puerto Ricans and advance theorizing on disaster-related migration and health. We will pursue the following specific aims: [1] Describe the characteristics, experiences, and needs post-Maria Puerto Rican families in Florida; [2] Examine prospective relationships to test cultural stress theory across distinct resettlement contexts; and [3] Engage with stakeholders and participants to develop guidelines, best practices, and intervention recommendations for dissemination and testing in future research. The contribution of this study is significant because it lays groundwork for the development of evidence-based interventions for the needs of an at-risk group, and promises to answer context-specific questions central to the advancement of cultural stress theory and broader theorizing around migrant adaptation and key outcomes. Project Narrative: Public Health Relevance The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will provide critical insight into the disaster- and migration-related experiences of Puerto Rican families in the aftermath of one of the costliest natural disasters in United States' history. Such research would provide information vital to the development of evidence-based programs designed to target alcohol misuse and mental health problems among a large and at-risk population of US-citizen migrants. The proposed project is highly relevant to NIMHD's mission in that it will directly inform efforts to address alcohol misuse and mental health problems among a subgroup of minority and vulnerable families who are experiencing significant health disparities related to stress, trauma, and migration-related consequences.",Post Maria Puerto Rican Families Relocated to Florida:  A Multisite Study of Alcohol Misuse and Mental Health Problems,9839031,R01MD014694,"['Hurricane ', ' Interview ', ' Island ', ' Language ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Parents ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Rain ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Water ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' alcohol measurement ', ' ethyl alcohol measurements ', ' ethanol measurement ', ' alcohol level ', ' ETOH level ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Internet ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' bilingualism ', ' bilingual ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Distant ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Journalism ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Portraits ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' migration ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Evidence based program ', ' stem ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' public health relevance ', ' traumatic event ', ' Migrant ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Disasters ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Electricity ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Family ', ' Florida ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2019,670926,0.01550847622086573
"Biopsyochosocial Mechanisms of Lupus Progression in African American Women PROJECT SUMMARY  Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is an inflammatory, autoimmune disease that disproportionally burdens African American women with more rapid disease progression and worse outcomes compared to their White counterparts. Increasing evidence suggests racial disparities in SLE progression are due in part to disproportionate exposure to psychosocial stress, as well as qualitatively unique racial minority stressors, which accelerate physiologic deterioration and may undermine shared inflammatory stress-response pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Routine experiences of psychosocial stress are common in the lives of African American women with SLE and can include stressors inherent with managing a chronic illness, in addition to those stemming from community disadvantage and poverty. African American women also face distinct forms of psychosocial stress, including experiences of racial discrimination and exposure to other race- related stressors. Despite existing evidence, mechanisms for racial disparities in SLE progression are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge among African American women with SLE, this study aims to: (1) examine understudied dimensions of race-related psychosocial stress in relation to disease activity and organ damage; (2) examine the influence of area-level neighborhood characteristics and stressors on rates of SLE progression; and (3) identify trajectories in biomarkers of inflammation relevant to SLE and identify high- risk subgroups. Data for the proposed analyses are from the Black Women's Experiences Living with Lupus (BeWELL) Study, one of the largest and most comprehensive studies on the social epidemiology of SLE. The BeWELL Study represents a rigorous assessment of rich psychosocial factors, validated measures of disease outcomes, and objective inflammatory biomarkers among an innovative population-based sample of African American women with confirmed SLE (n=438) living in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. The proposed research will leverage the strengths of the BeWELL Study and yield insight into specific pathways that may contribute to the disproportionate rate of SLE progression experienced by African American women. We will investigate the role of novel race-related psychosocial stressors on SLE outcomes, including “secondhand” or vicarious exposure to racist incidents, subtle everyday slights or microaggressions, and anticipation of experiencing racial threats. Multilevel analyses will examine the influence of spatial factors, specifically socioeconomic disadvantage and racial residential segregation on SLE outcomes. Trajectories in inflammation will be identified and explored in relation to sociodemographic, mental and physical health factors. Longitudinal methodological approaches will be utilized to help support causal inference. Training activities throughout the proposed fellowship will develop skill sets and enhance knowledge needed to conduct the intended analyses and prepare for a career in research. Various opportunities for professional development and mentorship from a diverse team of scholars will facilitate this goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Racial disparities in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) progression are widening, and SLE complications disproportionally affect African American women. The proposed project will help to unravel the constellation of risk factors that contribute to poor health outcomes impacting African American women with SLE. Findings from the proposed research will contribute to literature on the social determinants of SLE, and will inform intervention and policy efforts by identifying risk factors for accelerated disease progression in this population.",Biopsyochosocial Mechanisms of Lupus Progression in African American Women,9836457,F31AR076234,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arthralgia ', ' Joint Pain ', ' Autoimmune Diseases ', ' autoimmune disorder ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Censuses ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Skin Rash ', ' Rash ', ' Exanthem ', ' Exanthema ', ' Exercise ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Fellowship ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Inflammation ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Literature ', ' systemic lupus erythematosis ', ' disseminated lupus erythematosus ', ' Systemic SLE -

"Ethnic Influences on Stress, Energy Balance and Obesity in Adolescents Obesity is one of the most serious public health problems in the US; its prevalence has tripled in the last three decades and is associated with a range of short- and long-term medical and psychosocial problems. Adolescence is a critical period for the development and persistence of obesity, and is associated with changes in diet, physical activity and fitness, fat distribution and insulin sensitivity. There are racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity. African-American (AA) females have the highest rates of obesity, and the clustered risk factors for coronary heart disease and metabolic syndrome are twice that of AA males. The reasons for racial and sex-specific disparities in the prevalence and burden of obesity are not well understood. AA experience higher stress levels than Non-Hispanic Whites (NHW) due to economic and social inequalities, and the effect of stress on energy-dense diet and adiposity is more prominent in females. A better understanding of the mechanisms that link stress to obesity, particularly during adolescence when high rates of obesity, increased stressful experiences and stronger behavioral and physiological responses to stress emerge, will contribute to new clinical guidelines for reducing obesity and associated medical conditions in AA females.  The Physiological stress system affects obesity and mediates its adaptive functions via hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Prolonged stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion promotes the consumption of energy-dense diet (EI) and abdominal fat deposition both directly and indirectly through its effects on metabolic hormones. Stress also reduces physical activity and alters energy balance. The proposed study will examine the effects of stress and HPA axis on EI and physical activity-related energy expenditure in 100 AA and 100 NHW adolescent females. The effects on EI will be assessed in two contexts, the natural environment and under controlled conditions incorporating a standardized psychosocial stressor. Stress will be assessed in the natural environment as multiple domains (i.e., individual, family and social), and several indices of the HPA axis will be obtained to represent diurnal variation, its status over 12-15 weeks and reactivity to stress. Obesity- related parameters will be measured through anthropometry, fat distribution and cardio-metabolic biomarkers.  Associations among stress, HPA activity/function, energy balance and obesity-related parameters will be compared between and within AA and NHW samples. In combination they will improve our understanding of the social factors and biobehavioral mechanisms of both racial and individual differences in obesity and facilitate the development of effective treatments within and across racial groups according to the principles of individualized medicine. To our knowledge, racial differences in objectively-measured diet intake and energy expenditure in response to stress, or their underlying physiological mechanisms, have not been assessed in adolescents or adults. This is an important knowledge gap in our efforts to develop better evidence-based translational obesity prevention and weight-control interventions as the traditional interventions are not effective with minority youth. Obesity carries a substantial burden, and often develops in adolescence, persists into adult life and is almost twice as prevalent in African-American women compared to Caucasian women. We will test whether African- American girls consume more sweet and fatty foods and engage in less physical activity when stressed than Caucasians girls, and if stress hormones explain these differences. We will also test whether the differences in diet, activity and hormones account for the higher rates of obesity in African-American girls.","Ethnic Influences on Stress, Energy Balance and Obesity in Adolescents",9647373,R01MD010757,"['Abbreviations ', ' Accounting ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Female Adolescents ', ' adolescent girl ', ' Adrenal Glands ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Anthropometry ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Body Composition ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Client ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Environment ', ' artificial environment ', ' Controlled Environment ', ' Family ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fasting ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Female ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' indexing ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Interview ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health problems are proportionately affect racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as populations that face chronic economic hardship (Evans, Wolf & Adler, 2012). There is clear evidence that (1) the processes that lay the groundwork for mental health disparities is laid during childhood (e.g., Chen & Miller, 2012) and (2) that damage to and dysregulation of the physiologic stress response is a powerful mechanism of the effects of chronic stress such as that associated with poverty on psychopathology (e.g., Evans & Kim, 2012). To contribute solutions to mental health disparities, we need interventions capable of affecting the systems that confer the risk. Since the psychobiologic stress response system (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis; HPA) is a central mechanism linking health disparities to chronic stress, the stress response is a critical system to target. Improving children's ability to cope with stress and regulate their reactivity ha the potential to break the cycle of damage, especially if the coping strategies and regulatory processes that we target have effects at the physiologic level. Preliminary evidence from the PIs research lab has emerged showing that different types of coping are evident at the level of the HPA-it is, therefore, time to evaluate whether a coping intervention designed for children facing chronic stress will both (a) improve children's ability to use primary and secondary control coping, and (b) have sustained effects at the physiologic level. We have developed just such an intervention, which builds on these exciting new findings and is designed to address core underlying mechanisms of risk and repair in the highly stressful context of poor, urban youths' lives.  Preadolescence is a crucial time during which children's ability to recognize stress and it causes matures, and repertoires for coping with stress grow in both size and complexity. In addition, preadolescence is a time of increased brain changes and growth in key self-regulatory organs and systems. Preadolescents are, therefore, at a ripe stage to benefit from coping-based prevention and the plasticity of this developmental period suggests that such changes have the potential to be long-lasting. Our new prevention program is designed to prevent the onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in preadolescent children facing chronic stress. Two mechanisms of action are targeted in this project. First, the project seeks to demonstrate that children facing chronic stress stemming from poverty, discrimination, and violence exposure can acquire and utilize new ways of coping that are adaptive in a wide variety of circumstances. Second, the project will examine the extent to which improved coping resulting from the intervention engages the physiologic intermediate mechanism of the HPA. Finally, the project aims to link changes in coping and the HPA to changes in internalizing symptoms that would signal prevention of the emergence of new or worsening of existing symptoms. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system that leads to psychopathology can offer new directions for combatting health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and socioeconomic disparities in physical and mental health problems are large, persistent, and severe; begin during childhood; and stem from in part damage to physiologic stress response systems caused by chronic stress. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system may offer new directions for combatting health disparities. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a new prevention program designed to teach preadolescent children effective ways for coping with chronic stress that will have direct effects on their physiologic stress response systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and ultimately prevent onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms and disorders.",Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress,9658558,R33MH107631,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Economics ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Learning ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' repaired ', ' repair ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Wolves ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' showing emotion ', ' expression of emotion ', ' emotional expression ', ' body system ', ' Organ System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' preadolescence ', ' preteen ', ' pre-adolescent ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' Prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenic ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' Phased Innovation Awards ', ' R21/R33 Program ', ' R21/R33 Mechanism ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' functional outcomes ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' psychobiologic ', ' psychobiological ', ' stem ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' intervention effect ', ' coping mechanism ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' anxious symptom ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' violence victimization ', ' racial minority ', ' psychological symptom ', ' stress symptom ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' violence exposure ', ' exposure to violence ', ' ']",NIMH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R33,2019,716244,0.18156684209296528
"Molecular Epidemiology of Oxidative Stress and Related Cancers in Black Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxidative stress is defined as an ""imbalance in pro-oxidants and antioxidants with associated disruption of redox circuitry and macromolecular damage"". Chronic oxidative stress is believed to increase the risk of many cancers such as breast and colorectal cancers. Despite being at increased risk of developing and dying from oxidative-stress related cancers, African-Americans are under-represented in population-based studies of oxidative stress and cancer. This is especially true for biomarker-based and nutritional epidemiology studies of oxidative stress. This career development award is designed to provide training and research experience to Dr. Dash to support his goal of becoming an independent researcher investigating the molecular epidemiology of cancers among minorities including cancer disparities. Proposed training plans include mentorship and coursework in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and exploratory data analysis, filling gaps in research training related to studies among minorities and health disparity studies, and research considerations in recruitment and bio specimen collection from minorities in epidemiologic research. The research component of the proposal aims to address the research gaps mentioned above by (1) characterizing the systemic oxidative stress burden via measurement of a panel of known biomarkers of oxidative stress using proteomics and metabolomics technologies; (2) identifying dietary patterns associated with oxidative stress; and (3) investigating the association of these dietary patterns with risk of breast and colorectal cancers among African- American women. The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involves measurement of a panel of 6 oxidative stress biomarkers using proteomic and metabolomic approaches and describing the oxidative stress burden among African-American women without cancer. Dietary patterns related to the biomarkers of oxidative stress will also be identified usin dietary intake data self-reported by participants on food frequency questionnaires. Phase 2 of the study involves investigating the association of the oxidative stress-related dietary patterns developed in Phase 1 with breast and colon cancer risk in a large, nationally-representative, cohort study of Black women. Results from the study will support larger and more definitive studies on oxidative stress and cancer among African-American women. The proposed research complements the training and mentorship plans in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and minority health research. With this award Dr. Chiranjeev Dash will combine his previous training in epidemiology with advanced training in metabolomics/proteomics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, and gain experience in conduct of minority health research to establish an independent research career focusing on translational research on the molecular epidemiology of oxidative stress in cancer causation and prevention.

"SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to experience negative health outcomes the longer they live in the U.S. For example, over time Hispanic immigrants engage in riskier behaviors such as substance abuse, violence, and risky sex, and experience more depressive symptoms. The stress associated with the acculturation process, acculturation stress, and resilience at the individual, family, community, and societal levels appear to play important roles in influencing risks. However, little is known about the causal mechanisms linking acculturation stress, resilience, and health outcomes among Hispanic immigrants. Further, little is known about what precise types of stressors (e.g., occupational stress vs. discrimination) and resilience factors (e.g., individual coping vs. family support) have the most important influence on health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants. The proposed longitudinal study (N = 385) will investigate the effects of acculturation stress and resilience on co-occurring substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV risk, and depression (i.e., syndemic conditions) and biological stress among young adult Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. More specifically, the proposed project aims to: 1) test theoretical links between the cumulative impact of acculturation stress and resilience on syndemic conditions and biological stress among recent young adult Hispanic immigrants over a two-year period, and 2) identify the specific types of acculturation stressors and resilience factors at the individual, family, community, and societal levels that are most important in predicting syndemic conditions and biological stress among this population over time. Young adult low-income Hispanic immigrant men and women within the first 10 years of immigration will be followed for two years. Biopsychosocial data will be collected from participants at baseline, and then 6 months (FU1), 12 months (FU2), 18 months (FU3), and 24 months later (FU4). Culturally specific measures of acculturation stress and resilience will be used to assess for individual, family, community, and societal risk and protective factors for syndemic conditions. Blood and urine samples will be obtained from participants to measure systemic inflammation (IL 6, IL8, and IL 18) and oxidative stress (F2 isoprostanes), previously validated biomarkers for psychological stress. Various descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistics, including latent growth curve modeling, will be used to address aims 1-2. The findings from this study have the potential to identify risk and protective factors for the decay in heath among Hispanic immigrants. A precise and culturally informed understanding of these phenomena is foundational for designing interventions that can ultimately promote the health and wellbeing of Hispanic immigrants, the largest immigrant group in the U.S. This study also has the potential to lay the theoretical foundation for biopsychosocial health disparities research in other populations. RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study seeks to describe the impact that acculturation stress and resilience plays in influencing behavioral, psychological, and biological health among young adult Hispanics who are recent immigrants. The findings from this study can inform interventions aiming to improve the health and well-being of Hispanic immigrants.","SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S.",9712686,R01MD012249,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Immigration ', ' Inflammation ', ' Influentials ', ' Language ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Perception ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' IL8 gene ', ' b-ENAP ', ' TSG-1 ', ' SCYB8 ', ' MONAP ', ' MDNCF ', ' LYNAP ', ' LUCT ', ' K60 ', ' IL8 ', ' IL-8 ', ' GCP1 ', ' CXCL8 ', ' AMCF-I ', ' 3-10C ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' family support ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,832062,0.10393957536364046
"A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this study is to determine how different trajectories of minority stress experienced throughout adolescence may predict behavioral health outcomes for SMA. Relying on methods established and tested in our preliminary work, we will recruit a national sample of diverse SMA (e.g., race and ethnicity, gender, urban vs. rural; N = 1,500) through both social media and respondent-driven sampling strategies in the first year of the project. We will follow participants for three years, incorporating the fundamental tenets of developmental psychopathology, which suggest that examining risk and protective factors for adolescents necessitates longitudinal exploration across critical stages of development. Guiding the proposal are three specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the individual and group trajectories of minority stress over time by following a national sample of SMA (N = 1,500) for 3 years. WH1: There will be differences in minority stress across adolescent development. Aim 2: Determine whether trajectories of minority stress are associated with differences in behavioral health outcomes over time. WH2.1: Trajectories of minority stress and behavioral health outcomes will be associated over time. WH2.2: Reporting higher levels of minority stress in early adolescence will be associated with poorer behavioral health outcomes in later adolescence. Aim 3: Determine whether the association between minority stress and behavioral health over time is different based on sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., urbanicity, gender, race and ethnicity). WH3: There will be significant differences in outcome trajectories by demographic subgroup. WH4: Trajectories of minority stress will be inversely associated with protective factors over time and will differ by demographic subgroup. To test our hypotheses, we propose cutting-edge longitudinal quantitative methodology including latent growth-curve modeling, which are rarely used to examine longitudinal risk among SMAs. The proposed research will be the first to determine how minority stress may influence health across adolescence, and this information can be used directly to inform clinical assessment and the development of targeted behavioral health interventions for this high-need population. Project Narrative Sexual minority adolescents (SMA; adolescents who report a same-sex sexual orientation) are at much higher risk for behavioral health concerns than their heterosexual peers, yet little is known about how different patterns of gay-related stress over time impacts mental/behavioral health outcomes. The proposed research is to examine the individual and group trajectories of sexual minority adolescents (ages 14 to 17 at baseline) and examine how differences in these trajectories predict behavioral health outcomes. The resulting knowledge can be used to inform clinical assessment and the development of effective targeted behavioral health interventions to reduce the behavioral health disparities found in this high need population.",A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents,9697192,R01MD012252,"['Academy ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Psychometrics ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Psychopathology ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' self injury ', ' self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' intentional self harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Respondent ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Marshal ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' life history ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' high risk ', ' early adolescence ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobia ', ' Homophobic ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' LGB ', ' Same-sex ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2019,706747,0.07466901078672034
"Epigenomic Predictors of PTSD and Traumatic Stress in an African American Cohort PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common and debilitating mental disorder that has a profound public health impact and for which the disease burden falls disproportionately on African Americans (AAs). Socially adverse experiences of discrimination and isolation, stressful life events, and low socioeconomic position (SEP) have a profound impact on mental and physical health, with AAs being more likely to encounter many of these exposures; yet how these exposures become translated into ill health, in particular poor mental health, is unclear. To address this gap in knowledge, this application seeks to determine whether social adversity among AA residents of Detroit impacts glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network (GRRN) DNA methylation to lay the foundation for future risk of psychopathology. Exposure to stressful and traumatic events produces a physiologic cascade that includes epigenetic modification of genes whose activity contributes to psychopathological development. In particular, stress hormones (e.g. glucocorticoids) and genomic factors associated with them have been strongly linked to etiology of PTSD and other stress-related mental disorder. It remains unknown to what extent socially adverse exposures such as low SEP, discrimination, loneliness, and stressful life events impact DNA methylation in genes belonging to this pathway. We hypothesize that DNA methylation of GRRN genes in leukocytes is associated with prospective risk of PTSD and traumatic stress in Detroit-dwelling AAs, due to their role in the physiology of stress in both central and peripheral tissues. We further hypothesize that exposure to socioeconomic and psychosocial stressors impact DNA methylation variation in GRRN genes, laying the foundation for vulnerability to psychopathology, including post-traumatic stress symptom severity, depression symptom severity, and generalized anxiety symptom severity. This proposal brings together a strong investigative team with extensive expertise in social epidemiology, epigenetics, PTSD, and AA health. Our team will leverage data from a comprehensive, population based cohort study of mental health in AAs, the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study (DNHS). Results will be replicated using data from two independent cohorts, the Grady Trauma Project and the Predictive Biomarkers of PTSD Project. In addition, in vitro cell culture experiments will be leveraged to test GRRN dysregulation in neuronal cell lines, and will test the functional significance of GRRN DNA methylation variation. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will characterize genome wide patterns of leukocyte DNA methylation in African American participants in the Detroit Neighborhood Health Study, a population-based study of mental disorders among adult Detroit residents. Analysis will be targeted toward glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network genes and will test the effects of social adversity on DNA methylation levels in this gene network. The proposed research will also prospectively compare trauma-exposed participants who either did or did not develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in order to test whether social adversity impacts longitudinal patterns of DNA methylation in stress response genes.",Epigenomic Predictors of PTSD and Traumatic Stress in an African American Cohort,9705735,R01MD011728,"['Adult ', ' adulthood

"Cortisol Synchrony in Adolescents and Their Parents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite their citizenship, over 3.2 million US-born Latino children of undocumented parents (i.e., those in “mixed-status families”) experience chronic stress associated with potential or actual forced deportation of their parents. Relative to US-born Latino children in documented-status families, US-born Latino children in mixed- status families are exposed to additional acute and chronic stressors placing them at elevated risk for substance use, anxiety and depression. The absence of research using direct assessment of family documentation status impedes the ability to determine structural burden of stress exposure and its health consequences. Further, chronic stress, such as the burden of deportation stress within immigrant families, can be culturally bound and standardized survey measures may not be indicative of the negative health impact that physiological stress has within the family environment. The objective of this study is to determine the potential mental and behavioral health vulnerabilities of US-born Latino adolescents (ages 12- 16) with undocumented parents. This will be done through a dyadic bio-behavioral project based on central principles of community– based research. The primary aim is to describe cortisol synchrony in Latino adolescent-parent dyads, and compare the synchrony profiles of dyads in mixed-status families with those in documented families. Aim 2 is to delineate variability in self-appraised stressors among mixed-status and documented-status US-born Latino adolescent-immigrant parent dyads. Aim 3 will describe the magnitude of correlations of cortisol synchrony with parent and adolescent self-appraised stressors and youth self-reports of substance use, anxiety, and depression. This study will enroll n=25 US-born Mexican adolescent-immigrant parent dyads from mixed-status families and n=25 US-born Mexican adolescent-immigrant parent dyads from documented-status families who reside in the Houston-area. Direct assessments and self-reported surveys will be utilized. Saliva samples will be assayed for cortisol. Adolescents and parents will report on deportation stress, acculturative stress (SAFE- R), and economic stress (HSI-A and HSI-2 subscales). Adolescents will also report on substance use, anxiety (PAI), and depression (CES-D). This study is highly innovative for three reasons: (1) Explicit focus on a dominant contemporary issue – the management of US-born children and their undocumented immigrant parents – advanced under the previous administration but currently being called into question; (2) While there is a long history of studies focused on individuals' diurnal pattern of cortisol, there is a dearth of research using a dyadic bio-behavioral approach to capture cortisol synchrony among adolescent-immigrant parent households; and (3) A refinement in methodologies by using complementary objective and subjective assessments of stress to avoid potential ambiguity in health effects, recognizing that deportation stress is culturally bound. This study has implications to inform future community-based research projects focused on US-born children of undocumented immigrant parents, one of the fastest growing segments of the US. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stress association with potential or actual forced deportation is currently high; yet there is little scientific evidence for quantifying this burden within family units of US-born Latino children with an undocumented parent (i.e. “mixed-status” family). Using a dyadic bio-behavioral approach, this study will describe the cortisol synchrony of US-born children in mixed-status families to that of US-born children in documented-status families. This type research is needed because the 3.2 million US-born children of immigrant Latinos are one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population, and are at elevated risk for experiencing poor mental and behavioral health because of the stress within the family environment associated with deportation policies.",Cortisol Synchrony in Adolescents and Their Parents,9723359,R03HD098379,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Disclosure ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Household ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' insight ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Documentation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R03,2019,78749,0.04042194168040708
"The effects of lifetime stress on cognitive aging in the context of HIV-infection: Identifying sources of racial disparities Project Summary  Racial disparities exist in cognitive aging, and it has been established that long-term HIV disease accelerates cognitive aging processes. African Americans (AAs) are a particularly vulnerable group, and our preliminary data indicate that HIV+ AAs demonstrate worse cognitive and brain imaging outcomes than HIV+ EAs even after controlling for confounding factors. We do not know if these disparities persist over time, and the reasons for racial disparities in cognitive outcomes remains unclear. It is well-known that lifetime exposure to stress, which is associated with HIV-infection and AA race, influences cognitive outcomes. Thus, we hypothesize that lifetime stress is a mechanism that places HIV+ AAs at risk for poor cognitive outcomes. Peripheral inflammation has been linked to cognitive impairment in several studies, and is increased in association with HIV, AA race, and lifetime stress. Prospective studies are needed to determine if HIV, lifetime stress exposure and AA race results in premature cognitive aging via increased inflammation. The present study will address this gap in knowledge by examining rates of change in cognitive function and cortical and subcortical brain structures in a cohort of 250 older adults (50+) with and without HIV infection stratified by ethnicity (AA vs. EA). We will also address the gaps in the current stress and disparities literature by using a comprehensive measure of stress and adversity over the lifespan (i.e., Stress and Adversity Inventory [STRAIN]). The STRAIN will allow us to capture stressors that have occurred over an individual's lifetime as well as new stressors during the course of the study. We will examine how recent stress exposure is associated with changes in inflammation and cognitive/brain outcomes. This study is highly significant, as no study to date has examined racial disparities in risk for cognitive declines in HIV-seropositive individuals.  We will use state-of-the art methods for measuring brain changes by following up on a cohort of older (aged 50+) HIV+ and HIV- individuals from a previous NIH supported study. Structural neuroimaging will be used to examine longitudinal changes in morphometry and regional connectivity. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the prospective change in brain/cognitive function in HIV+ and HIV- adults stratified by AA and EA race. Our secondary aim is to determine how lifetime stress differs as a function of HIV status and race. Our third aim will examine how life stress is associated with prospective changes in cognition/brain structure. Finally, we will examine associations between recent life stress and changes in inflammation, and how these changes in inflammation influence cognitive/brain outcomes. This project brings together the skills of several research groups at UCLA, and builds upon existing collaborations and resources. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to evaluate cognitive aging in a large cohort of HIV+ and HIV- AA and EA older adults. At the end of this study we expect to discern the relative contributions of AA and HIV-specific processes as these unfold via inflammatory processes that increase vulnerability to premature aging. Project Narrative  Racial disparities exist in the context of HIV-infection; of particular importance is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. African Americans (with and without HIV) are more likely than European Americans to demonstrate poor cognitive outcomes, but the reasons are unclear. This novel project integrates methods of neuroscience and immunology to determine whether HIV-infection and African American race confer risks for cognitive impairments, and whether poor cognitive outcomes result from stress exposure and inflammation.",The effects of lifetime stress on cognitive aging in the context of HIV-infection: Identifying sources of racial

"Longevity and Stress in African American Families Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this application is to identify patterns of perceived stress, active coping style, health status and genes that contribute to longevity observed within African American families. We will examine these factors using vertical and horizontal approaches by studying similarities between siblings and parent-child pairs. To this end, we have the following questions:  1) Do familial effects (genes and shared environments) create similarity in the patterns of perceived tress and coping within and across generations?  2) Does stress account for differences in patterns of longevity between families?  3) Do psychosocial factors like stress, coping, and discrimination account for differences in patterns of health status and longevity between families?  4) What role do genes play in patterns of stress and longevity?  5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? To address these research questions, we have planned five specific aims: 1) Collect data from 750 older African Americans on perceptions of stress, discrimination, coping style, health, personality and genetics from multi-generation families (parent-child and siblings). 2) Examine similarities and differences in stress and coping, and health status among sibling pairs and across generations within families. 3) Compare the health status of siblings concordant for higher stress and poorer coping to those with lower stress and better coping. 4) Examine genes associated with stress and longevity in comparisons of long lived families and short lived families and among sibling pairs. 5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? This project is novel and innovative in that it will employ a multi method approach to understand longevity. It will use a quantitative genetic approach, a molecular genetic approach, and a multi generation approach. To our knowledge, this is the first time all of these methods have been employed on one sample. Relevance/Project Narrative This project will significantly contribute to our understanding the biobehavioral complex of factors that leads to healthy aging by examining genetic and environmental factors related to stress. ",Longevity and Stress in African American Families,9745495,R01AG054363,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Personality ', ' Play ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Siblings ', ' Stress ', ' survivorship ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Survivors ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' longevity gene ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Heritability ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' genetic approach ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' perceived stress ', ' mortality risk ', ' death risk ', ' ']",NIA,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,720389,0.14043991092693303
"Testing a Biopsychosocial Model of Minority Stress and Health for HIV-Positive Men Project Summary Gay and bisexual men (GBM) in the U.S. are burdened by a high and disproportionate rate of HIV infection and more than half of all HIV+ individuals are GBM. Improving viral load (VL) suppression is associated with a significant reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV. Moreover, research is needed to better understand the modifiable social and behavioral factors that influence their long-term health. Chronic experiences of sexual minority stressors (e.g., internalized homonegativity) have been shown to influence a variety of mental, behavioral, and physical health outcomes for GBM, including general stress (e.g., cortisol) and immune (e.g., cytokines) outcomes, as well as HIV-specific health outcomes (e.g., CD4 count) among HIV+ GBM. Chronic experiences of HIV-related stressors have also been shown to impact mental health and health behaviors for HIV+ GBM, though there is substantially less research on their role in the health of HIV+ GBM. Previous research, including our own, has shown that fluctuations in sexual minority and HIV-specific stressors (i.e., acute experiences of these stressors) are measurable and meaningfully associated with health outcomes. Both HIV infection and substance use are associated with declines in neurocognitive function and emerging evidence suggests that emotional processing may help explain the impact of psychological phenomena on health outcomes. To develop interventions that are robust and durable, research is needed that examines the unique and overlapping influence of sexual minority and HIV-related stressors on health outcomes for HIV+ GBM within a unified biopsychosocial model. Such a model should take into account both individual-level (i.e., chronic) and situational (i.e., acute) experiences of these stressors to examine their independent associations with health, and should consider whether emotional interference in cognitive processing might moderate these associations. Aim 1 of the study is to test a biopsychosocial model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress and health, examining direct and indirect effects of these stressors on each outcome. Aim 2 is to test the moderating role of emotional interference in cognitive processing on these associations. Finally, Aim 3 is to examine the extent of intraindividual variability over one year in sexual minority and HIV-related stressors, VL, CD4, and cytokines. Although not an aim, the study will culminate in the development of guidelines for future intervention development and we will gather participant feedback on these recommendations. To accomplish these aims, we will enroll 250 HIV+ GBM and follow them for 12 months. We will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over one year to test the impact of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on physiological stress (diurnal cortisol) and long-term immune outcomes (VL suppression, CD4 count, cytokines). This study will address novel questions about the relative role of sexual minority and HIV-related stress in the health of HIV+ GBM to guide the development of interventions to improve health and reduce HIV transmission, morbidity, and mortality among HIV+ GBM. Project Narrative Sexual minority stress is an established contributor to poorer behavioral, mental, and physical health for gay and bisexual men, though the role of HIV-related stress within these models has gone largely unexplored. We will test a unified model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on biomarkers of physiological stress (i.e., cortisol) and immune (i.e., viral load, CD4, cytokines) responses using twice-daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over 12 months to prospectively test the proposed model. We will use self-reported surveys and neurocognitive assessments to quantitatively examine the impact of these stressors on HIV-related health outcomes, and end by developing guidelines to inform the development of future interventions aimed at improving HIV treatment and prevent HIV transmission.",Testing a Biopsychosocial Model of Minority Stress and Health for HIV-Positive Men,9745321,R01MH114735,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Incidence ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', ' role men ', ' male role ', "" Men's Role "", ' working memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Short-Term Memory ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Minority Stress Reactivity and Hazardous Drinking PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disparities in hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been documented across several disadvantaged groups (e.g., racial/ethnic and sexual minorities). Hazardous drinking and its consequences are a major public health priority and concern given their significant economic, mortality, and morbidity burdens. Stigma and discrimination-related stressors (i.e., minority stressors) contribute to our understanding of health disparities among these groups. Given the importance of minority stressors in predicting hazardous drinking, the research aims of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) are to conduct a rigorous, innovative, and multi-method examination of minority stress and its effects on drinking in the lab and the natural environment among one disadvantaged health disparities group. Sexual minority (SM; i.e., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) adults are at increased risk for hazardous drinking compared to heterosexuals. SMs experience minority stressors, which range from daily and momentary slights to more acute forms of stigma, and are directly correlated with hazardous drinking. However, major limitations of the extant SM literature include the lack of objective measures of reactivity to minority stressors (i.e., biological markers), overreliance on cross-sectional data, and failure to account for individual differences in appraisals of minority stress or the contributions of minority stress on hazardous drinking beyond individual differences in daily general stress and lifetime cumulative stress. In addition, little is known about mediating mechanisms between minority stress and hazardous drinking. Consistent with Institute of Medicine and NIH’s call to expand the scientific knowledge base on factors contributing to SMs’ elevated rates of drinking, the research aims of this K08 are to: 1) examine the effects of psychophysiological mechanisms underpinning appraised minority stress and alcohol craving in a lab experiment of 70 SMs who are at most risk for developing AUD (i.e., heavy drinkers); and 2) use experience sampling methods (i.e., EMA) over a 30-day period, to examine: a) the effects of psychophysiological stress reactivity from the lab on minority stress reactivity and drinking in the natural environment and b) the prospective effects of minority stress on proximal changes in affect and drinking and its consequences in real time. While conducting this research and participating in several training and mentorship activities, the K08 candidate will develop new expertise in: 1) experimental laboratory research; 2) psychophysiological stress research and salivary research methodology; 3) experience sampling field methods (i.e., EMA); and 4) advanced statistical approaches for analyzing intensive longitudinal EMA quantitative data and physiological salivary laboratory data. This proposed project builds upon the candidate’s past work examining the associations between minority stressors and health outcomes among sexual and racial/ethnic minorities. Completion of this K08 award will provide the candidate necessary skills to be an independent researcher capable of advancing our knowledge of stress-specific factors predicting hazardous drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Sexual minorities (SMs; i.e., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) are at increased risk for hazardous drinking, alcohol- related consequences, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) than heterosexuals. Hazardous drinking and its consequences are a major public health concern given resulting economic, societal, mortality, and morbidity burdens. The project will address how SMs’ experiences with stigma-based stressors related to their sexual orientation (i.e., minority stressors) are associated with hazardous drinking in order to inform and develop alcohol interventions and improve the well-being of SMs.",Minority Stress Reactivity and Hazardous Drinking,9755274,K08AA025011,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Award ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' Bisexual ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' System ', ' alcohol craving ', ' ethanol craving ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' drinking ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' alcohol intervention ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' alcohol related consequences ', ' public health priorities ', ' sexual minority ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' lab experiment ', ' lab assignment ', ' prospective test ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' individual variation ', ' individual variability ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NIAAA,AMERICAN UNIVERSITY,K08,2019,169287,0.054046268566919894
"Caregiving burden and heart rate variability: Differences by race/ethnicity and gender Project Summary/Abstract This application is a Diversity Supplement to parent grant R01 NR016817-01 (2016-2020), “Tailored health self-management interventions for highly distressed family caregivers” (J.A. Zauszniewski, PI). Two years of predoctoral research training and support is requested for an outstanding minority candidate, Ms. Elizabeth Williams, BSN, RN. Ms. Williams plans to study the relationships among caregiver characteristics (i.e. race/ethnicity and gender) and stress responses (psychological and physiological) in family caregivers of adults with bipolar disorder. The specific aims for the supplement project are to: 1) determine whether there are differences by caregiver characteristics (race/ethnicity and gender) on measures of psychological stress responses (self-reported involvement in care and caregiving burden); 2) determine whether there are differences by caregiver characteristics (race/ethnicity and gender) on measures of physiological stress responses (heart rate variability: time and frequency domains – eight indicators); 3) examine associations among all of the indicators of psychological and physiological stress responses; and 4) explore relationships among available indicators of the time and frequency domains of heart rate variability. Under the mentorship of Dr. Jaclene A. Zauszniewski and the other co-investigators of the parent grant, Ms. Williams will engage in a set of formal and informal research activities related to the understanding of health disparities and caregiver stress, with a specific interest in disentangling differences on psychological and physiological measures of stress responses, and particularly, the time and frequency domains of heart rate variability. Her study will concentrate on measures obtained at baseline on demographic characteristics, and psychological and physiological stress on all study participants (N=300), who are family caregivers of persons with bipolar disorder. This Diversity Supplement addresses research priorities of the NINR to develop a diverse cadre of nurse scientists to advance the science of caregiving and health disparities. Ms. Williams' involvement in the parent clinical trial will provide invaluable experiences for her as she progresses towards her goal of acquiring the necessary mentoring, substantive knowledge, and scientific training that will set her apart among her peers with unique knowledge and expertise in the areas of health disparities, caregiver stress, and heart rate variability. Project Narrative Research suggests that the mostly highly distressed family caregivers are those who provide care and support for persons with unpredictable and challenging illness trajectories, such as those with bipolar disorder. The psychological and physiological stress associated with caregiving is intensified by stress associated with being a caregiver who does not represent the dominant culture (i.e. White women). Our findings will generate new scientific knowledge about the stress experienced by White and non-White, male and female caregivers of adults with bipolar disorder, using previously untapped measures of heart rate variability to capture their stress.",Caregiving burden and heart rate variability: Differences by race/ethnicity and gender,9755677,R01NR016817,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Bipolar Disorder ', ' manic depressive illness ', ' manic depressive disorder ', ' bipolar disease ', ' bipolar affective disorder ', ' Manic-Depressive Psychosis ', ' Bipolar Affective Psychosis ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Statistical Correlation ', ' Correlation Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Female ', ' financial assistance ', ' Financial Support ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' nurse ', ' Nurses ', ' Parents ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Generations ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Family Care Giver ', ' Family Caregiver ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Caring ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Manic ', ' Manic State ', ' Manias ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' hospital readmission ', ' rehospitalization ', ' readmission ', ' re-hospitalization ', ' re-admission ', ' hospital re-admission ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' behavioral health ', ' career development ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Adverse effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' International ', ' Research Training ', ' Characteristics ', ' early onset ', ' caregiving ', ' care giving ', ' disability-adjusted life years ', ' DALY ', ' care burden ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' care giving burden ', ' caregiving stress ', ' caregiving burden ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Affective ', ' parent grant ', ' heart rate variability ', ' primary care services ', ' sociodemographics ', ' socio-demographics ', ' ']",NINR,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,42105,0.10864288174473528
"PA-18-591 Religiosity, Spirituality, Stress, Health and Mortality among Middle to Old Age Black Men (Supplement to Stress and Mortality Among Black Men) PROJECT SUMMARY Black men experience extremely high levels of social and psychological stress from unfavorable social and economic circumstances emerging from institutional discrimination and unfair treatment. Early exposure to stress and its rapid accumulation over the lifecourse can contribute to disproportionate risks for illness, disease and premature mortality among this population. The three-hit concept (hit 1: genetic predisposition; hit 2: early- life environment; hit 3: later-life environment) suggests that the poor health of Black men may be a function of interactions between cumulative stress, epigenetic mechanisms, and biological responses. Religiosity and spirituality have been found to impact health and the objective of this study is to examine how religiosity (practices associated with organized religion) and spirituality (individuals experiences with, awareness of, and connection to the transcendent) impact stress and its implications for improving the well-being and longevity of middle to old age Black men. This proposed study will use data from the Healthy Aging in Neighborhoods of Diversity Across the Life Span Study (HANDLS) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to specify models guided by a biopsychosocial perspective. The specific aims are to: 1) Investigate the independent associations of religiosity and spirituality on psychological and behavioral responses to stress, functional status, and mortality; 2) Investigate the interdependent relationships of religiosity and spirituality on psychological and behavioral responses to stress, functional status, and mortality; and 3) Examine the impact of religiosity and spirituality on biological and genomic markers to elucidate potential basic mechanisms through which they mediate the relationship between stress and mortality. Results from the proposed project will advance our understanding of religion and spirituality on health in the group most vulnerable to premature death. In addition, the proposed research will be used to inform subsequent studies focusing on the health benefits of religiosity and spirituality among Black men that can lead to religious and spiritual interventions which are highly scalable not only to Black men but potentially all racial/ethnic groups and genders, and at low/no cost. PROJECT NARRATIVE Black men can anticipate to have life expectancies that are at least 6 years shorter than any other group of women or men; however, few studies have examined stress and related pathways leading to disease development, disability and premature mortality among this group and even fewer have considered factors that disrupt them. This project seeks to examine how religiosity and spirituality impact stress and its implications for improving the well-being and longevity of middle to old age Black men. Findings will be used to inform subsequent research objectives associated with the development of highly-scalable and cost-efficient solutions to improve health among Black men.","PA-18-591 Religiosity, Spirituality, Stress, Health and Mortality among Middle to Old Age Black Men (Supplement to Stress and Mortality Among Black Men)",9755819,K02AG059140,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aging ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' telomere ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' premature ', ' prematurity ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Link ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' disability ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Individual ', ' Premature Mortality ', "" Women's Group "", ' Female Groups ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic etiology ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Exposure to ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' functional status ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Independent Scientist Award ', ' K02 Award ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' To specify ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' cost ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' cost efficient ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' male health ', "" men's health "", ' racial and ethnic ', ' healthy aging ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' coping mechanism ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral economics ', ' genomic biomarker ', ' genomic marker ', ' minority investigator ', ' Health and Retirement Study ', ' economic determinant ', ' ']",NIA,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,K02,2019,69228,0.08207273212378001
"Stress, Epigenetics and Aging Project Summary There is extensive evidence that socioeconomic status (SES) and social stressors shape the development of numerous chronic conditions and aging-related illnesses. However, the processes through which SES and social stress affect biological processes related to aging and disease development have not been fully elucidated, particularly at the cellular level. This is important to investigate among African Americans who have higher mortality, shorter lifespan, and experience a disproportionate burden of disease than whites. Research examining associations between stressors and biological aging processes have been predominately cross- sectional in nature and have included predominately racially and ethnically homogenous samples. No prior studies have assessed the independent and cumulative impact of SES and stress at multiple time points across the life course in relation to biomarkers of aging (e.g. telomere length, DNA methylation age). Furthermore, little is know as to whether behavioral and psychological factors mediate the association between stress and biological aging processes, and whether forms of resilience (e.g., coping response, social support) may modify these associations. We propose to leverage existing data from the Disparities (DISPAR) study to examine the relationship between stressors and resilience across the life course in relation to biological aging processes. The DISPAR study conducted a 50-year follow-up of women who participated in a pregnancy cohort between 1959 and 1957 in Alameda County, California. Subsets of offspring were followed at ages 5 y, 9-11 y, 15-17y, and 50 years. The DISPAR sample includes a representative subsample (n=605) of these children interviewed as adults (mean age of 50 years), 42% African-American and 50% female. Validated measures of negative life events, discrimination, caregiving stress, mental health, social support, and coping mechanisms among others were collected. In addition, anthropometric measures, blood pressure and a blood sample were collected. For this study (N=372), we propose to assay existing stored blood collected at age 50 for biomarkers of biological aging (telomere length, methylation age). We will examine the role of childhood and adult SES and psychosocial stressors (e.g. child adversity, caregiving stress, job stress, racial discrimination) on telomere length and methylation age in adulthood. Additionally, we propose to examine behavioral (e.g. physical activity, smoking) and psychological (e.g. distress) responses to stress as potential mediators of these associations, and positive and negative coping factors as potential modifiers of the associations between SES, stress and biological processes. Given that half of our sample is African-American, we will have the opportunity to assess how stress, resilience-based factors, and associated biological aging processes differ by race. Completion of this project would allow us to elucidate important biological, genetic, and epigenetic pathways that help explain how stress and resilience shapes population health disparities among aging populations. Project Narrative Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress are increasingly recognized as important factors that shape the development of chronic diseases and aging-related illnesses, particularly among African Americans, who experience a disproportionate burden of disease. However, the pathways through which stress affects obesity the biological pathways related to health disparities are not fully understood, particularly at the cellular level, and most research to date has been cross-sectional and among samples that lack racial diversity. We propose to address these gaps by examining the independent and cumulative impact of both SES and social stress at multiple points across the life course in relation to DNA methylation (e.g. DNA methylation age, genome-wide methylation) and telomere length among a diverse sample of whites and African Americans, as well as forms of resilience and coping in response to these stressors.","Stress, Epigenetics and Aging",9725876,R01AG058704,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect

"Stress-reduction Wellness Program for Midlife Black Women (B-SWELL) Project Summary/Abstract  Chronic life stress is an antecedent to chronic illnesses like cardiovascular disease. The multitude of competing chronic stressors experienced by midlife Black women contribute to the striking disparities in cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality in comparison to midlife White American women. These same stressors also decrease the likelihood that Black women will adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors as they diminish the time and energy available for self-care. Physiological and psychological responses to social and environmental stressors are uniquely influenced by a population's history, perceptions, and culture. The intersection between ethnicity, culture, environment, and health is complex and requires tailored and targeted approaches that account for population differences to improve health outcomes. Recognition and improved understanding of these potential differences is important to provide culturally appropriate care.  The purpose of this research is to develop a midlife Black women's Stress-reduction WELLness intervention, B-SWELL, to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors based on the stressors and themes identified in the candidate's preliminary research. Community-based participatory research (CBPR) methods will be used to engage the community and include midlife Black women in the development of the B-SWELL. The hypothesis proposes that B-SWELL participants (n=25) will show improved self-efficacy in managing life stress and adopting American Heart Association's Life Simple 7 Success Plan (LS7 behaviors), compared with participants randomized to a control group receiving traditional wellness education (WE group) (n=25). Secondary outcomes include unhealthy days, perceived general health and depressive symptoms. Data collection will occur at baseline, 8 weeks (end of intervention), and 12 weeks. LS7 has been shown to decrease cardiovascular disease risk but lacks culturally appropriate characteristics to improve its appeal to midlife Black women.  The candidate, Dr. Jones, has expertise in stress research with a focus on chronic life stress in midlife Black women. In an effort to develop an effective intervention for midlife Black women, the candidate assembled a mentoring team of experts to guide her training in intervention research and community-based participatory research methods (CBPR). Dr. Jones' short-term goal is to become an independent stress researcher skilled in the use of methodologies and techniques required for intervention research and CBPR. This K01 award will serve as a platform from which Dr. Jones will build a body of stress research focused on chronic disease prevention in midlife Black women. The resources, time, and, materials needed for this project are available through the University of Cincinnati (UC) and the College of Nursing. In addition, the UC Center for Clinical & Translational Training and Science offers services for K01 awardees in the effort to foster junior researchers. Project Narrative This research is relevant to public health because it studies the unique cultural and gender- based factors that influence how midlife Black women experience stress and incorporate healthy lifestyle behaviors into daily life. In this ever-changing and diverse society, our ability to provide individualized and culturally appropriate interventions, like the B-SWELL, is important. The proposed B-SWELL intervention has the potential to elucidate the complex relationship between stress and behavior and affect existing cardiovascular health disparities.",Stress-reduction Wellness Program for Midlife Black Women (B-SWELL),9822521,K01HL141676,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Americas ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' Data Collection ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Perception ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Shoulder ', ' Smoking ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Voice ', ' Wellness Program ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racism ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Fostering ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Services ', ' environmental stressor ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Deterioration ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Life Stress ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' prototype ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' secondary outcome ', ' fasting glucose ', ' coping mechanism ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' healthy life-style ', ' attentional control ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' recruit ', ' stress reduction ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI,K01,2019,161028,0.08833687490669581
"Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women Project Summary Significance: Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian/gay and bisexual (LGB) women report higher rates of physical health problems. Current evidence, which is largely based on self-report, suggests that important health disparities exist in conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). To date, however, no study has tested differences in objective measures of health risks between LGB and heterosexual women in a representative sample of young adults. We aim to fill this gap by examining putative health disparities using rigorous objective biomarkers of health (i.e. cardiometabolic functioning and inflammation) in young adulthood in a representative, racially diverse sample of young women who are participating in an ongoing longitudinal study, the Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS) (Aim 1). We will link prospectively gathered data on discrimination stress and childhood adversity to determine the role of stress exposure in the association between sexual minority status and early adult health (Aim 2). Finally, we will test whether health promotion during adolescence attenuates the association between discrimination stress and health risks among LGB women (Aim 3). Approach: Our plan is to leverage comprehensive, prospectively collected data from the PGS and measure current health indicators among LGB women in the PGS (n=230) and a demographic frequency matched sample of heterosexual women (n=230) in early adulthood (ages 22-25 years). Assessments of health will include: waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, cholesterol, fatty acids, glucose, insulin, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6; TNF-α), and C-reactive protein. We propose to assess discrimination stress via cortisol and heart rate reactivity to a lab- based discrimination stressor and perceived discrimination experiences measured annually and prospectively from ages 15 to 21 years. Childhood adversity (family stress, trauma, abuse, and peer victimization) has been assessed annually for in the PGS from youth and caregiver reports. Physical and emotional health promotion during adolescence has been assessed in a number of ways in the PGS including vaccine uptake, safe sexual practices, and physical activity, supportive adult presence, and will be complemented by interviews on school climate and coming out experiences. Investigators: Dr. Kathryn Keenan is the Principal Investigator, Drs. Alison Hipwell, Stephanie Stepp, Karen Matthews, Alicia Matthews and Alida Bouris are Co-Investigators, and Ms. Kristen Wroblewski is the biostatistician. Dr. Constance Hammen is the consultant. The investigators have led many successful NIH-funded studies and represent expertise in developmental psychopathology, women's mental health, sexual minority physical and mental health, health psychology, and biostatistics. Collectively, the investigators have experience in administering the TSST to vulnerable populations, measuring cortisol reactivity, and testing hypotheses involving cardiometabolic and inflammatory functioning. Environment: This proposal builds on long-standing, productive collaborations among investigators at the Universities of Chicago, Illinois, and Pittsburgh. Innovation/Impact: The proposed study provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore health disparities in LGB women in a rigorous manner, examine potential mechanisms by which sexual orientation confers health risks, and identify protective factors in a representative and racially diverse sample of LGB and heterosexual women. Project Narrative The goals of the proposed study are to test whether LGB women differ significantly from heterosexual women on objective biomarkers of health and identify mechanisms by which sexual minority women are at heightened risk for compromised health. It is hypothesized that discrimination stress and childhood stressors have adverse effects on metabolic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular systems that maintain health. The proposal also aims to identify health promotion behaviors that mitigate these associations to inform tailored preventive and intervention approaches for at-risk women.",Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women,9822015,R01HL137246,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chicago ', ' Cholesterol ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Illinois ', ' Inflammation ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Addressing Provider Stress and Unconscious Bias to Improve Quality of Maternal Health Care PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This Pathway to Independence Award (K99/R00) will facilitate my transition to an independent scientist who conducts innovative research on the social, structural, and health system drivers of maternal and child health (MCH) disparities, and translates the findings into practical interventions that will reduce disparities and improve MCH outcomes. The activities described in this proposal are aimed at addressing health care provider stress and unconscious bias to improve quality of maternal health care, particularly the person-centered dimensions. Poor person-centered maternal health care (PCMHC) contributes to high maternal and neonatal mortality in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and disparities in PCMHC are driving disparities in use of maternal health services. Little research, however, exists on how to improve PCMHC and reduce disparities. I seek to fill this gap with this project. I propose targeting health provider stress and unconscious bias as fundamental factors driving poor PCMHC and disparities in PCMHC. Health provider stress and unconscious bias are important to consider because: (1) providers in low-resource settings often work under very stressful conditions; (2) unconscious bias is prevalent in every society including SSA; and (3) these factors are mutually reinforcing drivers of poor quality care and disparities in person-centered care. To prepare me to develop my unique research program and extend the evidence base on interventions to improve PCMHC, I propose training and research during the mentored phase (K99) to extend my knowledge and skills in: (1) stress and unconscious bias; (2) advanced qualitative and mixed methods research; and (3) implementation science methodology. In the K99 phase, I will also conduct (1) multilevel secondary data analysis to examine individual level characteristics and potential system level stressors associated with PCMHC, focusing on the role of provider stress; and (2) structured and in-depth interviews with providers to examine the levels of provider stress and unconscious bias, and the types of stressors and biases in Kenya. The knowledge and skills gained in the mentored phase, as well as the results of the mentored research, will be instrumental to achieving the aims of the independent phase (R00), which are to: (1) design a multicomponent theory and evidence-based intervention that enables providers to identify and manage their stress and unconscious bias; (2) pilot the intervention to assess its feasibility and acceptability; and (3) assess preliminary effect of the intervention on: (a) provider knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to stress and unconscious bias; and (b) provider stress levels—using a pretest-posttest control group design. I will use the results of the pilot to refine the intervention and develop an R01 proposal for a multi-site evaluation with a larger sample and longer follow up, to assess impact on PCMHC. My mentorship and consulting team is uniquely poised to assist me in achieving my training and research goals, and to ensure my successful transition to an independent investigator. PROJECT NARRATIVE Of the estimated 800 pregnancy-related deaths that occur daily, about two-thirds occur in sub-Saharan Africa, and for every woman who dies, about 20 others suffer various disabilities.

"An Interpersonal Relationships Intervention for Improving Cardiovascular Health in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY Disparities in cardiovascular (CV) diseases by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity are pronounced in our society, and the processes that lead to these disparities begin in childhood. Previous intervention efforts have targeted individual lifestyle changes in health behaviors, but with limited success in low SES, minority youth. We propose a novel intervention to reduce CV risk in low SES, minority children (under 21 by NIH guidelines) that focuses on social relationships – specifically mentoring – as a way to create bi-directional benefits for CV health in youth. The rationale for this intervention is based both on work showing that receiving social support has benefits for physical health, and on work demonstrating that helping others is associated with better physical health. In this proposed intervention study, college students will serve as mentors to elementary school students (8th graders). 250 college students and 250 Chicago Public School 8th graders will be randomized to either serve as a mentor/mentee or to be in a control group. Students will participate in a weekly mentoring intervention throughout one school year. Assessments will occur at 3 time points during the school year. All mentors and mentees will come from low-income families and underrepresented minority groups, thus allowing us to focus on improving CV health in an at-risk population that experiences a disproportionate share of the CV burden in the U.S. The first aim of the project is to investigate whether mentors can reduce CV risk (obesity; blood pressure; cholesterol; blood glucose) in low-income, minority youth mentees relative to a control group of 8th graders. The second aim is to investigate whether serving as a mentor can reduce CV risk in the college student mentors compared to a control group of college students. The third aim is to understand how mentoring influences the intervention targets of psychosocial, health behavior, and biological variables, and whether these variables mediate the impact of mentoring on CV health. Drawing from the stress buffering model of social support, we propose that mentoring fosters the development of strong social relationships that can scaffold behavioral changes and hence mitigate the effects that stress has on inflammation and CV health via 2 pathways: psychophysiological and health behaviors. In the psychophysiological pathway, mentoring creates more adaptive cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to life stressors, which in turn mitigate responses of the sympathetic and neuroendocrine systems to stress. Over time, this reduces inflammation and improves CV health. In the health behaviors pathway, the scaffolding from mentoring relationships mitigates the associations of stress with detrimental health behaviors that in turn are linked to both inflammation and CV health. Through this study, we take a social relationships- oriented primary prevention approach to reducing health disparities by targeting CV risk factors that emerge early in life and that predict clinical CV disease outcomes into adulthood and by focusing on low-income, minority mentors and mentees who represent an at-risk, underserved, and disadvantaged group of youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT This project will implement a mentoring intervention pairing low-income minority college students as mentors to low-income minority elementary school students, and investigate the effects of mentoring on the cardiovascular health of both mentees and mentors. From a single intervention, we have the potential to create cardiovascular health benefits among both younger youth (mentees) and older youth (mentors) simultaneously through a novel approach that focuses on the beneficial influences that a social relationship between a mentor and mentee can have in helping to scaffold positive behavioral changes. This project takes a primary prevention approach by focusing on cardiovascular risk factors that emerge during childhood and as well, targets health disparities by focusing on an at-risk group of

"SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to experience negative health outcomes the longer they live in the U.S. For example, over time Hispanic immigrants engage in riskier behaviors such as substance abuse, violence, and risky sex, and experience more depressive symptoms. The stress associated with the acculturation process, acculturation stress, and resilience at the individual, family, community, and societal levels appear to play important roles in influencing risks. However, little is known about the causal mechanisms linking acculturation stress, resilience, and health outcomes among Hispanic immigrants. Further, little is known about what precise types of stressors (e.g., occupational stress vs. discrimination) and resilience factors (e.g., individual coping vs. family support) have the most important influence on health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants. The proposed longitudinal study (N = 385) will investigate the effects of acculturation stress and resilience on co-occurring substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV risk, and depression (i.e., syndemic conditions) and biological stress among young adult Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. More specifically, the proposed project aims to: 1) test theoretical links between the cumulative impact of acculturation stress and resilience on syndemic conditions and biological stress among recent young adult Hispanic immigrants over a two-year period, and 2) identify the specific types of acculturation stressors and resilience factors at the individual, family, community, and societal levels that are most important in predicting syndemic conditions and biological stress among this population over time. Young adult low-income Hispanic immigrant men and women within the first 10 years of immigration will be followed for two years. Biopsychosocial data will be collected from participants at baseline, and then 6 months (FU1), 12 months (FU2), 18 months (FU3), and 24 months later (FU4). Culturally specific measures of acculturation stress and resilience will be used to assess for individual, family, community, and societal risk and protective factors for syndemic conditions. Blood and urine samples will be obtained from participants to measure systemic inflammation (IL 6, IL8, and IL 18) and oxidative stress (F2 isoprostanes), previously validated biomarkers for psychological stress. Various descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistics, including latent growth curve modeling, will be used to address aims 1-2. The findings from this study have the potential to identify risk and protective factors for the decay in heath among Hispanic immigrants. A precise and culturally informed understanding of these phenomena is foundational for designing interventions that can ultimately promote the health and wellbeing of Hispanic immigrants, the largest immigrant group in the U.S. This study also has the potential to lay the theoretical foundation for biopsychosocial health disparities research in other populations. RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study seeks to describe the impact that acculturation stress and resilience plays in influencing behavioral, psychological, and biological health among young adult Hispanics who are recent immigrants. The findings from this study can inform interventions aiming to improve the health and well-being of Hispanic immigrants.","SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S.",9852923,R01MD012249,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Immigration ', ' Inflammation ', ' Influentials ', ' Language ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Perception ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' IL8 gene ', ' b-ENAP ', ' TSG-1 ', ' SCYB8 ', ' MONAP ', ' MDNCF ', ' LYNAP ', ' LUCT ', ' K60 ', ' IL8 ', ' IL-8 ', ' GCP1 ', ' CXCL8 ', ' AMCF-I ', ' 3-10C ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' family support ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,82176,0.10393957536364046
"Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women Project Summary Significance: Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian/gay and bisexual (LGB) women report higher rates of physical health problems. Current evidence, which is largely based on self-report, suggests that important health disparities exist in conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). To date, however, no study has tested differences in objective measures of health risks between LGB and heterosexual women in a representative sample of young adults. We aim to fill this gap by examining putative health disparities using rigorous objective biomarkers of health (i.e. cardiometabolic functioning and inflammation) in young adulthood in a representative, racially diverse sample of young women who are participating in an ongoing longitudinal study, the Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS) (Aim 1). We will link prospectively gathered data on discrimination stress and childhood adversity to determine the role of stress exposure in the association between sexual minority status and early adult health (Aim 2). Finally, we will test whether health promotion during adolescence attenuates the association between discrimination stress and health risks among LGB women (Aim 3). Approach: Our plan is to leverage comprehensive, prospectively collected data from the PGS and measure current health indicators among LGB women in the PGS (n=230) and a demographic frequency matched sample of heterosexual women (n=230) in early adulthood (ages 22-25 years). Assessments of health will include: waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, cholesterol, fatty acids, glucose, insulin, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6; TNF-α), and C-reactive protein. We propose to assess discrimination stress via cortisol and heart rate reactivity to a lab- based discrimination stressor and perceived discrimination experiences measured annually and prospectively from ages 15 to 21 years. Childhood adversity (family stress, trauma, abuse, and peer victimization) has been assessed annually for in the PGS from youth and caregiver reports. Physical and emotional health promotion during adolescence has been assessed in a number of ways in the PGS including vaccine uptake, safe sexual practices, and physical activity, supportive adult presence, and will be complemented by interviews on school climate and coming out experiences. Investigators: Dr. Kathryn Keenan is the Principal Investigator, Drs. Alison Hipwell, Stephanie Stepp, Karen Matthews, Alicia Matthews and Alida Bouris are Co-Investigators, and Ms. Kristen Wroblewski is the biostatistician. Dr. Constance Hammen is the consultant. The investigators have led many successful NIH-funded studies and represent expertise in developmental psychopathology, women's mental health, sexual minority physical and mental health, health psychology, and biostatistics. Collectively, the investigators have experience in administering the TSST to vulnerable populations, measuring cortisol reactivity, and testing hypotheses involving cardiometabolic and inflammatory functioning. Environment: This proposal builds on long-standing, productive collaborations among investigators at the Universities of Chicago, Illinois, and Pittsburgh. Innovation/Impact: The proposed study provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore health disparities in LGB women in a rigorous manner, examine potential mechanisms by which sexual orientation confers health risks, and identify protective factors in a representative and racially diverse sample of LGB and heterosexual women. Project Narrative The goals of the proposed study are to test whether LGB women differ significantly from heterosexual women on objective biomarkers of health and identify mechanisms by which sexual minority women are at heightened risk for compromised health. It is hypothesized that discrimination stress and childhood stressors have adverse effects on metabolic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular systems that maintain health. The proposal also aims to identify health promotion behaviors that mitigate these associations to inform tailored preventive and intervention approaches for at-risk women.",Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women,9673773,R01HL137246,"['Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Chicago ', ' Cholesterol ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Illinois ', ' Inflammation ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lipids ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Sex differences in the neurochemical mechanisms by which a stress peptide enhances nicotine reward and withdrawal Project Abstract  Tobacco use remains a major public health problem, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term consequences of smoking. Unfortunately, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the underlying mechanisms by which stress promotes the behavioral effects of nicotine in females. The objective of this fellowship application is to investigate the role of stress systems in promoting nicotine reward and withdrawal in female rats. Our central hypothesis is that sex differences in the behavioral effects of nicotine are modulated via stress systems in the local circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a terminal region of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. The rationale for our hypothesis is based on our preliminary studies showing that viral- mediated over-expression of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) in the NAc selectively enhances the rewarding effects of nicotine in female versus male rats. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that sex differences in the behavioral effects of nicotine are modulated via inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (glutamate) amino acids that regulate dopamine release in the NAc. Thus, the proposed studies will examine sex differences in the neurochemical effects of nicotine in female and male rats that received over-expression of CRF in the NAc (Aim 1). We predict that activation of CRF1 receptors following CRF over-expression produces a decrease in GABA transmission that results in enhanced dopamine release in the NAc of female versus male rats. We will examine whether these effects are CRF1 receptor mediated by infusing the CRF1 receptor antagonist, antalarmin into the NAc during our dialysate collections. Subsequent studies will examine sex differences in the neurochemical effects of nicotine withdrawal in female and male rats that received over-expression of CRF in the NAc (Aim 2). We predict that CRF over-expression will exacerbate the neurochemical effects of nicotine withdrawal via the emergence of large increases in glutamate release onto GABAergic interneurons. We expect that this effect will lead to a larger increase in GABA release that will contribute to a larger decrease in NAc dopamine release in female versus male rats. The project will provide important information regarding the role of stress systems in the behavioral effects of nicotine.

Minority stress has been implicated as a key cause of health problems, and family functioning, emotion regulation, couple-level minority stress, and community contexts have been identified as potential mechanisms underlying these associations. Contemporary theoretical models have yet to be tested due to a lack of data, and further, this lack of data has made studies of the intersection of racial and ethnic minority stress with sexual and gender minority stress difficult. This project will produce the first population- representative, multi-method, fully-powered study of cohabiting and married sexual and gender minorities and their partners, and a comparison sample of cis-gender individuals in different-gender unions. Aim 1. Evaluate whether and how family functioning (e.g. relationship quality) mediates the negative effects of stress due to discrimination on physical and mental health and health behaviors. Aim 2. Using an experience sampling method embedded in a time-diary, examine 1) the mediating role of emotion regulation, and 2) dyadic stress processes in the association between stress and subsequent health behaviors and time-use among same- gender couples. Aim 3. Investigate the association between community-level factors including economic disadvantage, access to healthcare, and the sexual and gender minority political climate (i.e. state employment protections) and sexual and gender minorities’ physical and mental health and health behaviors. Aim 4. Determine race and ethnic health gaps among sexual [and gender] minorities and evaluate potential protective factors that may minimize these gaps. We will recruit 2690 US adults aged 18 to 60 who are cohabiting or married to same- and different-gender partners, along with their partners. The sample will include an oversample of respondents of color. Population-representative Gallup samples afford a unique and efficient opportunity to study sexual and gender minorities who are in unions via targeted sampling. Using a mobile phone application platform, we will also collect time-diary and experience sampling method data. The primary significance of this project is 1) the identification of family functioning and emotion regulation as mediators of sexual and gender minority stress due to stigma and discrimination and poor physical and psychological health and health behaviors, and 2) the collection of dyadic data that will elucidate dyadic minority stress processes. The proposed research is innovative because it is the first contemporary, population-representative study of sexual and gender minority health that includes family functioning, emotion regulation, and dyadic data and an oversample of racial and ethnic minorities. These data will help researchers better understand how to improve the health of sexual and gender minorities by illuminating potential mechanisms underlying health disparities. Data will be available to scholars across the world through ICPSR and the American Heritage Time Use Study. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because 1) the identification of family functioning and emotion regulation as mediators of sexual and gender minority stress due to stigma and discrimination and poor physical and psychological health and health behaviors, 2) the collection of dyadic data critical to testing dyadic minority stress processes, and 3) the examination of the intersection of sexual and gender minority stress and racial and ethnic minority stress, are ultimately expected to lead to new evidence-based interventions and policies designed to improve adult and child wellbeing across American family contexts. Overall, the primary positive impact will be evidence that will be applicable to clinical and community settings to set adults and children in the families of sexual and gender minorities on successful developmental trajectories. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to that part of the NICHD's mission that all Americans are able to develop to their full capability so that their lives, and intimate relationships, may be healthy, gratifying, and long.",Mechanisms Underlying Sexual Minority Health Disparities in the United States,9786087,R01HD094081,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' child wellbeing ', ' child well being ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' Child Welfare ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Climate ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Family dynamics ', ' Family Research ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Marriage ', ' Masks ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Method ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Respondent ', ' diaries ', ' Complex ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Family health status ', ' Family Health ', ' member ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Car Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' minority health ', ' time use ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' emotion regulation ', ' emotional regulation ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' community setting ', ' population based ', ' sexual minority ', ' cisgender ', ' cis-gender ', ' racial minority ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' intersectionality ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NICHD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,396688,0.05133594186921245
"Racial Disparities in Health: The Roles of Stress, Social Relations and the Cardiovascular System Hypertension is the number one cause of racial group disparities in mortality in the U.S. Thus, understanding the mechanisms by which race is linked with the cardiovascular system is key. African Americans (AA) are exposed to more stress across the lifespan and lifetime adversity is associated with cardiovascular disease (CHD) and hypertension. However, mechanisms accounting for the links between long-term stress exposure, hypertension and CHD remain unclear. Cardiovascular reactivity is hypothesized to be a major contender as it predicts increased risk of cardiac events and mortality, especially among people with hypertension. According to existing theories of racial health disparities, stress, and social relations, racial health disparities are due to variations in long-term exposure to stress and stress reactivity (biological, psychological, behavioral) and those race differences are moderated by social relations and age. In response to the FOA Aging Research on Stress and Resilience to Address Health Disparities in the United States (RFA-AG-16-022), the present study seeks to understand how long-term stress exposure links with stress reactivity among AA and EA adults. This study capitalizes the existing longitudinal Social Relations and Health Study (SRS),a regionally representative panel sample of AA and EA individuals from the Detroit metropolitan area who began participating in 1992 (ages 13 to 93) and completed the third wave in 2015 (ages 30 to 95). The proposed study will incorporates two new studies of short-term stress reactivity: 1) a daily stress study and 2) a laboratory stress study. The daily stress study will target 300 participants (50% AA; 50%EA) and will incorporate a 4 day experience sampling study of self-reported stress exposure and reactivity (psychological, behavioral) as well as two ambulatory monitoring devices to assess biological reactivity: 1) a newly developed non-invasive continuous monitoring ring device that provides estimates of vascular resistance and 2) a watch that assesses heart rate, heart rate variability, and galvanic skin response. In the laboratory study we will examine reactivity to standard laboratory stressors among a sample of 50 AA and 50 EA respondents who completed the daily stress study to examine more thoroughly their physiological responses to stress with the same ambulatory ring and watch as well as established continuous monitors. The proposed research addresses three aims: 1) Test links between long- term stress exposure and short-term stress reactivity among EA and AA adults, 2) Examine age differences in long-term stress exposure and short-term reactivity by race, and 3) Determine how long-term social relationships moderate individual differences in stress exposure and reactivity. This project has public health significance as it will identify individuals who are more reactive to stress and the immediate as well as lifespan factors that are associated with greater stress reactivity. A more nuanced understanding of the psychological and biological implications of stress among diverse populations will lead to the development and testing of interventions for reducing stress, later health problems, and health disparities. Project Narrative African Americans are more likely to develop hypertension and to die from hypertension than European Americans. This project seeks to understand how long term pattern of stress, social ties, and hypertension contribute to variations in stress exposure and stress reactivity in daily life. The project is particularly significant for public health as identifying individuals who are more reactive to stress may allow for the development of interventions targeting specific populations of individuals who are more at risk of further health problems and mortality.","Racial Disparities in Health: The Roles of Stress, Social Relations and the Cardiovascular System",9694140,R01AG054371,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' EKG ', ' ECG ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' skin conductance ', ' Skin Electric Conductance ', ' Psychogalvanic Reflex ', ' Electrodermal Response ', ' Galvanic Skin Response ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' mortality ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Gerontology ', ' biogerontology ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Ambulatory Monitoring ', ' Outpatient Monitoring ', ' Respondent ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Reaction ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' monitoring device ', ' stressor ', ' metropolitan ', ' Participant ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Devices ', ' age difference ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' Cardiac ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' heart rate variability ', ' stress reactivity ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' mortality disparity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2019,716164,0.19699063878168138
"Early Life Adversity, Cumulative Life Stress, Race, and Cellular Aging in Midlife Women and Offspring Early Life Adversity, Cumulative Stress, Race, & Cell Aging in Midlife Women & Offspring BACKGROUND: There is an increasingly recognized role of stress in elevating disease risk, especially among women, minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Few prospective studies follow individuals from childhood to adulthood, leaving critical unanswered questions such as which types of adversity, and life periods (childhood, adolescence, adulthood, or cumulative) have the greatest impact on biological aging and can help explain racial differences in health. We have a remarkable opportunity to examine types of lifespan stress in a longitudinal cohort of black and white women who have been followed from 10 years old. We have collected multiple sources of stress, including individual stressors (severe life events, chronic stressors, global perceived stress) and environmental stressors (neighborhood deprivation and violence). Our broad aim is to conduct a novel examination of adversity and links to current epigenomic markers (telomere length, epigenetic aging) in women and their children, and to systemic inflammation in the women. In this re- submission, we have identified archived serum samples from the womens’ childhood baseline visit and are thus able to examine change in inflammation as well. These indices of biological aging each serve as a reliable predictor of early disease. METHOD: We are conducting a 30 year follow up of the prospective NHLBI Growth and Health Study (NGHS), a biracial cohort of children to examine intergenerational transmission of obesity (R01 HD073568). Black and white girls were initially followed prospectively from 10 to 20 years old and are now being enrolled at roughly 39 years old. Here we propose to assess indices of cellular aging in 590 NGHS women and their most recent (index) child. Retention of sample and adherence to blood and saliva sampling are excellent and an R56 helped us ensure our target sample size. We will assess whether lifespan stress is associated with indices of accelerated cellular aging at age 39, and for inflammation, change from childhood (Aim 1) and secondarily whether types of stress (severe events, chronic stressors, global perceptions, neighborhood deprivation) or time-periods (childhood, adolescence, adulthood) have differential or cumulative effects. We will assess whether pregnancy stress or lifespan stress is associated with offspring epigenomic markers (Aim 2), and whether race modifies these effects (Aim 3). Lastly, we will explore whether high resilience (support and self- esteem) buffers the effects of adversity. SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATION: This will be the first prospective study to test lifespan stress predictors of three distinct indices of biological aging, each representing different pathways of aging, in a biracial cohort and to assess stress effects on offspring epigenome. This should advance our understanding of lifespan stress on aging biology. A more granular understanding of the types and timing of stress that impact aging processes is necessary for designing policies and programs that reduce socioeconomic disparities in health and aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Growing black/white disparities in health across generations has reached a critical juncture, and these differences may be due in part to greater stress exposures, which in turn may accelerate cellular aging processes. This study examines how different types of stress through the lifespan—such as traumatic events and chronic situations, perceptions of stress, and neighborhood deprivation-- might accelerate aging processes (as indexed by telomere length, epigenetic age, and inflammation) in a longitudinal cohort of biracial girls followed from age 10 and now 39, and whether their stress exposures also predict their offpsrings’ biological aging. A better understanding of the types of stress that impact health and intergenerational transmission of risk, as well as the potentially protective effects of psychological resiliency factors such as social support, will help inform the design of policies and programs that reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in premature aging and disease.","Early Life Adversity, Cumulative Life Stress,

"Psychosocial stress, epigenetics and health disparity in hypertension ABSTRACT Essential hypertension (EH) remains a significant health problem with striking racial disparity. Compared with European Americans (EAs), African Americans (AAs) not only have a greater prevalence of EH but also are specifically prone to the negative effects of EH. Growing evidence indicated that cumulative exposure to psychosocial stress plays an important role in the development of EH. Racial differences in these social determinants of EH are likely to contribute to the racial differences in EH. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms linking psychosocial stress to early etiology of EH. We hypothesize that exposure to chronic psychosocial stress adversely affect BP response to acute stress both in laboratory setting and real life via DNA methylation, impacting the progression of preclinical measurement of EH in early adulthood and culminating in EH. The fundamental objective of this proposal is to identify these DNA methylation changes and evaluate whether their roles differ between AAs and EAs. Building on our longitudinal Georgia Cardiovascular (CV) Twin Study in which a multi-ethnic twin sample of 750 twins (375 twin pairs) having at least one visit before age 18 and one visit from age 18-26 with blood samples available at this visit, we will conduct one additional follow-up visit (age range 30-42 years). The longitudinal twin study provides a powerful design to control both the genetic sources and plastic nature of DNA methylation. The specific aims are: (1) To examine the joint and distinctive impacts of psychosocial stress on DNA methylation changes in early adulthood. Genome wide DNA methylation and psychosocial stress exposure will be obtained at age 18- 26 and age 30-42. The CpG sites with their DNA methylation levels associated with stress exposure and showing changes with changes in exposure will be validated in our Georgia Stress and Heart cohort. Real-time PCR will also be conducted on genes within ±100kb of these CpG sites to check whether DNA methylation affects gene expression; (2) To identify the CpG sites with their DNA methylation levels mediating the effect of psychosocial factors on BP response to laboratory and real-life stress and preclinical measurements of EH (pulse wave velocity and left ventricular mass); and (3) To test whether the relationship identified in aim 1 and 2 are dependent on ethnicity and whether psychosocial stress related DNA methylation changes can potentially explain the health disparity between AAs and EAs in the development of EH.

"Addressing Intersecting Minority Stress: Development of an mHealth HIV Prevention Intervention for Young Black Men   PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) account for the highest proportion of new HIV  diagnoses in the United States. Although recent studies suggest that racial and sexual minority discrimination  may contribute to this trend, minority stress models do not frequently account for the intersectional effects of  these forms of discrimination among YBMSM. As a result, current HIV prevention interventions are not  equipped to intervene upon the stress process caused by intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination  that contributes to HIV risk. This Mentored Research Scientist Development Award (K01) will support the  candidate during his upcoming years of research and training focused on examining the role of intersecting  racial and sexual minority discrimination in HIV risk among YBMSM. The goal of the candidate’s research is to  test an intersectional minority stress model that incorporates HIV-­relevant biological, psychological, and  behavioral outcomes and indicators of stress among YBMSM. The results of this study will inform the  development of an mHealth intervention to promote effective coping to mitigate these minority stress pathways.  To accomplish these goals, the candidate requires training and mentorship in three areas: 1) assessing  biological indicators of stress;; 2) examining intersectional minority stress and HIV risk among YBMSM;; and 3)  designing and testing HIV-­focused mHealth interventions. Training through a combination of mentorship,  professional engagement, coursework, trainings, conferences, and mentored research projects will directly  support the candidate to effectively implement the specific research aims. The overarching aims of the  research projects are to: 1) Conduct a two-­week EMA study with 100 HIV-­negative YBMSM to assess the  intersection of racial and sexual minority discrimination on self-­reported emotion dysregulation and  psychological distress, biological indicators of stress, and behavioral HIV risk;; 2) Test an intersectional minority  stress model with the EMA data that examines two hypotheses: a) emotion dysregulation mediates  associations from intersecting discrimination to psychological distress and behavioral HIV risk;; b) coping  moderates the negative impact of intersecting discrimination on psychological distress, biological indicators of  stress, and behavioral HIV risk;; and 3) Utilize evidence from Aims 1 and 2 to design and pilot an mHealth  intervention to mitigate the negative impacts of intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination on HIV  risk and prevention among YBMSM. Together, these research projects will address essential questions about  the role of intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination in HIV risk among YBMSM, identify modifiable  targets for intervention, and examine preliminary feasibility, acceptability, and effect estimates of a novel  mHealth intervention to address these targets. The training and research plan will aid the candidate to develop  into an independent multidisciplinary investigator focused on creating innovative and high-­impact interventions  to reduce persistent HIV inequities for YBMSM.     Project Narrative. Given the overwhelming burden of HIV among young Black men who have sex with men (YBMSM) in the United States, there is a need for innovative, culturally-relevant, and accessible interventions to reduce their HIV risk. The present research is designed to test an intersectional minority stress model that examines the psychological, biological and behavioral effects of intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination on HIV risk among YBMSM. The goal of this research is to develop and pilot an mHealth intervention that promotes effective coping and reduces the negative impact of intersecting racial and sexual minority discrimination on HIV inequities among YBMSM.",Addressing Intersecting Minority Stress: Development of an mHealth HIV Prevention Intervention for Young Black Men,9988709,K01MH118091,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' AIDS ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Award ', ' Behavioral Sciences ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Measures ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' HIV/AIDS prevention ', ' HIV Prevention ', ' AIDS prevention ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Empirical Research ', ' Event ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' novel ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' AIDS/HIV problem ', ' HIV/AIDS problem ', ' HIV/AIDS ', ' AIDS/HIV ', ' HIV risk ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' HIV diagnosis ', ' HIV-2 test ', ' HIV-1 test ', ' HIV test ', ' AIDS/HIV test ', ' AIDS test ', ' Human immunodeficiency virus test ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Research Training ', ' transmission process ', ' Transmission ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 20 year old ', ' twenty years of age ', ' twenty year old ', ' age 20 years ', ' 20 years of age ', ' skill acquisition ', ' skill development ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' stem ', ' coping mechanism ', ' sexual minority ', ' Research Domain Criteria ', ' RDoC ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile health ', ' m-Health ', ' young men who have sex with men ', ' young MSM ', ' YMSM ', ' black men who have sex with men ', ' black MSM ', ' BMSM ', ' African-American men who have sex with men ', ' African American MSM ', ' AAMSM ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' emotion dysregulation ', ' emotional dysregulation ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' racial minority ', ' intersectionality ', ' pre-exposure prophylaxis ', ' PrEP ', ' ']",NIMH,RBHS-SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,K01,2019,184116,0.041862966700303005
"SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to experience negative health outcomes the longer they live in the U.S. For example, over time Hispanic immigrants engage in riskier behaviors such as substance abuse, violence, and risky sex, and experience more depressive symptoms. The stress associated with the acculturation process, acculturation stress, and resilience at the individual, family, community, and societal levels appear to play important roles in influencing risks. However, little is known about the causal mechanisms linking acculturation stress, resilience, and health outcomes among Hispanic immigrants. Further, little is known about what precise types of stressors (e.g., occupational stress vs. discrimination) and resilience factors (e.g., individual coping vs. family support) have the most important influence on health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants. The proposed longitudinal study (N = 385) will investigate the effects of acculturation stress and resilience on co-occurring substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV risk, and depression (i.e., syndemic conditions) and biological stress among young adult Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. More specifically, the proposed project aims to: 1) test theoretical links between the cumulative impact of acculturation stress and resilience on syndemic conditions and biological stress among recent young adult Hispanic immigrants over a two-year period, and 2) identify the specific types of acculturation stressors and resilience factors at the individual, family, community, and societal levels that are most important in predicting syndemic conditions and biological stress among this population over time. Young adult low-income Hispanic immigrant men and women within the first 10 years of immigration will be followed for two years. Biopsychosocial data will be collected from participants at baseline, and then 6 months (FU1), 12 months (FU2), 18 months (FU3), and 24 months later (FU4). Culturally specific measures of acculturation stress and resilience will be used to assess for individual, family, community, and societal risk and protective factors for syndemic conditions. Blood and urine samples will be obtained from participants to measure systemic inflammation (IL 6, IL8, and IL 18) and oxidative stress (F2 isoprostanes), previously validated biomarkers for psychological stress. Various descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistics, including latent growth curve modeling, will be used to address aims 1-2. The findings from this study have the potential to identify risk and protective factors for the decay in heath among Hispanic immigrants. A precise and culturally informed understanding of these phenomena is foundational for designing interventions that can ultimately promote the health and wellbeing of Hispanic immigrants, the largest immigrant group in the U.S. This study also has the potential to lay the theoretical foundation for biopsychosocial health disparities research in other populations. RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study seeks to describe the impact that acculturation stress and resilience plays in influencing behavioral, psychological, and biological health among young adult Hispanics who are recent immigrants. The findings from this study can inform interventions aiming to improve the health and well-being of Hispanic immigrants.","SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S.",9904803,R01MD012249,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Immigration ', ' Inflammation ', ' Influentials ', ' Language ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Perception ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' behavior influence ', ' behavioral influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' IL8 gene ', ' b-ENAP ', ' TSG-1 ', ' SCYB8 ', ' MONAP ', ' MDNCF ', ' LYNAP ', ' LUCT ', ' K60 ', ' IL8 ', ' IL-8 ', ' GCP1 ', ' CXCL8 ', ' AMCF-I ', ' 3-10C ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' family support ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,165841,0.10393957536364046
"Supplement to AG057235: Stress and the Genome: Testing the Impact of Social Effects on Gene Regulation Project Summary  The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and well being. Chronic social stress and reduced access to social support are strongly linked to major diseases of aging; as a result, social adversity is highly predictive of life expectancy itself. Recent evidence suggests that, while some of this relationship is explained by correlated factors such as smoking, obesity, and health care access, social stressors also have a direct impact on physiological function. Indeed, work in animal models has clearly demonstrated that the experience of social subordination alone can alter the function of the immune system, in part by altering gene regulation in immune cells.  The goal of the proposed research is to address a key outstanding question that arises from these findings: when, and for whom, are chronic social stress effects on immune function most important? To do so, it will take advantage of dominance rank in female rhesus macaques as a model for chronic social stressor exposure in humans. Rhesus macaque females are excellent models for human social stress because they naturally organize into dominance rank hierarchies in which low ranking individuals experience increased rates of harassment, reduced social affiliation, and physiological markers of rank-related stress. Importantly, dominance rank assignments, and thus an individual's exposure to social stressors, can be manipulated in this species by manipulating group membership. Such manipulations yield a powerful experimental model for investigating the consequences of socially induced stress—an approach that is directly translatable to humans, but that is practically and ethically impossible in humans themselves.  The proposed study will take advantage of this model to investigate how differential exposure to dominance rank-induced social stress causally influences gene expression in the immune system. Specifically, it will use an in vitro approach to efficiently screen for condition-specific social stress effects on gene expression levels across 30 physiologically relevant environmental conditions (e.g., pathogen exposure, steroid hormone signaling). It will complement the in vitro screen with an in vivo test of the gene regulatory and antibody response to influenza vaccination, a medical procedure in which variable responses are of particular concern as individuals age. Finally, it will test whether age, social behavior, and genotype can be used to predict interindividual variation in the strength of social stressor effects on immune regulation, and hence which individuals are most vulnerable. Together, the proposed analyses will provide much-needed insight into the factors that explain when and why individuals differ in their response to the same social stressors, as well as the potential consequences of these differences for medical treatment. The project's results will therefore have direct translational application to both identifying the most susceptible members of our aging population and suggesting tailored strategies for intervention. Project Narrative The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and wellbeing, with particularly strong predictive power for diseases of aging and mortality risk itself. This project uses a nonhuman primate model for human social stress, the rhesus macaque, to investigate the factors that explain interindividual variation in the impact of social stress on the genome, including the conditions under which these effects are most important. The results of this project will contribute to understanding how social stress influences disease susceptibility and how to identify those who are most vulnerable to its negative effects.",Supplement

"Improving Health Outcomes in African Americans with Type 2 Diabetes: A Culturally Tailored, Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management Education (RB-DSME) Intervention Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) costs the U.S. $327 billion annually, representing a 26% increase from 2012 to 2017. African Americans (AAs) are twice as likely to have T2DM as non-Hispanic Whites, have worse health outcomes, and are less likely to engage in self-management behaviors. Interventions addressing these disparities are urgently needed. Among AAs, T2DM-associated stress is often compounded by general life stress, which further constrains diabetes self-management and is associated with poor glucose control (A1C) and complications such as depression. The impact of stress on diabetes self-management and health outcomes may be attenuated by resilience: a resolve to succeed despite adversities. Even with evidence supporting resilience resources benefiting other health outcomes, there is a dearth of evidence-based T2DM resilience interventions. Building on our promising pilot work, the proposed study uses our culturally tailored, theory-derived Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management Education (RB-DSME) intervention to help participants manage the psychosocial and behavioral demands of the disease. We propose a 24-month, 2-arm, cluster RCT assigning churches to the RB-DSME or standard DSME condition. Both groups will receive a 10-month intervention: 8 weekly educational sessions, followed by 8 bimonthly support group sessions, followed by 2 booster sessions. To investigate the efficacy of RB-DSME, we will compare RB-DSME to DSME on T2DM physical (A1C, FBG, lipids, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure) and mental (depressive symptoms, diabetes distress, general stress) health outcomes. To inform more targeted future interventions, we will examine indirect effects of RB- DSME (vs DSME) on resilience resources (adaptation to stress, finding positive meaning, adaptive coping, coping with discrimination, spiritual coping, self-efficacy, social support, emotional regulation). We will also examine indirect effects of resilience resources on T2DM health outcomes through self-management behaviors (dietary intake, physical activity, glucose self-monitoring, medication adherence). Emerging evidence—including our work linking hair cortisol with A1C in AAs—suggests that improved HPA axis function, a biological marker of stress, is associated with favorable T2DM health outcomes. Thus, we will also examine indirect effects of resilience resources on T2DM health outcomes via HPA axis function (cortisol, DHEA). The Specific Aims are: 1) To compare T2DM physical (primary outcome: A1C) and mental (primary outcome: depressive symptoms) health outcomes in RB-DSME vs DSME at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-study entry; and 2) To test indirect effects of RB-DSME (vs DSME) on T2DM health outcomes via resilience resources, self-management behaviors, and HPA axis function. Our project will provide crucial guidance for addressing the T2DM burden among AAs by establishing the efficacy of our RB-DSME and identifying behavioral and biological mechanisms by which the program affects T2DM health outcomes. Our long-term goal is to enable AAs to effectively manage T2DM and thus avoid its serious consequences, via RB-DSME interventions in a range of community settings. African Americans are twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes as non-Hispanic Whites and are less likely to engage in effective diabetes self-management. There is a critical need for intensive lifestyle interventions that address the distress inherent in having the disease and the unique stressors faced by African Americans that may worsen diabetes-related health outcomes. Our program, Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management Education, integrates resilience resources with diabetes self-management skills to enable African-American patients to manage the daily demands of the disease and improve long-term adherence to healthy lifestyle choices, thereby reducing the negative health burden of diabetes.","Improving Health Outcomes in African Americans with Type 2 Diabetes: A Culturally Tailored, Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management Education (RB-DSME) Intervention",9864921,R01DK123146,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Control Groups ', ' dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Androstenolone ', ' DHEA ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone ', ' Prasterone ', ' Therapeutic Dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lipids ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Support Groups ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' African American ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' waist circumference ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' Church ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' behavior test ', ' behavioral test ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' arm ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' stress symptom ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2019,677516,0.04504413705179472
"Biomarkers of Health Risk Among African American Couples ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strong evidence has accrued indicating that inflammation (INF) predicts the onset of chronic, age-related diseases. Although psychosocial stress is a major determinant of INF, we know little about the role of stress contagion from romantic partners, a prominent social context in early adulthood, or the role of childhood stressors in amplifying INF response to adult stress. Evidence has accumulated indicating that early stress experiences may shift propensity to respond with INF due to early calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR). However, we have little information regarding the extent to which IRTR predicts amplified INF response to adult stressors or the extent which it accounts for the impact of early stressors on INF. In addition, we do not know the extent to which persistent, supportive relationships in young adulthood have the potential to ameliorate the impact of earlier stressors by modifying IRTR and so reducing INF in response to adult stressors. Finally, prior research has largely focused on White samples, thereby limiting our understanding of the causes of INF among African Americans, a group at elevated risk for age- related chronic illness. This application seeks funding to add assessment of romantic partners and to directly assess IRTR for both targets and partners who are participating in a recently funded application. In the parent application we assess INF and collect telephone interview data from targets regarding stress and health behaviors in a sample of roughly 700 African Americans (now 28 years of age). In the current application we add parallel interview assessments and assessment of INF for N = 320 romantic partners. In addition we add assessment of IRTR for both targets and romantic partners. This additional data collection will allow us to address the following specific aims: 1) Identify the effect of stress contagion on young adult INF among African Americans, controlling for own stressors and history of early exposure to stressors; 2) Test hypothesized amplification of effect on INF of own stress, stress contagion, and dyad-level effects due to exposure to early stressors, and examine the hypothesis that calibration of Inflammation Related Transcriptional Response (IRTR) is the mechanism by which early stress influences INF; and 3) Test the hypothesized role of persistent supportive romantic relationships (PSR) in ""recalibrating"" stress biology, i.e., examine the hypothesis that among those in persistent supportive relationships in young adulthood we will see reduced impact of early stress exposure on IRTR. The Institute of Medicine prescribes development of prevention based on longitudinal, epidemiological research with target populations. Currently, no prospective investigations identify the protective factors that interrup the impact of stress on INF for African Americans. The results of the proposed research will identify protective processes and serve as the basis for empirically- based, health disparities prevention programs as well as provide a basis for ongoing policy discussions, e.g. the Healthy Marriage Initiative. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Improving quality of longer lives requires information about sources of the inflammation linked to age- related, chronic diseases; causes that include social relationships and may lie at earlier stages of development. Building on prior research documenting the role of childhood stress in amplifying inflammatory responses to adult stress, the present study examines the interaction of child stress with stress contagion from adult romantic partners as well as ameliorative effects due to persistent, supportive romantic relationships, and so provides a foundation for development of preventative interventions to protect against amplified inflammation and a framework for ongoing policy discussions such as the healthy marriage initiative.",Biomarkers of Health Risk Among African American Couples,9666913,R01HD080749,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Biology ', ' Calibration ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Foundations ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Inflammation ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Interview ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' Marriage ', ' Parents ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' racial discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' Failure ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Policies ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' Dementia ', ' Amentia ', ' psychosocial ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' contagion ', ' Prevention program ', ' Prevention ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' healthy aging ', ' parent project ', ' public health relevance ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' emerging adult ', ' early adulthood ', ' predicting response ', ' response prediction ', ' predictor of response ', ' predictive response ', ' prediction of response ', ' protective factors ', ' early life adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' early adversity ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA,R01,2019,501397,0.20612964275731316
"Social Stressors and Inflammation: A Mixed Methods Approach to Preterm Birth African American women have 1.5 times the rates of preterm birth (PTB) (<37 weeks completed gestation) compared with non-Hispanic white women. This disproportionately high PTB rate in African Americans is a persistent health inequity that leads to high child mortality, morbidity, and developmental delays. In the U.S. approximately $26 billion are spent annually on health care costs for infants and children that were born prematurely. Recent attempts to explain the high PTB rates in African American women have focused on social stressors, such as disadvantaged neighborhoods, racial discrimination, and stressful life events. These social stressors may lead to PTB by increasing women’s emotional stress levels. Not surprisingly, emotional stress along with levels of the stress hormone cortisol and systemic inflammation - both physiological responses to stress - have all been related to higher risk of PTB. In contrast, one’s psychosocial resources (e.g., social support) can lessen emotional stress and have protective effects on PTB. Little is yet known about the pathways by which social stressors affect inflammation, and ultimately PTB. The objective of the proposed study is to determine how social stressors alter inflammation during pregnancy and lead to PTB in African American women. We aim to: 1) determine the pathways by which social stressors affect PTB; and 2) describe social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; the associations among these concepts; and their impact on PTB from women’s perspectives.  In this longitudinal convergent mixed methods design, we will enroll 1,500 African American women who live in the Detroit metropolitan area. We will collect data on social stressors, emotional stress, and psychosocial resources through questionnaires and administrative (e.g., census) data. This will be done three times prenatally. At these same time points, levels of cortisol and systemic inflammation will be determined from hair and blood samples, respectively. We will also obtain birth data from the prenatal and hospital records. In a subsample of 60 women, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to more specifically understand the associations among social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; and their impact on PTB. We will conduct a variety of statistical, qualitative and mixed methods analyses using both quantitative and qualitative data to determine answers to the aims of our study. We will also consider the timing of pregnancy in our analyses, as the prenatal data are collected at three distinct time points. The proposed research is highly relevant to NIH’s mission to elucidate mechanisms underlying health disparities in PTB. Insights gained from this mixed methods approach may lead to the development of an individualized PTB risk profile based on a woman's social stressors and biomarkers which will have potential use in clinical practice and be a target for culturally appropriate interventions to reduce PTB incidence in African American women, and will generate new perspectives for future research in other racial groups through our detailed focus on this high risk group. Preterm birth is a major risk for neonatal mortality and long-term child health problems, including motor and mental developmental delays and chronic illness. Knowledge of the social context of African American women’s lives will increase our understanding of why some women have poor pregnancy outcomes, generate new perspectives for future research, inform new lines of inquiry regarding the pathways through which stress affects preterm birth in other racial groups, contribute to the development of culturally appropriate interventions to reduce racial disparities in preterm birth, and ultimately improve birth outcomes.",Social Stressors and Inflammation: A Mixed Methods Approach to Preterm Birth,9607943,R01MD011575,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Mortality ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Hospital Records ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Socio-Cultural Stress Profiles, Stress Responses, and Health in Mexican American Adolescents This project is in response to PA-17-042 and examines the longitudinal influence of socio-cultural stressors, physiological and behavioral stress responses to these stressors, and health outcomes of adolescents in Mexican immigrant families. Recognizing the challenging social environments in which adolescents in Mexican immigrant families are embedded, this project creates socio-cultural stress profiles comprised of economic stress, discrimination and foreigner stress, and language brokering experiences (in which children translate between English and Spanish for their English-limited parents). Our ongoing research with adolescents in Mexican immigrant families has identified three socio-cultural stress profiles (moderate, protective, risk), three stable profiles over time (stable moderate, stable protective, stable risk), and two socio-cultural change profiles over time (improved, declined). The proposed project builds on a successful study of adolescents in Mexican immigrant families (PI: Kim, NSF, BCS-0956123 and BCS-651128; NIH, R03HD060045) to examine, prospectively, the influence of socio-cultural stress profiles in middle school alone, as well as continuity and change in socio-cultural stress profiles from middle school to high school, on adolescent health (Aim 1). Specifically, this grant will allow the research team to add measures of physiological health outcomes, namely inflammation (IL-6, C-reactive protein) and diabetes risk (hemoglobin A1c). We will also test a pathways model, to determine whether socio-cultural stress profiles are associated with adaptive or maladaptive physiological and behavioral stress responses that influence health (Aim 2). Further, we propose to test whether the associations from socio-cultural stress profiles to stress responses to health outcomes are exacerbated or mitigated through various moderators, including personal (resilience, parent support) and cultural (family obligation) resources, stress related to legal status, and language brokering places and content (Aim 3). Physiological stress response will be assessed via cortisol. Acute cortisol will be assessed by measuring reactivity and recovery to an adaptation of the Trier Social Stress Test, in which adolescents verbally translate a medical document for their parents. Day-to-day cortisol will also be measured. Substance use and sleep are self-reported daily, and motionlogger watches worn on the wrist provide an objective assessment of sleep. This study is very much in line with the 2016-2020 NIH strategic plan of studying normative populations to detect points for preventive interventions to reduce health disparities. It does so by studying socio-cultural stress profiles that include language brokering experiences, a common phenomenon in low-income Mexican immigrant families that has received little attention to date. We examine the complex conditions under which socio-cultural profiles can function as sources of both risk and protection for adolescents. This project has the potential to uncover processes and practices that can reduce persistent health disparities in Mexican immigrant families. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it focuses on the health outcomes of children of Mexican immigrants, a population with high rates of poverty, low levels of educational attainment, and a high risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It also focuses on the developmental period of adolescence, a vulnerable phase of life characterized by social and physical changes, during which behaviors that are predictive of adult health first become established. The results of this project should inform researchers and interventionists about how to support adolescents in Mexican immigrant families, by identifying how a confluence of socio-cultural stressors may function as adaptive or maladaptive, to mitigate the most damaging effects and enhance the payoffs of growing up in a Mexican immigrant family.","Socio-Cultural Stress Profiles, Stress Responses, and Health in Mexican American Adolescents",9669823,R21MD012706,"['Medical ', ' Adolescent ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Link ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Mexican ', ' Legal Status ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' junior high school ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Skin ', ' diabetes risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' virtual ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Trier Social Stress Test ', ' high risk ', ' adolescent health outcomes ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' adolescent health ', ' Adolescence ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Data Collection ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Language ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Mission ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Parents ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Plague ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Wrist ', ' Foreigner ', ' Measures ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2019,256234,0.08396639638563087
"SES-Related Disparities in Early Language Development and Child Risk for Developmental Language Disorder Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this study is to identify early risk for developmental language disorder (DLD) among young, low- income children, and to determine how caregiver and child chronic stress and interaction quality interact to disrupt language growth among these vulnerable children. The study is designed to address disparities in the rate of DLD among young children, with low-income children disproportionately affected (Norbury et al., 2017). The long-term objective is to identify pathways through which early family contexts and the conditions of poverty disrupt early language trajectories among low-income children and contribute to heightened rates of DLD. The proposed longitudinal study addresses three specific aims regarding low-income dyads: (1) to identify whether and to what extent caregiver stress affects their young children’s language trajectories and DLD status at 54 months; (2) to identify the extent to which children’s physiological stress contributes to their early language trajectories and DLD status at 54 months, and determine whether it is a key mediator of caregiver stress on these outcomes; and (3) to determine the interplay among caregiver stress, child stress, and caregiver-child interactions for their effects on children’s early language trajectories and DLD status at 54 months. Study procedures involve ascertainment of 320 low-income mothers and their 6- to 11-month-old children using medical records from a large urban hospital; eligible dyads will reside in households at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Measurements are collected thrice annually (one study visit, two in vivo observations) to comprehensively map family processes and experiences, caregiver-child interaction quality, caregiver stress and stress physiology, child stress physiology, and children’s linguistic trajectories until 54 months. The initial two study aims are addressed using multi-level growth models, with caregiver and child stress, respectively, as time-varying predictors. The third study aim uses multilevel path analyses to examine the interplay among child and caregiver stress, caregiver-child interactions, and children’s language trajectories and DLD status at 54 months. Project Narrative Developmental language disorder (DLD) is the most common developmental disability affecting young children, and has serious consequences for young children's overall development and educational achievement and for later socioeconomic and health disparities. The goal of this study is to identify early risk for developmental language disorder among young, low-income children, and to determine how caregiver and child chronic stress and interaction quality interact to affect language development among these vulnerable children.",SES-Related Disparities in Early Language Development and Child Risk for Developmental Language Disorder,9801240,R01DC018009,"['Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mothers ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' parent child interaction ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Care Givers ', ' Caregivers ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Population Research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population-based research ', ' in vivo ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Family Process ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Biosocial ', ' Impairment ', ' federal poverty level ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' perceived stress ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Child Language ', ' Economics ', ' training status ', ' training level ', ' training achievement ', ' educational level ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' Educational Status ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' ']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,658178,0.0870004377158048
"Effects of Social Networks and Policy Context on Health among Older Sexual and Gender Minorities in the US South ABSTRACT Older sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations experience significant disparities in morbidity and disability compared with their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. There are two primary explanations as to why physical health, mental health, and disability outcomes may differ for older SGM adults compared to older heterosexual and cisgender adults: 1) experiences of minority stress that negatively affect health over the life course, and 2) differences in the kind and quality of social networks and support in older age. In this study we develop and test a new conceptual model that integrates these two disparate areas of research by applying a multilevel approach to understanding how minority stress processes work. We contend that social networks mediate the relationship between minority stress and health. Social network effects may be negative, exacerbating the effects of negative life experiences of discrimination or violence by reinforcing feelings of negative marginality relative to dominant societal values and structures. Alternatively, social networks may buffer the effects of negative life experiences among SGM adults whose networks include more positive valuations of SGM identities. To test this model, we will collect in-depth ego-centric network data over three waves from 800 SGM adults aged 50 to 70 years and residing in the metropolitan statistical areas of three midsize cities in the US South: Nashville, TN; Birmingham, AL; and Raleigh, NC. Participants will be recruited using multiple face-to-face, community and targeted online methods in order to ensure inclusion of more isolated individuals or individuals who are less involved with community organizations. Surveys will be administered using a web-based instrument developed specifically for assessing multidimensional aspects of personal networks, physical and mental health, and experiences of minority stress. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project is important for public health because sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations experience substantial disparities in morbidity, mental health, and physical disability as they age. In this longitudinal panel study of minority stress, social networks, and health among older SGM adults in the United States, it will be possible to see how a person's social networks--and the attendant support they provide--shape individuals' responses to negative life experiences, including discrimination, harassment, and violence, and the effects of these life experiences on physical and mental health, morbidity, and disability. Understanding how networks and social support may mediate the effects of negative life events on health will have important policy and prevention implications for reducing health disparities by sexual orientation and gender identity, especially as the SGM population in the United States ages.",Effects of Social Networks and Policy Context on Health among Older Sexual and Gender Minorities in the US South,9797419,R01AG063771,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Buffers ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Ego ', ' Family ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Life Experience ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Literature ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Policies ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' violent behavior ', ' violent ', ' Violence ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' community organizations ', ' public health relevance ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' LGBT ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' support network ', ' cisgender ', ' cis-gender ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' data access ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' recruit ', ' Service provision ', ' protective factors ', ' individual response ', ' individualized response ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,383934,0.014480420649059399
"Impact of social factors on breast cancer biology in African-American women ABSTRACT African American (AA) women are more likely to be diagnosed at an early age with breast cancer (BC), have aggressive disease and experience greater mortality, compared to their Caucasian American (CA) counterparts. Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress have long been believed to be the prime cause of such health disparities; however, it is not yet well understood how these social factors are translated into increased cancer risk, aggressive tumor-subtypes, and poor clinical outcomes. Demographic data suggest that AA women encounter more socioeconomic difficulties than CA women and social stressors impact human biology through epigenomic modifications of gene functions. MicroRNAs, which are important epigenetic modulators of gene expression and key players in human biology and disease, are known to be regulated by stress hormones/cytokines and exhibit differential expression in socially disadvantaged population. Along these lines, our published and preliminary studies have identified increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones (resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol), and certain microRNAs (miR-511, miR-27a, and miR-33a) in AA women (with or without BC). We have also observed that treatment of BC cells and macrophages with resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol leads to an upregulation of miR-511, miR-27a, and miR-33a, promotes growth and malignant behavior of BC cells, and induces M2 polarization of macrophages. These compelling findings build a strong scientific premise for this project and support our hypothesis that socioeconomic hardships promote chronic inflammation and stress leading to altered serum levels of hormones and cytokines (such as resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol), which in turn, modulate the expression of immune-suppressive and tumor- promoting miRNAs, eventually contributing to BC pathogenesis. In four specific aims, we propose to determine global changes in circulating microRNAs in serum of AA and CA women (with or without BC) and establish their correlation with SES (low/moderate/high) (Aim 1); analyze levels of resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol in serum, and study their association with SES and serum miRNAs (Aim 2); examine regulation of miRNAs by resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol and delineate the underlying mechanisms (Aim 3); and establish the pathobiological significance of differentially-expressed miRNAs (Aim 4). Together, these studies will establish the functional association between socioeconomic health determinants and breast tumor biology, and support the role of miRNAs as epigenomic modifiers that link the social stress to biological phenotypes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic factors are suggested to affect gene function and thereby influence health trajectories or modify disease risk in the racial/ethnic minority and health disparity populations. The proposed research will characterize global changes in serum microRNAs (epigenomic regulators of gene expression) of African American women, establish their correlative association with socioeconomic status and physiological stress caused by social hardships, and generate experimental support for these associations at the mechanistic and functional levels. Resulting data is expected to support the role of miRNAs as epigenomic modifiers linking social stress to biological phenotypes, which, in the longer-term, will help in planning effective strategies to reduce existing disparity gaps in the health outcomes.",Impact of social factors on breast cancer biology in African-American women,9824210,R01CA231925,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alabama ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' trans acting element ', ' regulatory gene ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Hormones ', ' Household ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' macrophage ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Poverty ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Shoulder ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Upregulation ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' cytokine ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant -

"Investigating the Neurodevelopmental Effects of Pyrethroid Pesticide and Stress Exposure On the Dopamine System in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 7% of children, making it one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders worldwide. ADHD presents a significant public health burden because the disorder causes hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention symptoms that affect individuals in social, academic, and occupational settings, and can affect individuals well into adulthood. To date, no singular pathogenic cause of ADHD has been found and ADHD etiology is most likely multifactorial. While most patients with ADHD are treated with the stimulant methylphenidate, long-term use is associated with cognitive side effects and substance abuse, and significantly decreased quality of life still occurs. Elucidating the etiology and pathogenesis of ADHD is therefore imperative. Our group recently showed that exposure to pyrethroid pesticides induces alterations in dopaminergic proteins and ADHD-like behaviors in a mouse model. Interestingly, pyrethroid pesticide exposure is higher in low socioeconomic status populations, and these populations are also at increased risk of ADHD. Low socioeconomic status populations also experience greater amounts of chronic psychosocial stress, which alters the dopaminergic system in a rodent model. Thus, certain populations of children may be exposed to both pyrethroid pesticides and chronic psychosocial stress, two environmental exposures that are known to change components of the dopamine system. We thus hypothesize that the combined dopaminergic effects of pyrethroid pesticide and stress exposure will lead to additive effects on the dopamine system, ultimately increasing the risk of developing ADHD. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims. Aim 1 is to determine the neurobehavioral and neuropathologic effects of combined neurodevelopmental pyrethroid and corticosterone exposure in mice. More specifically, we will assess behavioral and neurochemical changes that occur in the dopamine system in response to pyrethroid pesticide and stress hormone exposure alone and in combination from gestation through adulthood. To do so, we will utilize a neurodevelopmental mouse model that we previously validated for examination of dopamine-related changes after pyrethroid pesticide exposure. Aim 2 is to determine whether key dopaminergic regions exhibit altered levels of DNA methylation in response to combined neurodevelopmental pyrethroid and corticosterone exposure in mice. To study these epigenetic effects, we will utilize the neurodevelopmental mouse model described in Aim 1, isolate midbrain tissue, and use targeted next-generation sequencing to assess whether DNA methylation changes at key dopaminergic gene regions. Altogether, this research will yield important mechanistic insight into the consequences of pyrethroid and stress hormone exposures in the dopaminergic system, in the context of neurodevelopment and ADHD. Understanding mechanisms of ADHD etiology and pathogenesis will provide valuable information for development of more effective ADHD pharmacotherapies and behavioral interventions, as well as the implementation of diagnostic screening targeted towards at-risk populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder impacts the academic, social, and occupational function of 7% of children around the world. Environmental exposures have been linked to risk of developing this disease but have mostly been studied in isolation. Here, we will investigate the effects of two environmental exposures together to better understand why certain populations are at increased risk for developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity

"Culturally Responsive Stress Reduction: A Mobile Mindfulness Application toSupport Health Promotion for African Americans ABSTRACT  The proposed intervention, Culturally Responsible Stress Reduction: A Mobile Mindfulness Application to Support Health Promotion for African Americans (CRSR), is designed to encourage the use of mindfulness to mitigate the disproportionate amount of stress-related health disparities facing African Americans. Current mindfulness approaches have been unsuccessful in engaging this population. This proposal aims to bridge this disparity by developing an mHealth (mobile health) mindfulness application (“app”) tailored specifically to the cultural values of the African American community.  Mindfulness involves meditative practices that cultivate purposeful and nonjudgmental attention to current thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations in the body. Mindfulness has been incorporated into widely-used interventions, including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The CRSR app will be grounded in ACT and will integrate the convenience of mobile technology with tailored content to allow users to shift from potentially harmful culturally prescribed stress-coping activities (e.g., self-reliance, emotional suppression) to adaptive mindfulness-based stress-coping activities aligned with culturally specific values. This integration of content, backed by theory and empirical evidence, effective instructional delivery, an interdisciplinary development team, and modern communication technology will produce an effective mHealth intervention.  The CRSR app features include guided meditations to connect the user to the present moment and a place of calm through culturally aligned exercises grounded in spirituality, orality, self-empowerment, and resilience; personalized notifications prompting users to reflect and engage with the app; periodic email messages on the importance mindfulness as a way increase control over physical and psychological health; and user- customized reminders.  Phase I included developing a testable prototype of the CRSR app, called Mindful You. The prototype provided functionality for participants to practice mindfulness and was used to test proof of concept, i.e., the feasibility and social acceptability of the CRSR app. Users experienced significantly decreased stress and increased self-efficacy. They also reported increased use of mindfulness behaviors and improved self- regulation. Phase II will iteratively build on the prototype to develop the final product and test its efficacy with a fully-powered randomized controlled trial. The final product will consist of a native mobile application on Android and Apple iOS.  The applicant, Trifoia, has assembled a knowledgeable and experienced team of research scientists, content and technology developers, and evaluation specialists to adequately realize this project. The company has an established track record of developing and marketing technology-assisted public health interventions. NARRATIVE  The proposed project will finalize and test a mHealth (mobile health) mindfulness application, Mindful You, tailored specifically to the cultural values of the African American community. Current mindfulness approaches to stress management have been unsuccessful in engaging this population. Mindful You actively leads users through mindfulness exercises to diffuse tension and decrease stress, aiming to reduce the disproportionate burden of stress-related health disparities among African

"Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations Project Summary/Abstract of the PRIME parent award: Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures Environmental exposures often cumulate in particular geographies, and the nature of the complex mixtures that characterize these exposures remains understudied. In addition, adverse environmental exposures often occur in communities facing multiple social stressors such as deteriorating housing, inadequate access to health care, poor schools, high unemployment, crime, and poverty – all of which may compound the effects of environmental exposures. Our central objective is to develop new data architecture, statistical, and machine learning methods to assess how exposure to environmental mixtures shapes educational outcomes in the presence or absence of social stress. We focus on air pollution mixtures, childhood lead exposure, and social stressors. We will implement our proposed work in North Carolina (NC), a state characterized by diverse environmental features, industrial activities, and airsheds typified by varying pollution emission sources and resulting pollutant mixtures. To accomplish this central objective, we will first develop, document, and disseminate methods for building space-time environmental and social data architectures. We will implement this for all of NC, incorporating data on air pollution, lead exposure risk, and social exposures from 1990-2015+ (dataset 1). Second, we will refine methods for linking unrelated datasets to build a space-time child movement and outcome data architecture (dataset 2). Third, we will connect exposures (dataset 1) and outcomes (dataset 2) data via shared geography and temporality into a single, comprehensive geodatabase. Fourth, we will implement increasingly complex methods to assess the effect of environmental mixtures in the presence or absence of social stressors on early childhood educational outcomes. We will document and disseminate all of the underlying methodological work via public website. The proposed work leverages a rich array of data resources already available to the investigators (with some significantly post-processed) and allows tracking of children across space and time. Our team brings tools from modern data science (hierarchical Bayesian methods with variable selection, spatial point process models, machine learning) to bear on the critical question of how environmental mixtures shape child outcomes directly and differentially in the presence of social stress. Project Narrative Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) are major causes of perinatal mortality and morbidity and have profound consequences for maternal and child health, but it is unclear if and how rates of HDP are changing over time, or whether neighborhood conditions (e.g., racial residential segregation) and air pollution exposure are associated with risk of developing HDP. We use detailed birth records and Bayesian spatial analysis methods to better understand how HDP rates have changed over a 20 year period (1995-2014), whether racial/ethnic disparities in HDP rates have narrowed or widened in this time frame, and if neighborhood racial segregation and air pollution exposure are associated with an individual’s HDP risk.",Bringing Modern Data Science Tools to Bear on Environmental Mixtures: Administrative Supplement for U3 Populations,9911827,R01ES028819,"['Maternal and Child Health ', ' Process ', ' web site ', ' website ', ' lead exposure ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' learning strategy ', ' learning method ', ' learning activity ', ' Data Science ', ' perinatal morbidity ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' data resource ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Award ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Birth Records ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Geography ', ' Housing ', ' Industrialization ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Modernization ', ' body movement ', ' Movement ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' North Carolina ', ' Parents ', ' perinatal deaths ', ' Perinatal lethality ', ' Perinatal Mortalities ', ' Perinatal mortality demographics ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy Rate ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Work ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' pregnancy disorder ', ' Link ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Individual ', ' Bayesian Analysis ', ' Bayesian statistics ', ' Bayesian statistical inference ', ' Bayesian statistical analysis ', ' Bayesian spatial analysis ', ' Bayesian network analysis ', ' Bayesian inference ', ' Bayesian computation ', ' Bayesian Method ', ' Bayesian posterior distribution ', ' Bayesian classification procedure ', ' Bayesian classification method ', ' Bayesian approaches ', ' Bayesian Statistical Method ', ' Bayesian Methodology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' tool ', ' Nature ', ' Machine Learning ', ' support vector machine ', ' statistical learning ', ' kernel methods ', ' Pollution ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' stressor ', ' early childhood ', ' pollutant ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' social stress ', ' Complex Mixtures ', ' Administrative Supplement ', ' Data ', ' ']",NIEHS,RICE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,117375,0.015305542487813763
"Acculturation, Stress, and Adolescent Health. Project Summary/Abstract  Population surveillance data indicate disparities in many outcomes for Hispanic youth. The past several decades have witnessed a burgeoning interest in the role of cultural factors in Hispanic youth development, with a focus on the cultural challenges these youth face. Indeed, in the US, Hispanic youth – 70% if whom are from immigrant families – are faced with the challenge of acculturation – the process by which youth retain their cultural heritage and/or adopt the new receiving culture. This process may not only be stressful in itself, but may also be exacerbated by the long-standing political rhetoric characterizing Hispanic immigrants as criminals and as a drain on the country. Increasingly anti-Hispanic and xenophobic attitudes in the United States have created an increasingly hostile environment for Hispanic immigrants. This hostility helps to create culturally stressful experiences. A growing literature has examined whether such cultural stress influences various developmental outcomes, using a range of instruments to measure various facets of cultural stress. However, no existing scale is comprehensive enough to assess the nuances of cultural stressors faced by Hispanic youth.  The scientific premise of the proposed study is to provide a more comprehensive and rigorous measure of cultural stress. Towards this end, we will pursue the following specific aims: 1) Conduct qualitative focus groups with Hispanic youth from two major metropolitan areas of the US (Miami and Los Angeles) and use content analysis to lay the foundation for a new culturally grounded and psychometrically refined cultural stress assessment; 2) Assess the reliability of the new multidimensional instrument using Exploratory Factor (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) techniques and assess measurement invariance across age, gender, site, and immigration status using multi-group CFA techniques; 3) Evaluate the extent to which cultural stress is uniquely different from other forms of stress (i.e., normative, economic, neighborhood, and family stress) and test the predictive validity of cultural stress with youth outcomes (delinquency, aggression, depressive symptoms, drug and alcohol use, and well-being); and 4) establish diagnostic cut-off values for the cultural stress measure.  Our approach is innovative for several reasons. First, we use samples drawn from two distinct immigration gateway communities, ensuring we capture heterogeneity in terms both of acculturative experiences and nationality, immigration status, and demographic composition. Second, we use focus-groups to “unpack” cultural stress to provide a more dynamic perspective of Hispanic youths' lives, with greater detail on what they consider “stressful” given their own struggles and challenges. Third, we establish divergent and convergent validity vis-à-vis normative, economic, neighborhood, and family stress to test whether the developed instrument is empirically distinct from other stressors. Our proposed research is significant because it lays the groundwork for a comprehensive operationalization of cultural stress that is empirically distinct from other sources of stress. This is a necessary first step toward understanding the impact of cultural stress on Hispanic youth and toward identifying intervention mechanisms and targets. Project Narrative: Public Health Relevance The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will provide comprehensive, and contextually and developmentally appropriate, measure of cultural stress that is empirically distinct from other stressors. Such a measure will open up the possibility of accurately understanding the impact of cultural stress on substance use and youth outcomes. Such research will serve as an important foundational step prior to the development of evidence-based programs designed to support Hispanic youth in navigating the challenge of acculturation (the process by which youth retain their cultural heritage and/or adopt the new receiving culture). The proposed project is highly relevant to NICHD's mission because it constitutes a critical step toward ensuring that Hispanic youth can achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.","Acculturation, Stress, and Adolescent Health.",9677174,R21HD095636,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Attitude ', ' California ', ' Communities ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Family ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Florida ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hostility ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mission ', ' Nationalities ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Receiver Operator Characteristics ', ' Receiver Operating Characteristics ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Schools ', ' Sensitivity and Specificity ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' problematic alcohol use ', ' problematic alcohol consumption ', ' problem drinking ', ' problem alcohol use ', ' hazardous alcohol use ', ' ethanol abuse ', ' alcohol problem ', ' alcohol co-abuse ', ' EtOH abuse ', ' Alcohol abuse ', ' Factor Analyses ', ' Factor Analysis ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Ensure ', ' Failure ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' using substances ', ' substance using ', ' substance use ', ' AOD use ', ' Mexican ', ' Measurement ', ' Drug usage ', ' drug use ', ' Problem behavior ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Immigrant ', ' instrument ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Nature ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' metropolitan ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention program ', ' cultural values ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' instrument development ', ' device development ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Subgroup ', ' Sum ', ' Validation ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Life Stress ', ' Stress Tests ', ' National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism ', ' NIAAA ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based program ', ' public health relevance ', ' longitudinal design ', ' surveillance data ', ' screening ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' school district ', ' adolescent health ', ' Cuban ', ' predictive test ', ' predictive assay ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R21,2019,279179,0.12673430158449295
"Biopsychosocial Mechanisms Linking Gender Minority Stress to HIV Comorbidities Project Summary/Abstract Despite a high prevalence of HIV among gender minority women, very little is known about HIV comorbid conditions in this population. Understanding the mechanisms of underlying HIV-related comorbidities in this health disparity population is an important step toward advancing health equity. The address this gap in knowledge, the study seeks to elucidate pathways linking stigma and physiologic stress to HIV comorbidities among Black and Latina gender minority women. The specific aims of the project include to: (1) quantify the longitudinal relationship of stigma to chronic stress biomarkers; (2) identify pathways linking chronic stress biomarkers to HIV comorbidities; and (3) examine the role of chronic stress in pathways linking stigma, sex hormones, and HIV comorbidities. These aims will be met using existing NIH-funded cohort platforms to enroll and follow 200 participants in a 24-month, mixed-methods, prospective study to measure stigma, biomarkers of chronic stress, sex hormones, mental health, and CVD risk. Data will be collected at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-months. This longitudinal study blends in-depth-interviews and quantitative psychosocial research with clinical and biological measures to advance understanding of the complex relationships between social experiences and physical health. This innovative research will identify mechanisms underlying associations between stigma and HIV comorbidities. It has important implications for interventions with health disparity populations living with HIV and will provide novel information that can be used to guide clinical practice and reduce health disparities. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance A disproportionate number of gender minority women are living with HIV in the United States, yet information about mechanisms of disparities for their HIV-related comorbidities is quite limited. This research takes a step toward filling this gap by building on the existing infrastructure of current NIH-funded prospective cohorts.

"Projection-specific gene expression in resilience to chronic stress Project Summary Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects ~4% of the worldwide population, and these numbers are continuously increasing. Moreover, MDD disproportionately affects women, who are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with the disease. Thus, uncovering the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms underlying susceptibility and resilience to depression is critical. Recent work demonstrates that ventral hippocampal (vHPC) projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulate mood and susceptibility to stress. Our group has shown that the transcription factor ΔFosB is crucial for hippocampal cell morphology and learning, and several lines of evidence implicate hippocampal ΔFosB in depressive-like behaviors (e.g., FosB knockout mice have hippocampal malformations and depressive behaviors, and current antidepressants induce ΔFosB in vHPC). However, to date there is no study characterizing the role of hippocampal ΔFosB in stress resilience and depression. To this end, we have produced a novel dual-virus CRISPR-Cas9 system allowing knockout of FosB gene expression specifically in vHPC cells projecting to the NAc. In combination with our many well-vetted molecular, physiological, and behavioral tools and models, this will allow us to address the central hypothesis that ΔFosB expression in vHPC neurons projecting to NAc mediates cell function and resilience to social stress in male and female mice. To test this hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims. In Aim I, we will first characterize the epigenetic mechanisms of induction of the FosB gene in hippocampus by chronic stress, determine its role in resilience to stress in both males and females, and uncover its transcriptional targets in vHPC. Indeed, our preliminary data show that inhibition of ΔFosB in vHPC induces susceptibility to depression-like symptoms. In Aim II, we will examine the stress induction and cellular effects of ΔFosB in vHPC neurons with projections to various brain regions, including NAc, then use our novel dual-virus system to knock down FosB gene expression specifically in vHPC cells projecting to the NAc and observe the behavioral results on stress responses. Here, too, we have strong preliminary data suggesting that ΔFosB regulates the excitability of vHPC neurons, and that ΔFosB expression in the vHPC- NAc projection cells regulates susceptibility to depression. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the critical role of ΔFosB in stress-induced changes in hippocampal control of limbic circuitry of both males and females, as well as identify novel ΔFosB targets that could serve as potential points for sex-specific therapeutic intervention in depression or PTSD. Stressful and traumatic experiences can contribute to mood disorders in some individuals while others are resilient to this process, and though we know that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in stress responses, there is a critical gap in our knowledge of how changes in hippocampal gene expression may drive resilience to stress. The proposed work seeks to delineate the role of ΔFosB, a transcription factor induced by stress, in the changes in gene transcription and cell physiology of hippocampal neurons that project to specific brain targets to mediate resilience to stress. This work is relevant to NIMH’s high priority interest in research utilizing sex as a biological variable and investigating mental health disparities, and utilizes innovative techniques to uncover basic pathophysiology that may be exploited as novel therapeutic interventions in major depressive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder.",Projection-specific gene expression in resilience to

"Intergenerational Transmission of Stress: Psychosocial and Biological Mechanisms PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite growing evidence that health outcomes are perpetuated across generations, empirical examinations of putative mechanisms underlying this intergenerational transmission are lacking. Explanatory mechanisms often focus on stress, which manifests in both psychological and physical symptoms. Relevant pathways have primarily been tested within a single generation or in non-human animal research. From mouse to man, evidence suggests that interplay across stress-related biological (e.g., cortisol, inflammation, telomeres) and psychosocial (e.g., social integration, health behaviors) factors critically contribute to the intergenerational transmission of health. The proposed study will examine the psychosocial ad biological mechanisms through which adversity transmits adverse mental and physical health outcomes across 3 generations and promotes the maintenance of health disparities. To this end, we will leverage a large (G1, n=1,630) and diverse (33% African-American) sample of older adults (currently aged 64-73) enrolled in an ongoing NIH-funded longitudinal study of stress and health and recruit their children (G2, n=2,200) and grandchildren (G3, n=1,900) to complete self-report questionnaires assessing stress, psychosocial factors, and health. From these, a subsample of 300 (150 Black and 150 White) G1/G2/G3 triads (total N=900) will visit our lab to provide blood and saliva measures so that we may assay the stress hormone cortisol, as well as inflammation markers. We will assay both their basal function and evoked activity. Triads and dyads will return to the lab 2.5 years later for a repeat assessment. All measures will be integrated with existing G1 data from our ongoing longitudinal samples. Investigating the intergenerational transmission of stress-related psychosocial and biological factors promises to inform our understanding of how health outcomes and racial health disparities are perpetuated across generations and, may, ultimately guide targeted prevention and public policy. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Health outcomes and disparities are frequently perpetuated across generations, but little is known about mechanisms that might contribute to this challenging problem. The current project examines how adversity (e.g., socioeconomic status, childhood maltreatment, stressful life events, discrimination), psychosocial (e.g., health behaviors, social integration) and biological (e.g., stress hormones, inflammatory signaling) factors contribute to physical and mental health across three generations in a large (>5,500), racially diverse (33% Black) sample. Understanding the role of adversity, as well as psychosocial and biological factors in the intergenerational transmission of health will aid efforts to disrupt the continuation of health problems and

"Epigenetic Mediation of Adverse Social Context on Stress Response, Socioemotional Development, and Health in a Population-based Study of Minority and Low SES Children and Adolescents Project Abstract Pronounced disparities exist by race, ethnicity, and SES in children and adolescents across a range of health conditions, and many adult health disparities can be traced to childhood social contextual inequalities. Epigenetics—modifications to the genome that are not changes in nucleotide sequence—holds great promise as potential indicators of contextual effects and health condition, potentially uncovering health disparities long before they are normally observable. Building on an existing representative study of children, this proposal will directly respond to PAR-16-355 by: 1) assembling epigenome-wide data on 2,000 children at two points in time, 2) describing methylation patterns in 3 race/ethnic groups and across SES levels, and 3) explicating epigenetic associations with social adversity, biological processes, and socioemotional development. The overarching hypothesis is that DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, DHEA levels) and stress responsive behaviors (behavioral problems, risk taking, and resilience). We further hypothesize both differential exposure and differential response to adversity by race/ethnicity and SES explains some of the disparity in stress response and socioemotional development—thereby requiring formal comparisons of race/ethnicity and SES in the same study. To conduct this research we utilize the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS): a 20-city nationally and city representative sample of 4898 children born in 1998- 2000. FFCW provides a uniquely high prevalence of non-Hispanic Black (47%), Hispanic (27%), and impoverished families, making the data particularly useful for studying race/ethnic and SES differences. Families were interviewed at birth and at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15—with biological data collected at ages 9 and 15. The expected results will be to provide estimates of: 1) population-based epigenome-wide DNA methylation measures for 3 race/ethnic groups (Hispanic n=600, African ancestry n=980, European ancestry n=420) in childhood and adolescence, 2) associations of social adversity across development (from in utero to age 15) with DNA methylation, 3) associations between DNA methylation and biological measures of stress response (i.e. telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, and DHEA levels), 4) associations between development of stress response behaviors and methylation profiles, and 5) comparisons of all these relationships in 3 race/ethnic groups and across a wide range of SES.  Project Narrative This proposal examines if DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and

"Testing cortisol dysregulation as a mediator between early stress and adolescent cardiovascular health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Psychosocial stress in early childhood has been linked to poorer cardiovascular health, with behavioral and biological alterations as potential mechanisms. One proposed mechanism between early stress and poorer cardiovascular health later in life is dysregulation in cortisol, a hormone that mediates stress responses and regulates metabolism. Cortisol dysregulation can include heightened or blunted cortisol levels, as both have been associated with chronic stress and poor health. A second proposed mechanism is alterations in diet and eating behaviors following early psychosocial stress as acute and chronic stress have been associated with obesogenic diet and eating behaviors. It is currently unknown whether cortisol dysregulation and altered diet and eating behaviors mediate the association between early psychosocial stress and poorer cardiovascular health in adolescence. The goal of this project is to understand whether cortisol dysregulation and altered diet and eating behaviors are pathways between early childhood stress and poorer cardiovascular health in adolescence. This work will identify targets for interventions to promote ideal cardiovascular health in populations who have experienced early stress. This goal will be accomplished using two complementary cohorts: new data collected on 100 diverse adolescents oversampled for high psychosocial risk and existing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; N=9,600). These cohorts will be used to address two aims. Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that cortisol dysregulation mediates the association between psychosocial stress in early childhood and 1a) adolescent obesity, blood pressure, and serum markers of inflammation and poor cardiovascular health, and 1b) adolescent obesogenic dietary patterns and eating behaviors. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that childhood obesogenic dietary patterns and eating behaviors mediates the association between psychosocial stress in early childhood and 2a) adolescent obesity, blood pressure, and serum markers of inflammation and poor cardiovascular health, and 2b) adolescent obesogenic dietary patterns and eating behaviors. I am a developmental psychologist with expertise in childhood psychosocial stress and cortisol regulation. This award will enable me to extend my expertise to assessing and improving cardiovascular health in adolescents. To conduct this research, I will complete a training plan based at the University of Denver under the primary mentorship of Dr. Elysia Davis. I will obtain training and content knowledge in the following areas: 1) cardiovascular health and gold-standard approaches for measurement of obesity, blood pressure, and serum markers of cardiovascular health; 2) diet and eating behavior assessment; 3) advanced statistics; and 4) conducting interventions. The research and training in this proposal will help me launch an independent career investigating pathways from early stress to cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mounting evidence indicates individuals who experienced chronic psychosocial stress in childhood are less likely to have ideal cardiovascular health in adolescence and adulthood. The proposed research investigates whether cortisol dysregulation and obesogenic diet and eating behaviors following childhood stress are pathways to poorer cardiovascular health in adolescence. A better understanding of pathways from early stress to poorer cardiovascular health has the potential to inform interventions for those who experienced chronic stress in childhood.",Testing cortisol

"Health disparities, stress pathways, and stress-related comorbidities among MSM living with HIV Project Summary Stress is associated with HIV risk behaviors, immune dysregulation, and among people living with HIV (PLWH) it has been associated with viral load and disease progression. The goal of this study is to better understand the mechanisms of stress and stress-related comorbidities and how they exacerbate HIV-related health disparities among HIV-infected Black men who have sex with men (BMSM). Studies in many parts of the US suggest that BMSM often live or spend much of their time in impoverished neighborhoods where physical and social disorders (e.g., physical decay, violence, discrimination) are clustered. These socio-structural factors can be conceptualized as chronic and acute stressors and may promote other stressors that lead to HIV-related outcomes. While much of the literature on minority stress has focused on major discriminatory events, this proposed study will examine microaggressions. We will comprehensively assess chronic, acute, and daily psychosocial stressors that are particularly relevant to MSM, especially BMSM. Moreover, we will use measures of hypothalamic–pituitary– adrenal (HPA) axis responses, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and inflammatory biomarkers to identify specific stress pathways among HIV-infected BMSM and White MSM (WMSM) that can be targeted in future interventions. We aim to provide an extension of minority stress theory by utilizing intensive longitudinal protocols to assess daily discriminatory events and other stressors, and to explore the association with HIV-related behaviors and physiological outcomes. Built upon the evidence of feasibility and acceptability from our previous research, this aim will be accomplished by using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of stressors and stress, Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), and home-based testing for cortisol. We propose a longitudinal study of 450 HIV-infected BMSM and WMSM who have common stress-related comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, depression, substance abuse) assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Participants will provide 9 days of smartphone- based EMA and MEMS for ART medication adherence every 6 months for 24 months. Every 6 months, we will collect stress and immune function biomarkers. Relevance The proposed research will enhance the effectiveness of future interventions by increasing our understanding of MSM health disparities and which modifiable stressors are most strongly associated with the health of MSM, the context in which these stressors lead to HIV-related behaviors, and how resilience and specific types of social network support may have buffering and direct effects on well-being.","Health disparities, stress pathways, and stress-related comorbidities among MSM living with HIV",9765389,R01MD013495,"['Adrenal Glands ', ' suprarenal gland ', ' Adrenals ', '

"Socioeconomic Disparities in Cognitive and Neural Development in the First 3 years Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is associated with deleterious effects on cognitive development and academic achievement, which in turn have long-lasting ramifications for numerous physical and mental health outcomes across the lifespan. Yet, our understanding of the experiential, physiological, epigenetic and neural pathways through which socioeconomic disparities shape developmental processes is just beginning to emerge. The core contribution of the proposed research would be to further this understanding, by marrying state-of-the-art measurement of brain function, physiology and epigenetics with a sophisticated conceptual and empirical understanding of socioeconomic inequality and experience. In this project, we will investigate how distal factors like SES operate through more proximate factors such as the home language environment and perceived and physiologic stress, and how these proximate factors shape the development of distinct neural and cognitive systems. Two pathways are hypothesized. First, we predict that socioeconomic disparities in the quality and quantity of linguistic stimulation in the home lead to differences in the function of language-specific brain processes, which in turn lead to differences in child language development. Secondly, we predict that SES disparities in perceived stress as well as physiologic stress (cortisol, epigenetics) lead to differences in the function of memory-specific brain processes, which in turn lead to differences in child memory development. To test these hypotheses, a longitudinal study is proposed in which a socioeconomically diverse cohort of 200 children and their families will be followed from birth through age 3. The development of early language and memory skills will be tracked, along with family SES, the home language environment, perceived stress, stress physiology, epigenetics, and brain function. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Examine longitudinally from birth to 3 the relations among SES, language, memory and brain development. (2) Examine whether socioeconomic disparities in cognitive and brain development are mediated by (a) the home language environment and (b) perceived and physiologic stress. This innovative research will elucidate the pathways linking socioeconomic disparities to specific cognitive and neural outcomes. This is aligned with NICHD’s mission to assist children to “achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.” Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is associated with deleterious effects on cognitive development and academic achievement, which in turn have long-lasting ramifications for numerous physical and mental health outcomes. This research will elucidate how the home language environment, perceived stress, stress physiology, epigenetics and brain function shape these associations, from birth through age three. This information will be critical for the design of more precise preventive, screening and interventional strategies to prevent academic failure and ultimately foster healthy development for all children.",Socioeconomic Disparities in Cognitive and Neural Development in the First 3 years,9769827,R01HD093707,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Development ', ' Child Language ', ' EEG ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Language ', ' language learning ', ' language acquisition ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' Language Development ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Linguistic ', ' Linguistics ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Longevity ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Memory ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mission ', ' Model System ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Biological Models ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Distal ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' infancy ', ' infantile ', ' Childhood ', ' pediatric ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' event related potential ', ' Shapes ', ' Investigation ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' American ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Neural Development ', ' Structure ', ' prenatal ', ' unborn ', ' skills ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Developmental Process ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' NICHD ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Preventative screening ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Coupled ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cognitive system ', ' Neurocognition ', ' cognitive development ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Graduation Rates ', ' Attainment Rate ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' early life stress ', ' early life adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' early adversity ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2019,513925,0.05122155077610686
"Positive Social Determinants of Health and Blood Pressure among Young Black Women with a History of Early Life Stress ABSTRACT Black women have among the highest prevalence of hypertension of all other racial and ethnic groups in the world, and hypertension is a primary risk factor for other forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD) such as stroke. Twenty years of health disparities research has largely focused on studying the health behaviors of Black women with hypertension with little improvement in either their blood pressure or their overall CV health. An emerging area of CVD research shows that early life stress, like severe household dysfunction and child maltreatment, independently doubles the odds of CVD even after controlling for traditional risk behaviors. Yet, few studies have investigated the potential association of early life stress and hypertension in Black females. Even fewer studies have used a strengths-based approach to understand Black females who experience early life stress but maintain a healthy blood pressure. Individual, family and community supports are positive social determinants of health that may work together to buffer the negative effects of early life stress on blood pressure in Black females, but we know little about these relationships. To fill this gap, the overall goal of this descriptive, correlational study is to examine the influence of early life stress, defined as exposure to adverse childhood events (ACEs), on hypertension and determine the extent to which positive social determinants of health counter the effects of ACEs using data from 14 years of follow-up in 900 young Black women, ages 24- 32, who participated in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. The specific aims of this study are to (1) determine the relationship between cumulative positive social determinants of health at the individual (spirituality), family (parental relationships), and community (social connections) levels and severity of early life stress (ACEs) on both blood pressure and the absence of hypertension among Black females who experienced ACEs; and (2) explore the individual contribution of each positive social determinant of health and severity of early life stress (ACEs) on blood pressure and the absence of hypertension among Black females with a history of ACEs. This study may help to shift the paradigm of health disparities research to focus on leveraging strengths that may inform future tailored, culturally sensitive interventions to improve the CV health of Black women. In addition to supporting completion of the proposed study, this fellowship will support the development of an independent scientist by providing extensive 1:1 mentoring and training in health equity research, secondary data analysis of large datasets, and dissemination of scientific knowledge. These goals will be achieved in a strong research environment with a long history of NIH funding. Building on a strong clinical foundation in community- based primary care, this fellowship will provide the applicant with research training to prepare for a postdoctoral fellowship that builds on the proposed study to examine gene-environment interactions and CVD in populations of color. The fellowship and training goals will cultivate the applicant’s expertise in CVD, the biological effects of stress on women’s health, and the use of large databases to answer rigorous research questions. Public Health Relevance Statement Black women experience significantly higher rates of high blood pressure and heart disease than other females in the U.S. and these outcomes have improved minimally with current strategies for disease prevention. Using a novel strengths-based approach, the proposed study will explore positive social determinants of health, such as parental relationships and social connectedness, among a cohort of young Black women who have experienced early life stress, a well-documented risk factor for heart disease. Findings will inform future research aimed at reducing heart disease risk, including providing important data about the timing and content of future interventions, which will promote heart health and

"Social adversities, epigenetics, and the obesity epidemic Project Summary. This application is being submitted in response to PAR-16-355, Social Epigenomics Research Focused on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R01), and the overarching long-term goal of this research effort is to learn how to positively influence health trajectories, modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for obesity in youth. Obesity was selected as the primary health outcome as it is a health measure with widening racial/ethnic disparities over the past three decades, and it is a potent predictor of a host of negative social, educational, vocational, and health outcomes later in life. In this study we propose to leverage two ongoing prenatal cohorts in Florida and North Carolina, and recruit a sample of 470 pregnant women and follow their children to 24 months of age. The sample will be enriched for adversity in pregnancy and approximately evenly divided among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic subjects. We will assess the impact of mothers' prenatal stress on measures of DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which are homogenous in terms of cellular composition, and widely accepted as an optimal choice for examining in utero responses to stressors. In the epigenetic analyses we will use both targeted and big data approaches, using pyrosequencing to measure methylation of 31 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate ~90 known imprinted genes, and the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC (850k) bead chip for whole epigenome analyses. We will also assess maternal and child postnatal psychosocial stress exposure, and child growth in the first 24 months of life. Children who are overweight at any point during the first two years of life have an approximately six-fold increased risk for obesity at five years of age, and risk for chronic health problems across the lifecycle. The primary hypotheses of this study build on preliminary work from our group and include: 1) Maternal prenatal stress will be associated with increased DMRs regulating the expression of imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) DMR, increased methylation in Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CAMK4) gene, and methylation changes in novel CpG sites identified in the 850K analyses; 2) DNA methylation profile changes associated with prenatal stress will be related to alterations in gene expression; and 3) Methylation markers identified in Aim 1 will predict growth trajectories and measures of obesity at 24 months of age. Secondary analyses will examine several moderating factors, including: maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), maternal social supports, maternal postnatal psychosocial distress, postnatal offspring ACE, genetic variants, and relevant confounding variables. The mediating role of inflammatory markers will also be explored, and saliva DNA specimens will be collected on the full cohort at 24-months and 50 children at birth, allowing for tests of comparability of DNA methylation between HUVECs and saliva, and the stability of markers over time. Project Narrative. Chronic exposure to psychosocial stress often accompanies the experience of poverty and racial/ethnic minority status, and may be causally related to health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for negative health outcomes to learn how to best modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce

"Maternal Stress and Preterm Birth:  Role of Genome and Epigenome Project Summary/Abstract Preterm birth (PTB) is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the US and the globe, and can lead to a cascade of health problems later in life. Despite decades of research, our ability to predict and prevent PTB remains poor. Maternal stress preconception and during pregnancy is emerging as an important modifiable risk factor of PTB, but previous studies have yielded inconsistent findings. While methodological variations in study designs and stress measurements across studies may have contributed to these inconsistencies, another possibility, the individual difference in susceptibility to stress, has received increasing attention but has not yet been well studied. Research by others and us suggests that several factors are at play: gene × environment interactions may play an important role in PTB, maternal stress may lead to epigenetic changes, and maternal epigenetic alterations are associated with PTB; yet these data remain fragmented. This proposed study offers an exceptional opportunity to investigate these factors and fill in the aforementioned gaps to connect the dots. We propose to utilize the existing databases of the Boston Birth Cohort, including maternal stress data, genome-wide genotype data, epigenome-wide DNA methylation data as well as extensive covariables from 2,000 African American mothers (~800 PTBs). We aim to address the following novel aims: Aim 1. To study the interactions of maternal stress and maternal genome on PTB risk. We hypothesize that high levels of maternal stress (including self-reported psychosocial stress and physician-diagnosed emotional disorders preconception and during pregnancy) are associated with an increased risk of PTB, and that the associations between maternal stress and PTB are modified by maternal genotypes. Aim 2. To study the role of maternal epigenome in mediating maternal gene × stress interactions on PTB risk. We hypothesize that maternal DNA methylation (DNAm) can mediate the associations between maternal stress and PTB risk; as well as the associations between maternal gene × stress interactions and PTB risk, as identified in Aim 1. To address these aims, we will employ both a hypothesis-driven and a genome-wide approach, and will replicate our findings in independent multi-ethnic samples. While PTB will be the primary outcome, we will also explore PTB subtypes and related traits as the secondary outcomes. This proposed study would be the first to explore the complex interplay of maternal stress, genome, and epigenome on PTB in a high-risk US minority population. It will lay the groundwork to better understand the role of stress in PTB, especially individual susceptibility to stress and underlying epigenetic mechanisms. Findings from this study will be directly relevant to high risk urban, low income, African American populations, and may help to inform novel interventions to reduce the persistent and striking Black- White PTB disparity. Project Narrative / Relevance Preterm birth is a leading cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the US and the globe and can lead to a cascade of health problems later in life; however, our ability to predict and prevent preterm birth remains poor. By utilizing existing databases of a well-established U.S. birth cohort, this proposal will investigate maternal stress preconception and during pregnancy, the maternal genome and their interactions in relation to preterm birth, and examine how these relationships are mediated by maternal epigenetic changes.

"Neurophysiological mechanisms of Stress Coping Behaviors Abstract There are wide variations in behavioral responses to social stress. Some individuals successfully employ coping strategies in response to stress, and become resilient. In others, social stress can precipitate psychiatric dysfunction, such as depression and anxiety. While coping mechanisms are known to be crucial for the maintenance of healthy mental functioning and a proper, successful coping strategy decreases the impact of stress and protects from long-term pathological states, there is less known about the neurophysiological basis of how this occurs. Importantly, it is clinically evident that vulnerability to stress-induced neuropsychiatric diseases is highly individual and may in part depend on these coping style. Human studies suggest that passive coping during stressful life events is associated with the development of stress-induced depression, whereas proactive coping is correlated with resiliency. Interestingly, males and females demonstrate different social stress coping strategies, suggesting potentially non-overlapping neural circuitry adaptations occurring in response to stress. Despite these clear gender differences and the increased incidence of major depression in females, translational work in this field has focused primarily on males. Identifying the neurobiological gender differences in stress coping responses may inform greatly needed mechanistically driven therapeutics for depression. The animal models proposed in this award will provide crucial mechanistic and neural circuit understanding of stress coping strategies influence on the stress response. Vulnerability to stress-induced diseases is highly individual and may in part depend on variable coping styles. Following repeated stress, there is increased arousal, expectancy and anxiety. It is these functions that facilitate coping at the circuit level, therefore our work focuses on those related brain regions. Recent studies have revealed the critical and opposing roles of the anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Furthermore, the BNST projects to and regulates the firing of dopaminergic cells via GABAergic interneurons within the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a region which has been shown to be linked to stress-related depressive phenotype. Thus the VTA projecting BNST neurons are uniquely positioned to receive stress axis information and integrate it into reward/motivation circuitry. The two specific aims outlined this proposal will fully characterize these behavioral models and identify neurophysiological changes that occur within the BNST-VTA pathway Research leading towards further understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms of active stress coping strategies, and how they can enhance resistance to stress induced depression may provide novel pharmacological targets to enhance coping skills and reverse depressive symptoms. In summary, the research proposed in this Support of Competitive Research Pilot Project Award (SC2) is critical for the development of my independent research path. This mechanism will provide the financial, and mentorship support for the next steps in my career at Hunter College at the City University of New York.   Relevance statement Stress induced depression has a tremendous negative impact on the health of the individual and society. The research generated in this proposal will investigate a discrete neural circuit that mediates differential responses to stress, dependent on sex and coping strategy. These data will shed light on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the differences in stress response in males and females and may lead to the development of potential targeted therapeutics to treat depression.",Neurophysiological mechanisms of Stress Coping Behaviors,9689024,SC2GM122646,"['Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cities ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Depressive disorder ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Dopamine ', ' electrophysiological ', ' Neurophysiology / Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology ', ' Electrophysiology (science) ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' glutamatergic ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' Glutamates ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Interneurons ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Maintenance ', ' male ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Motivation ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' NIMH ', ' National Institute of Mental Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neuronal ', ' Neurocyte ', ' Neural Cell ', ' Nerve Unit ', ' Nerve Cells ', ' Neurons ', ' neurophysiological ', ' neurophysiology ', ' New York ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Phenotype ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Play ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Coping Skills ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Ventral Tegmental Area ', ' ventral tegmentum ', ' avoidance behavior ', ' career ', ' Anterior ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Structure of terminal stria nuclei of preoptic region ', ' Stria Terminalis Nucleus ', ' Bed Nucleus of Stria Terminalis ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Event ', ' cell type ', ' Techniques ', ' Viral ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' sexual dimorphism ', ' sexually dimorphic ', ' sex dimorphism ', ' Animal Model ', ' model organism ', ' model of animal ', ' Animal Models and Related Studies ', ' novel ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' neural circuit ', ' synaptic circuitry ', ' synaptic circuit ', ' neural circuitry ', ' dopaminergic neuron ', ' Dopamine neuron ', ' DA Neuron ', ' Modeling ', ' Property ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' major depression disorder ', ' major depression ', ' clinical depression ', ' Major Depressive Disorder ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Dopaminergic Cell ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Pathologic ', ' sex ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' reward circuitry ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' neuronal excitability ', ' resilience ', ' Expectancy ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Resistance ', ' resistant ', ' translational study ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' neuroadaptation ', ' neural adaptation ', ' coping mechanism ', ' targeted treatment ', ' targeted therapy ', ' targeted therapeutic agents ', ' targeted therapeutic ', ' targeted drug treatments ', ' targeted drug therapy ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' behavioral study ', ' behavior study ', ' mental function ', ' neuropsychiatric disorder ', ' neuropsychiatric disease ', ' gender difference ', ' gender-associated difference ', ' gender disparity ', ' ']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,SC2,2019,156000,0.09509726471830685
"Mindfulness-intervention to Address PTSD in Trauma-exposed, Homeless Women ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health concern that disproportionately effects minorities and those with low-socioeconomic status, such as homeless women, creating a critical health disparity. PTSD has been linked with dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning and increased inflammation, which can lead to long-term physical-health problems and PTSD-symptom maintenance, exacerbating disparities. Mindfulness-based interventions, including Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR), have shown promise as a complementary tool for addressing PTSD in veterans and with low-income, minority populations, but homeless women have not been examined adequately. MBSR may improve PTSD symptomatology and help modulate the dysregulated stress response common in individuals with PTSD, improving physical and mental health concurrently. This project proposes a mixed-methods, open-label, parallel, randomized-clinical trial of a modified-MBSR intervention to reduce PTSD symptoms in homeless women and to explore physiological correlates of treatment-response. Inclusion criteria will be currently homeless women, age 18-64, with clinically-significant PTSD as defined by standard guidelines. Phase I will be a qualitative study to refine MBSR for cultural-appropriateness in a high-minority community and to address the specific needs of homeless women. In Phase II, participants will be randomly assigned to the MBSR-based intervention or a health promotion attention-control group. At baseline, women will complete psychosocial assessments (e.g., depression, substance use, trauma history) and participate in a brief stress task, providing salivary samples before and after the task (which will be assayed for cortisol and C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation). Women will then participate in the 9-week MBSR-based program or health-promotion control group. Follow-up assessments that include psychosocial and biological data will occur immediately after final intervention session and again 6-months later. Clinically-meaningful improvements in PTSD (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes (e.g., depression, substance use, inflammation, cortisol reactivity) will then be examined. The candidate’s training plan capitalizes on the expertise of a diverse mentoring team, integrating advanced training in mixed-methods research, community-based clinical trials, mindfulness-based interventions, and salivary biosciences. The plan includes didactic courses and on-one-one mentoring at the University of California, Irvine (mixed-methods, qualitative design, clinical trials, and salivary bioscience) and Loma Linda University (MBIs), both in Southern California. The training plan also includes in-depth workshops in each substantive area and in training in the responsible conduct of research. The candidate will complete the K01 with expertise in mixed- methods, biopsychosocial approaches to address PTSD in populations with high health-disparities.

"Stress and the Genome: Testing the Impact of Social Effects on Gene Regulation Project Summary  The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and well being. Chronic social stress and reduced access to social support are strongly linked to major diseases of aging; as a result, social adversity is highly predictive of life expectancy itself. Recent evidence suggests that, while some of this relationship is explained by correlated factors such as smoking, obesity, and health care access, social stressors also have a direct impact on physiological function. Indeed, work in animal models has clearly demonstrated that the experience of social subordination alone can alter the function of the immune system, in part by altering gene regulation in immune cells.  The goal of the proposed research is to address a key outstanding question that arises from these findings: when, and for whom, are chronic social stress effects on immune function most important? To do so, it will take advantage of dominance rank in female rhesus macaques as a model for chronic social stressor exposure in humans. Rhesus macaque females are excellent models for human social stress because they naturally organize into dominance rank hierarchies in which low ranking individuals experience increased rates of harassment, reduced social affiliation, and physiological markers of rank-related stress. Importantly, dominance rank assignments, and thus an individual's exposure to social stressors, can be manipulated in this species by manipulating group membership. Such manipulations yield a powerful experimental model for investigating the consequences of socially induced stress—an approach that is directly translatable to humans, but that is practically and ethically impossible in humans themselves.  The proposed study will take advantage of this model to investigate how differential exposure to dominance rank-induced social stress causally influences gene expression in the immune system. Specifically, it will use an in vitro approach to efficiently screen for condition-specific social stress effects on gene expression levels across 30 physiologically relevant environmental conditions (e.g., pathogen exposure, steroid hormone signaling). It will complement the in vitro screen with an in vivo test of the gene regulatory and antibody response to influenza vaccination, a medical procedure in which variable responses are of particular concern as individuals age. Finally, it will test whether age, social behavior, and genotype can be used to predict interindividual variation in the strength of social stressor effects on immune regulation, and hence which individuals are most vulnerable. Together, the proposed analyses will provide much-needed insight into the factors that explain when and why individuals differ in their response to the same social stressors, as well as the potential consequences of these differences for medical treatment. The project's results will therefore have direct translational application to both identifying the most susceptible members of our aging population and suggesting tailored strategies for intervention. Project Narrative The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and wellbeing, with particularly strong predictive power for diseases of aging and mortality risk itself. This project uses a nonhuman primate model for human social stress, the rhesus macaque, to investigate the factors that explain interindividual variation in the impact of social stress on the genome, including the conditions under which these effects are most important. The results of this project will contribute to understanding how social stress influences disease susceptibility and how to identify those who are most vulnerable to its negative effects.",Stress and

"Social adversities, epigenetics, and the obesity epidemic Project Summary. This application is being submitted in response to PAR-16-355, Social Epigenomics Research Focused on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R01), and the overarching long-term goal of this research effort is to learn how to positively influence health trajectories, modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for obesity in youth. Obesity was selected as the primary health outcome as it is a health measure with widening racial/ethnic disparities over the past three decades, and it is a potent predictor of a host of negative social, educational, vocational, and health outcomes later in life. In this study we propose to leverage two ongoing prenatal cohorts in Florida and North Carolina, and recruit a sample of 470 pregnant women and follow their children to 24 months of age. The sample will be enriched for adversity in pregnancy and approximately evenly divided among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic subjects. We will assess the impact of mothers' prenatal stress on measures of DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which are homogenous in terms of cellular composition, and widely accepted as an optimal choice for examining in utero responses to stressors. In the epigenetic analyses we will use both targeted and big data approaches, using pyrosequencing to measure methylation of 31 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate ~90 known imprinted genes, and the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC (850k) bead chip for whole epigenome analyses. We will also assess maternal and child postnatal psychosocial stress exposure, and child growth in the first 24 months of life. Children who are overweight at any point during the first two years of life have an approximately six-fold increased risk for obesity at five years of age, and risk for chronic health problems across the lifecycle. The primary hypotheses of this study build on preliminary work from our group and include: 1) Maternal prenatal stress will be associated with increased DMRs regulating the expression of imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) DMR, increased methylation in Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CAMK4) gene, and methylation changes in novel CpG sites identified in the 850K analyses; 2) DNA methylation profile changes associated with prenatal stress will be related to alterations in gene expression; and 3) Methylation markers identified in Aim 1 will predict growth trajectories and measures of obesity at 24 months of age. Secondary analyses will examine several moderating factors, including: maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), maternal social supports, maternal postnatal psychosocial distress, postnatal offspring ACE, genetic variants, and relevant confounding variables. The mediating role of inflammatory markers will also be explored, and saliva DNA specimens will be collected on the full cohort at 24-months and 50 children at birth, allowing for tests of comparability of DNA methylation between HUVECs and saliva, and the stability of markers over time. Project Narrative. Chronic exposure to psychosocial stress often accompanies the experience of poverty and racial/ethnic minority status, and may be causally related to health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for negative health outcomes to learn how to best modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce health disparities.","Social adversities, epigenetics, and the obesity epidemic",9702092,R01MD011746,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Ca(2+)-Calmodulin Dependent Protein

"Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors Project Summary/Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and debilitating age-related health condition contributing toward physical and psychosocial decline, reduced quality of life, and rising national expenses. Considerable evidence demonstrates health disparities in the burdens of living with OA. Specifically, African Americans with knee OA experience greater clinical pain, functional limitations, and decreased quality of life compared to non-Hispanic whites. Pain is a key factor contributing to functional limitations and physical disability. Psychosocial stress predicts the onset of chronic pain and living with chronic pain contributes to increased psychosocial stress. Ethnic groups differ in environmental and sociocultural stress exposures. Importantly, the body is designed to adapt and strengthen with adequate recovery in response stress. However, persistent stress can take a toll on the system resulting in dysregulation and dysfunction known as allostatic load. Persistent stress and chronic pain contribute toward altered functioning across multiple biological systems including the brain. Structural and functional changes and accelerated aging in the brain have been observed among individuals with chronic pain, including those with knee OA. Altered stress-related biological functioning has also been indicated in individuals with chronic pain. These biological changes likely contribute to increased morbidity and mortality among those with chronic pain and OA. What is not known however is whether: 1) African Americans and non- Hispanic whites with knee OA differ across biological measures of aging, 2) biological measures of aging are inter-related, and 3) biological measures of aging predict ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. Importantly, there is evidence that health promoting behaviors and psychosocial factors may modulate the biological consequences of OA-related pain and stress. We will investigate a comprehensive array of biopsychosocial measures across three time points in a four year longitudinal analysis of 200 adults with knee OA (100 African Americans and 100 non-Hispanic whites) to determine the influence of stress exposure on measures of biological aging (allostatic load, telomere length, and brain structure/function), and the relationship between biological measures of aging and ethnic group differences in knee OA health outcomes. We will also evaluate the possible modulating effect of risk and resilience factors. Findings will 1) contribute to an improved understanding of the stress, resilience, aging, and health outcome dynamic; 2) promote the identification of biological markers sensitive to stress related exposure and indicative of health- related system functioning; and 3) elucidate resilience factors that may serve as clinical targets to reduce ethnic group disparities in OA and improve overall health outcomes. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis is a prevalent and debilitating age-related condition that unequally burdens African American adults compared to non-Hispanic white adults. There is a gap in knowledge regarding the transition from stress exposure to disparities in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. The goal of this project is to investigate the trajectory from stress exposure to biological measures of aging and stress-related system dysregulation (allostatic load, telomere length, changes in brain structure/function) to ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes over a four year period. The long-term intention is to identify strategies to reduce the burden and improve health outcomes for adults with osteoarthritis.","Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors",9707686,R01AG054370,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Buffers ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' brain blood flow ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' substantia grisea ', ' gray matter ', ' Health ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' structure function relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' chronic pain ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Human body ', ' Human Figure ', ' Biological Process ', ' Biological Function ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee OA ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostatic load ', ' age related ', ' age dependent ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biological systems ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' stress symptom ', ' chronic musculoskeletal pain ', ' chronic MSK pain ', ' clinical pain ', ' osteoarthritis pain ', ' protective factors ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2019,694773,-0.10155775256260328
"Precarious Employment as a Determinant of Overweight and Cardiometabolic Risk PROJECT SUMMARY Reducing obesity disparities could greatly reduce health disparities by race/ethnicity for the leading cause of death in the U.S., cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, it is critical to understand the systemic causes of disparities in obesity prevalence between racial/ethnic minority adults and children, compared to their white counterparts. “Precarious employment,” which is often characterized by low wages, limited fringe benefits, shorter tenure, and irregular hours, making employment risky and stressful for the worker, is disproportionately represented among racial/ethnic minorities. Precarious employment may increase body mass index through multiple mechanisms including, a biological stress response. Determining the extent to which precarious employment is a determinate of overweight and cardiometabolic risk is vitally important for mitigating disparities in chronic disease risk and informing structural approaches for improving population health in the U.S. The proposed work in this Pathway to Independence Award builds upon my current program of research investigating the role of employment status and conditions in overweight risk and enhances it by adding training in areas that are critical to accomplishing my career goal: establishing an independent research program that rigorously investigates the role of employment status and conditions as a determinate of racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease risk. The training portion of this project includes coursework, guided readings, and career- building activities to gain skills in three areas: 1) causal inference methodologies; 2) the study of stress and CVD, and 3) racial/ethnic health disparities. The newly acquired skills and knowledge obtained during the training phase of this award will be applied in the research phase of the study. The research phase of the study aims to provide novel insights into the impacts of precarious employment on overweight and cardiometabolic risk, and to investigate the pathways of these relationships. We will leverage three unique datasets, two racially/ethnically diverse longitudinal cohorts with complementary employment and biological data (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health), and objective data on work activities and organization (Occupational Information Network Database), to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) determine the extent to which precarious employment affects overweight/obesity risk among adults and children in the U.S. and examine whether any association varies by race/ethnicity; 2) determine whether biological stress mediates the association between precarious employment and BMI and overweight/obesity risk among adults; 3) determine whether precarious employment is associated with cardiometabolic risk biomarkers among adults and examine whether any association varies by race/ethnicity; and 3a) determine whether overweight/obesity and biological stress mediate the association between precarious employment and cardiometabolic risk. Employment precariousness is modifiable through policy-level changes, making this a critical topic for study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reducing obesity disparities could greatly reduce health disparities by race/ethnicity for the leading cause of death in the U.S., cardiovascular disease.

"A mixed-methods approach to understanding stress and hazardous drinking among same-sex female couples PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Sexual minority women (SMW; e.g., lesbian, bisexual) are 6-7 times as likely as heterosexual women to meet criteria for alcohol use disorder, indicating a disproportionately high risk of hazardous drinking (HD) and associated negative health outcomes. SMW's elevated HD risk is believed to be caused, in large part, by lifetime exposure to multiple and chronic stressors. Although the association between stress and HD is well-established, little is known about how relationship characteristics influence stress and HD among SMW. Intimate relationships confer many benefits and are protective against stress-related negative health outcomes. Conversely, relationship stress may lead to unhealthy coping behaviors, such as HD. The proposed study aims to understand the role of HD within same-sex female couples using both qualitative and quantitative data at both the individual- and couple-levels. The specific aims for the K99 phase are to: 1) Explore associations among couple-level relationship factors, stressors, and HD; and 2) Identify individual-level experiences within same-sex female couples that influence drinking behaviors. The major goals of this Pathway to Independence Award are the acceleration and completion of Dr. Cindy Veldhuis' training in alcohol-related research and the launching of her career as an independent scientist with a tenure-track assistant professor position. Dr. Veldhuis is a psychologist and a postdoctoral fellow funded by an NIH/NIAAA F32 National Service Research Award (F32AA025816) at Columbia University. The two-year K99 phase will complete Dr. Veldhuis' training in sexual-orientation-related health disparities in HD. With mentorship, Dr. Veldhuis will: 1) recruit and interview a sample of same-sex female couples (N=50 couples) from the New York City area; 2) use a mixed-methods approach to examine HD and stress within couples to understand predictors of HD in this at-risk population; 3) attend courses, seminars, and conferences related to alcohol use and misuse, sexual minority health, mixed-methods and dyadic analyses, and professional development; 4) lead her own study on SMW's health; 5) disseminate her findings; and 6) secure a tenure-track faculty position at a research-intensive university. The proposed primary mentor Dr. John Pachankis, co-mentors Dr. LeBlanc and Dr. Hughes, and advisory panel members Drs. Stone, George, Keyes, and Schrimshaw are experts in key components of the proposed K99/R00 and collectively provide expertise ideally suited to facilitate the successful completion of the proposed training and research activities. Columbia University is one of the world's most respected research centers and a world-class institution, and thus has the resources needed for successful completion of the training (K99) phase of this proposed award. The three-year R00 phase will allow Dr. Veldhuis to: 1) recruit a geographically and demographically diverse national sample of same-sex female couples (N = 300 couples); 2) test a theoretical framework informed by the K99 findings using empirically validated individual- and couple-level measures; 3) establish her program of research and laboratory; and 4) submit an R01 to NIH/NIAAA. The proposed study extends findings from Dr. Veldhuis' F32 to understand how individual- and couple- level characteristics of same-sex relationships influence HD and will provide preliminary data for her R01 application. PROJECT NARRATIVE Sexual minority women (SMW; e.g., lesbian, bisexual) are at disproportionately high risk of hazardous drinking (HD) and associated negative health outcomes compared to heterosexual women, likely due to their higher lifetime exposure to multiple and chronic stressors. Although there is a great deal of literature demonstrating that close, intimate relationships buffer stress among women in the general population, very little research has investigated HD within SMW's intimate relationships.

"Testing a Biopsychosocial Model of Minority Stress and Health for HIV-Positive Men Project Summary Gay and bisexual men (GBM) in the U.S. are burdened by a high and disproportionate rate of HIV infection and more than half of all HIV+ individuals are GBM. Improving viral load (VL) suppression is associated with a significant reduction in the sexual transmission of HIV. Moreover, research is needed to better understand the modifiable social and behavioral factors that influence their long-term health. Chronic experiences of sexual minority stressors (e.g., internalized homonegativity) have been shown to influence a variety of mental, behavioral, and physical health outcomes for GBM, including general stress (e.g., cortisol) and immune (e.g., cytokines) outcomes, as well as HIV-specific health outcomes (e.g., CD4 count) among HIV+ GBM. Chronic experiences of HIV-related stressors have also been shown to impact mental health and health behaviors for HIV+ GBM, though there is substantially less research on their role in the health of HIV+ GBM. Previous research, including our own, has shown that fluctuations in sexual minority and HIV-specific stressors (i.e., acute experiences of these stressors) are measurable and meaningfully associated with health outcomes. Both HIV infection and substance use are associated with declines in neurocognitive function and emerging evidence suggests that emotional processing may help explain the impact of psychological phenomena on health outcomes. To develop interventions that are robust and durable, research is needed that examines the unique and overlapping influence of sexual minority and HIV-related stressors on health outcomes for HIV+ GBM within a unified biopsychosocial model. Such a model should take into account both individual-level (i.e., chronic) and situational (i.e., acute) experiences of these stressors to examine their independent associations with health, and should consider whether emotional interference in cognitive processing might moderate these associations. Aim 1 of the study is to test a biopsychosocial model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress and health, examining direct and indirect effects of these stressors on each outcome. Aim 2 is to test the moderating role of emotional interference in cognitive processing on these associations. Finally, Aim 3 is to examine the extent of intraindividual variability over one year in sexual minority and HIV-related stressors, VL, CD4, and cytokines. Although not an aim, the study will culminate in the development of guidelines for future intervention development and we will gather participant feedback on these recommendations. To accomplish these aims, we will enroll 250 HIV+ GBM and follow them for 12 months. We will use ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over one year to test the impact of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on physiological stress (diurnal cortisol) and long-term immune outcomes (VL suppression, CD4 count, cytokines). This study will address novel questions about the relative role of sexual minority and HIV-related stress in the health of HIV+ GBM to guide the development of interventions to improve health and reduce HIV transmission, morbidity, and mortality among HIV+ GBM. Project Narrative Sexual minority stress is an established contributor to poorer behavioral, mental, and physical health for gay and bisexual men, though the role of HIV-related stress within these models has gone largely unexplored. We will test a unified model of sexual minority and HIV-related stress on biomarkers of physiological stress (i.e., cortisol) and immune (i.e., viral load, CD4, cytokines) responses using twice-daily ecological momentary assessment (EMA) for 21 days and quarterly longitudinal follow-ups over 12 months to prospectively test the proposed model. We will use self-reported surveys and neurocognitive assessments to quantitatively examine the impact of these stressors on HIV-related health outcomes, and end by developing guidelines to inform the development of future interventions aimed at improving HIV treatment and prevent HIV transmission.",Testing a Biopsychosocial Model of Minority Stress and Health for HIV-Positive Men,9977286,R01MH114735,"['Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome ', ' AIDS ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immuno-Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Acquired Immunologic Deficiency Syndrome ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seronegativities ', ' HIV negative ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativities ', ' HTLV-III Seronegativity ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Immune System Diseases ', ' Immune Diseases ', ' Immune Disorders ', ' Immune Dysfunction ', ' Immune System Disorder ', ' Immune System Dysfunction ', ' Immune System and Related Disorders ', ' Immunodeficiency and Immunosuppression Disorders ', ' Immunologic Diseases ', ' Immunological Diseases ', ' Immunological Dysfunction ', ' Immunological System Dysfunction ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Learning ', "" Men's Role "", ' male role ', ' role men ', ' Short-Term Memory ', ' Immediate Memory ', ' Shortterm Memory ', ' working memory ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Morbidity -

"Cortisol Synchrony in Adolescents and Their Parents PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite their citizenship, over 3.2 million US-born Latino children of undocumented parents (i.e., those in “mixed-status families”) experience chronic stress associated with potential or actual forced deportation of their parents. Relative to US-born Latino children in documented-status families, US-born Latino children in mixed- status families are exposed to additional acute and chronic stressors placing them at elevated risk for substance use, anxiety and depression. The absence of research using direct assessment of family documentation status impedes the ability to determine structural burden of stress exposure and its health consequences. Further, chronic stress, such as the burden of deportation stress within immigrant families, can be culturally bound and standardized survey measures may not be indicative of the negative health impact that physiological stress has within the family environment. The objective of this study is to determine the potential mental and behavioral health vulnerabilities of US-born Latino adolescents (ages 12- 16) with undocumented parents. This will be done through a dyadic bio-behavioral project based on central principles of community– based research. The primary aim is to describe cortisol synchrony in Latino adolescent-parent dyads, and compare the synchrony profiles of dyads in mixed-status families with those in documented families. Aim 2 is to delineate variability in self-appraised stressors among mixed-status and documented-status US-born Latino adolescent-immigrant parent dyads. Aim 3 will describe the magnitude of correlations of cortisol synchrony with parent and adolescent self-appraised stressors and youth self-reports of substance use, anxiety, and depression. This study will enroll n=25 US-born Mexican adolescent-immigrant parent dyads from mixed-status families and n=25 US-born Mexican adolescent-immigrant parent dyads from documented-status families who reside in the Houston-area. Direct assessments and self-reported surveys will be utilized. Saliva samples will be assayed for cortisol. Adolescents and parents will report on deportation stress, acculturative stress (SAFE- R), and economic stress (HSI-A and HSI-2 subscales). Adolescents will also report on substance use, anxiety (PAI), and depression (CES-D). This study is highly innovative for three reasons: (1) Explicit focus on a dominant contemporary issue – the management of US-born children and their undocumented immigrant parents – advanced under the previous administration but currently being called into question; (2) While there is a long history of studies focused on individuals' diurnal pattern of cortisol, there is a dearth of research using a dyadic bio-behavioral approach to capture cortisol synchrony among adolescent-immigrant parent households; and (3) A refinement in methodologies by using complementary objective and subjective assessments of stress to avoid potential ambiguity in health effects, recognizing that deportation stress is culturally bound. This study has implications to inform future community-based research projects focused on US-born children of undocumented immigrant parents, one of the fastest growing segments of the US. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stress association with potential or actual forced deportation is currently high; yet there is little scientific evidence for quantifying this burden within family units of US-born Latino children with an undocumented parent (i.e. “mixed-status” family). Using a dyadic bio-behavioral approach, this study will describe the cortisol synchrony of US-born children in mixed-status families to that of US-born children in documented-status families. This type research is needed because the 3.2 million US-born children of immigrant Latinos are one of the fastest growing segments of the U.S. population, and are at elevated risk for experiencing poor mental and behavioral health because of the stress within the family environment associated with deportation policies.",Cortisol Synchrony in Adolescents and Their Parents,9889157,R03HD098379,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disclosure ', ' Information Disclosure ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Production ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Saliva ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' insight ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' intervention program ', ' Proxy ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' member ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Documentation ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF HOUSTON,R03,2020,78772,0.04042194168040708
"Molecular Epidemiology of Oxidative Stress and Related Cancers in Black Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oxidative stress is defined as an ""imbalance in pro-oxidants and antioxidants with associated disruption of redox circuitry and macromolecular damage"". Chronic oxidative stress is believed to increase the risk of many cancers such as breast and colorectal cancers. Despite being at increased risk of developing and dying from oxidative-stress related cancers, African-Americans are under-represented in population-based studies of oxidative stress and cancer. This is especially true for biomarker-based and nutritional epidemiology studies of oxidative stress. This career development award is designed to provide training and research experience to Dr. Dash to support his goal of becoming an independent researcher investigating the molecular epidemiology of cancers among minorities including cancer disparities. Proposed training plans include mentorship and coursework in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and exploratory data analysis, filling gaps in research training related to studies among minorities and health disparity studies, and research considerations in recruitment and bio specimen collection from minorities in epidemiologic research. The research component of the proposal aims to address the research gaps mentioned above by (1) characterizing the systemic oxidative stress burden via measurement of a panel of known biomarkers of oxidative stress using proteomics and metabolomics technologies; (2) identifying dietary patterns associated with oxidative stress; and (3) investigating the association of these dietary patterns with risk of breast and colorectal cancers among African- American women. The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 involves measurement of a panel of 6 oxidative stress biomarkers using proteomic and metabolomic approaches and describing the oxidative stress burden among African-American women without cancer. Dietary patterns related to the biomarkers of oxidative stress will also be identified usin dietary intake data self-reported by participants on food frequency questionnaires. Phase 2 of the study involves investigating the association of the oxidative stress-related dietary patterns developed in Phase 1 with breast and colon cancer risk in a large, nationally-representative, cohort study of Black women. Results from the study will support larger and more definitive studies on oxidative stress and cancer among African-American women. The proposed research complements the training and mentorship plans in proteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, biostatistics, and minority health research. With this award Dr. Chiranjeev Dash will combine his previous training in epidemiology with advanced training in metabolomics/proteomics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics, and gain experience in conduct of minority health research to establish an independent research career focusing on translational research on the molecular epidemiology of oxidative stress in cancer causation and prevention. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research addresses a priority area for the National Cancer Institute, minority health research and research to reduce cancer health disparities. This study focuses on studying the molecular epidemiology of oxidative stress and cancer among African-American women, an underserved minority group who have been under-represented in biomarker-based oxidative stress and cancer research. The study will provide data on the role of dietary patterns in oxidative stress and investigate whether oxidative stress-associated dietary patterns are associated with breast and colon cancer risk among African- American women.",Molecular Epidemiology of Oxidative Stress and Related Cancers in Black Women,9906186,K07CA197112,"['Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Award ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Colorectal Neoplasms ', ' Colorectal Tumors ', ' Large Bowel Tumor ', ' Large Intestine Neoplasm ', ' Large Intestine Tumor ', ' colo-rectal neoplasia ', ' colo-rectal neoplasms ', ' colo-rectal tumors ', ' colorectal neoplasia ', ' large bowel neoplasm ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Cysteine ', ' Half-Cystine ', ' L-Cysteine ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.

"Trajectories of Adaptation to Traumatic Stress in a Vulnerable Population Transgender individuals are disproportionately burdened by chronic (e.g., interpersonal rejection) and acute (victimization) discrimination. According to minority stress theory, both forms of discrimination are associated with adverse mental health outcomes including PTSD, a stress sensitive disorder that may arise from exposure to life-threatening events, serious injury, or sexual assault. While PTSD effects an estimated 6.8% of the U.S. general population, prevalence estimates in transgender samples range from 18%-61%. Arguably, both PTSD and chronic and persistent threats to one’s identity in the form of everyday discrimination produce similar stress responses. Exposure to daily discrimination may also exacerbate traumatic stress responses for transgender people already exposed to traumatic stressors. However, the unique and interactive effects of these stressors are poorly understood, particularly among transgender individuals. Understanding the impact of daily discrimination on the onset, maintenance, and course of PTSD in the acute aftermath of trauma exposure has been stymied by reliance on cross-sectional and self-report methods. Longitudinal studies are needed to elucidate temporal pathways among traumatic stress, daily discrimination, and PTSD. Further, given that the leading explanatory theory for minority health disparities proposes that stressors associated with minority status lead to negative mental health outcomes through a host of shared mechanisms inter- and intrapersonal mechanisms, it is important to conduct research with gender minorities to understand the unique processes that contribute to observed disparities. Whereas the majority of transgender individuals demonstrate resilience in a context of pervasive societal oppression, uncovering biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying vulnerability to and protection against chronic trauma-related distress and functional impairment represents a key research priority. The goal of this SC3 is to fill a substantial gap in the science of adaptation to traumatic stress by examining trajectories and mechanisms of risk and resilience among transgender individuals assessed using a multimethod longitudinal approach. The PI will recruit a diverse sample of trauma-exposed transgender individuals in New York City to participate in a multimethod longitudinal research protocol. Participants who enroll in the study will complete a gold-standard clinical interview to assess PTSD symptoms and provide a salivary cortisol sample within 1-month of trauma exposure, and again at a 3, 6, and 12-month follow-up assessments. For 14-days following the baseline, 3, and 6-month assessment session, participants will also complete daily diary measures assessing degree and type of exposure to daily discrimination and putative intra- and interpersonal mechanisms of risk and resilience responses to traumatic stress. Findings from the study will culminate in the development of research and practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of PTSD among those exposed to ongoing gender-related stigma and stress. Transgender individuals are disproportionately burdened by chronic discrimination and traumatic victimization, both of which are associated with adverse mental health outcomes including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the unique and interactive effects of daily discrimination and trauma exposure are poorly understood, particularly among transgender individuals. The proposed research project, which will examine trajectories and markers of risk and resilience among transgender trauma survivors using a multimethod longitudinal approach, will rigorously assess the impact of daily discrimination and traumatic stress responses in this high-need population, informing PTSD prevention and intervention efforts.",Trajectories of Adaptation to Traumatic Stress in a Vulnerable Population,9935212,SC3GM136580,"['Affect ', ' Cognition ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Maintenance ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' New York City ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Practice Guidelines ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Survivors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' assaulted sexually ', ' sexual attack ', ' sexual assault ', ' Individual ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Victimization ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Pattern ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Subgroup ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' salivary immunoassay ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Prevention Guidelines ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' Trauma ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' high risk ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' gender minority ', ' recruit ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' traumatic stress ', ' posttrauma exposure ', ' post-trauma exposure ', ' ']",NIGMS,HUNTER COLLEGE,SC3,2020,117000,0.10676771956955805
"Investigating the Neurodevelopmental Effects of Pyrethroid Pesticide and Stress Exposure On the Dopamine System in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder PROJECT SUMMARY Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) affects approximately 7% of children, making it one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders worldwide. ADHD presents a significant public health burden because the disorder causes hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention symptoms that affect individuals in social, academic, and occupational settings, and can affect individuals well into adulthood. To date, no singular pathogenic cause of ADHD has been found and ADHD etiology is most likely multifactorial. While most patients with ADHD are treated with the stimulant methylphenidate, long-term use is associated with cognitive side effects and substance abuse, and significantly decreased quality of life still occurs. Elucidating the etiology and pathogenesis of ADHD is therefore imperative. Our group recently showed that exposure to pyrethroid pesticides induces alterations in dopaminergic proteins and ADHD-like behaviors in a mouse model. Interestingly, pyrethroid pesticide exposure is higher in low socioeconomic status populations, and these populations are also at increased risk of ADHD. Low socioeconomic status populations also experience greater amounts of chronic psychosocial stress, which alters the dopaminergic system in a rodent model. Thus, certain populations of children may be exposed to both pyrethroid pesticides and chronic psychosocial stress, two environmental exposures that are known to change components of the dopamine system. We thus hypothesize that the combined dopaminergic effects of pyrethroid pesticide and stress exposure will lead to additive effects on the dopamine system, ultimately increasing the risk of developing ADHD. We will test this hypothesis through the following aims. Aim 1 is to determine the neurobehavioral and neuropathologic effects of combined neurodevelopmental pyrethroid and corticosterone exposure in mice. More specifically, we will assess behavioral and neurochemical changes that occur in the dopamine system in response to pyrethroid pesticide and stress hormone exposure alone and in combination from gestation through adulthood. To do so, we will utilize a neurodevelopmental mouse model that we previously validated for examination of dopamine-related changes after pyrethroid pesticide exposure. Aim 2 is to determine whether key dopaminergic regions exhibit altered levels of DNA methylation in response to combined neurodevelopmental pyrethroid and corticosterone exposure in mice. To study these epigenetic effects, we will utilize the neurodevelopmental mouse model described in Aim 1, isolate midbrain tissue, and use targeted next-generation sequencing to assess whether DNA methylation changes at key dopaminergic gene regions. Altogether, this research will yield important mechanistic insight into the consequences of pyrethroid and stress hormone exposures in the dopaminergic system, in the context of neurodevelopment and ADHD. Understanding mechanisms of ADHD etiology and pathogenesis will provide valuable information for development of more effective ADHD pharmacotherapies and behavioral interventions, as well as the implementation of diagnostic screening targeted towards at-risk populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder impacts the academic, social, and occupational function of 7% of children around the world. Environmental exposures have been linked to risk of developing this disease but have mostly been studied in isolation. Here, we will investigate the effects of two environmental exposures together to better understand why certain populations are at increased risk for developing Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.",Investigating the Neurodevelopmental Effects of Pyrethroid Pesticide and Stress Exposure On the Dopamine System in Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder,9989615,F30ES029018,"['Adult ', '

"Longevity and Stress in African American Families Project Summary/Abstract  The goal of this application is to identify patterns of perceived stress, active coping style, health status and genes that contribute to longevity observed within African American families. We will examine these factors using vertical and horizontal approaches by studying similarities between siblings and parent-child pairs. To this end, we have the following questions:  1) Do familial effects (genes and shared environments) create similarity in the patterns of perceived tress and coping within and across generations?  2) Does stress account for differences in patterns of longevity between families?  3) Do psychosocial factors like stress, coping, and discrimination account for differences in patterns of health status and longevity between families?  4) What role do genes play in patterns of stress and longevity?  5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? To address these research questions, we have planned five specific aims: 1) Collect data from 750 older African Americans on perceptions of stress, discrimination, coping style, health, personality and genetics from multi-generation families (parent-child and siblings). 2) Examine similarities and differences in stress and coping, and health status among sibling pairs and across generations within families. 3) Compare the health status of siblings concordant for higher stress and poorer coping to those with lower stress and better coping. 4) Examine genes associated with stress and longevity in comparisons of long lived families and short lived families and among sibling pairs. 5) Are there gene-environment interactions between genes associated with stress and longevity and environmental factors such as family financial adversity and discrimination? This project is novel and innovative in that it will employ a multi method approach to understand longevity. It will use a quantitative genetic approach, a molecular genetic approach, and a multi generation approach. To our knowledge, this is the first time all of these methods have been employed on one sample. Relevance/Project Narrative This project will significantly contribute to our understanding the biobehavioral complex of factors that leads to healthy aging by examining genetic and environmental factors related to stress. ",Longevity and Stress in African American Families,9977070,R01AG054363,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Family ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Parents ', ' Perception ', ' Personality ', ' Play ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Siblings ', ' Stress ', ' survivorship ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Generations ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Molecular Genetics ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Survivors ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Genetic ', ' Genetic Predisposition ', ' Genetic Susceptibility ', ' Inherited Predisposition ', ' Inherited Susceptibility ', ' genetic etiology ', ' genetic mechanism of disease ', ' genetic vulnerability ', ' genetically predisposed ', ' Genetic Predisposition to Disease ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' novel ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Quantitative Genetics ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Behavioral ', ' National Institute of Aging ', ' National Institute on Aging ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' longevity gene ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Heritability ', ' healthy aging ', ' effective intervention ', ' genetic strategy ', ' genetic approach ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' perceived stress ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' social disadvantage ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIA,WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,76933,0.14043991092693303
"Culturally Responsive Stress Reduction: A Mobile Mindfulness Application toSupport Health Promotion for African Americans ABSTRACT  The proposed intervention, Culturally Responsible Stress Reduction: A Mobile Mindfulness Application to Support Health Promotion for African Americans (CRSR), is designed to encourage the use of mindfulness to mitigate the disproportionate amount of stress-related health disparities facing African Americans. Current mindfulness approaches have been unsuccessful in engaging this population. This proposal aims to bridge this disparity by developing an mHealth (mobile health) mindfulness application (“app”) tailored specifically to the cultural values of the African American community.  Mindfulness involves meditative practices that cultivate purposeful and nonjudgmental attention to current thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations in the body. Mindfulness has been incorporated into widely-used interventions, including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The CRSR app will be grounded in ACT and will integrate the convenience of mobile technology with tailored content to allow users to shift from potentially harmful culturally prescribed stress-coping activities (e.g., self-reliance, emotional suppression) to adaptive mindfulness-based stress-coping activities aligned with culturally specific values. This integration of content, backed by theory and empirical evidence, effective instructional delivery, an interdisciplinary development team, and modern communication technology will produce an effective mHealth intervention.  The CRSR app features include guided meditations to connect the user to the present moment and a place of calm through culturally aligned exercises grounded in spirituality, orality, self-empowerment, and resilience; personalized notifications prompting users to reflect and engage with the app; periodic email messages on the importance mindfulness as a way increase control over physical and psychological health; and user- customized reminders.  Phase I included developing a testable prototype of the CRSR app, called Mindful You. The prototype provided functionality for participants to practice mindfulness and was used to test proof of concept, i.e., the feasibility and social acceptability of the CRSR app. Users experienced significantly decreased stress and increased self-efficacy. They also reported increased use of mindfulness behaviors and improved self- regulation. Phase II will iteratively build on the prototype to develop the final product and test its efficacy with a fully-powered randomized controlled trial. The final product will consist of a native mobile application on Android and Apple iOS.  The applicant, Trifoia, has assembled a knowledgeable and experienced team of research scientists, content and technology developers, and evaluation specialists to adequately realize this project. The company has an established track record of developing and marketing technology-assisted public health interventions. NARRATIVE  The proposed project will finalize and test a mHealth (mobile health) mindfulness application, Mindful You, tailored specifically to the cultural values of the African American community. Current mindfulness approaches to stress management have been unsuccessful in engaging this population. Mindful You actively leads users through mindfulness exercises to diffuse tension and decrease stress, aiming to reduce the disproportionate burden of stress-related health disparities among African

"SES-Related Disparities in Early Language Development and Child Risk for Developmental Language Disorder Project Summary/Abstract The goal of this study is to identify early risk for developmental language disorder (DLD) among young, low- income children, and to determine how caregiver and child chronic stress and interaction quality interact to disrupt language growth among these vulnerable children. The study is designed to address disparities in the rate of DLD among young children, with low-income children disproportionately affected (Norbury et al., 2017). The long-term objective is to identify pathways through which early family contexts and the conditions of poverty disrupt early language trajectories among low-income children and contribute to heightened rates of DLD. The proposed longitudinal study addresses three specific aims regarding low-income dyads: (1) to identify whether and to what extent caregiver stress affects their young children’s language trajectories and DLD status at 54 months; (2) to identify the extent to which children’s physiological stress contributes to their early language trajectories and DLD status at 54 months, and determine whether it is a key mediator of caregiver stress on these outcomes; and (3) to determine the interplay among caregiver stress, child stress, and caregiver-child interactions for their effects on children’s early language trajectories and DLD status at 54 months. Study procedures involve ascertainment of 320 low-income mothers and their 6- to 11-month-old children using medical records from a large urban hospital; eligible dyads will reside in households at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Measurements are collected thrice annually (one study visit, two in vivo observations) to comprehensively map family processes and experiences, caregiver-child interaction quality, caregiver stress and stress physiology, child stress physiology, and children’s linguistic trajectories until 54 months. The initial two study aims are addressed using multi-level growth models, with caregiver and child stress, respectively, as time-varying predictors. The third study aim uses multilevel path analyses to examine the interplay among child and caregiver stress, caregiver-child interactions, and children’s language trajectories and DLD status at 54 months. Project Narrative Developmental language disorder (DLD) is the most common developmental disability affecting young children, and has serious consequences for young children's overall development and educational achievement and for later socioeconomic and health disparities. The goal of this study is to identify early risk for developmental language disorder among young, low-income children, and to determine how caregiver and child chronic stress and interaction quality interact to affect language development among these vulnerable children.",SES-Related Disparities in Early Language Development and Child Risk for Developmental Language Disorder,9995455,R01DC018009,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Attention ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Developmental Disabilities ', ' Child Development Disorders ', ' Child Language ', ' Economics ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Exhibits ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Urban Hospitals ', ' City Hospitals ', ' Metropolitan Hospitals ', ' Household ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Language Development Disorders ', ' Developmental Disorder Speech or Language ', ' Developmental Language Disorders ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mothers ', ' Parent-Child Relations ', ' Parent-Child Relationship ', ' parent child interaction ', ' parent offspring interaction ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Visit ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Modeling ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' care giver stress ', ' caregiver stress ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Population-based research ', ' Population-level research ', ' Population Research ', ' in vivo ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Family Process ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Biosocial ', ' Impairment ', ' federal poverty level ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NIDCD,OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,611415,0.0870004377158048
"Effects of Social Networks and Policy Context on Health among Older Sexual and Gender Minorities in the US South ABSTRACT Older sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations experience significant disparities in morbidity and disability compared with their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. There are two primary explanations as to why physical health, mental health, and disability outcomes may differ for older SGM adults compared to older heterosexual and cisgender adults: 1) experiences of minority stress that negatively affect health over the life course, and 2) differences in the kind and quality of social networks and support in older age. In this study we develop and test a new conceptual model that integrates these two disparate areas of research by applying a multilevel approach to understanding how minority stress processes work. We contend that social networks mediate the relationship between minority stress and health. Social network effects may be negative, exacerbating the effects of negative life experiences of discrimination or violence by reinforcing feelings of negative marginality relative to dominant societal values and structures. Alternatively, social networks may buffer the effects of negative life experiences among SGM adults whose networks include more positive valuations of SGM identities. To test this model, we will collect in-depth ego-centric network data over three waves from 800 SGM adults aged 50 to 70 years and residing in the metropolitan statistical areas of three midsize cities in the US South: Nashville, TN; Birmingham, AL; and Raleigh, NC. Participants will be recruited using multiple face-to-face, community and targeted online methods in order to ensure inclusion of more isolated individuals or individuals who are less involved with community organizations. Surveys will be administered using a web-based instrument developed specifically for assessing multidimensional aspects of personal networks, physical and mental health, and experiences of minority stress. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project is important for public health because sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations experience substantial disparities in morbidity, mental health, and physical disability as they age. In this longitudinal panel study of minority stress, social networks, and health among older SGM adults in the United States, it will be possible to see how a person's social networks--and the attendant support they provide--shape individuals' responses to negative life experiences, including discrimination, harassment, and violence, and the effects of these life experiences on physical and mental health, morbidity, and disability. Understanding how networks and social support may mediate the effects of negative life events on health will have important policy and prevention implications for reducing health disparities by sexual orientation and gender identity, especially as the SGM population in the United States ages.",Effects of Social Networks and Policy Context on Health among Older Sexual and Gender Minorities in the US South,10017151,R01AG063771,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Buffers ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Ego ', ' Family ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Policies ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' community organizations ', ' public health relevance ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' support network ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' data access ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' Service provision ', ' protective factors ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,431589,0.014480420649059399
"Psychosocial stress, epigenetics and health disparity in hypertension ABSTRACT Essential hypertension (EH) remains a significant health problem with striking racial disparity. Compared with European Americans (EAs), African Americans (AAs) not only have a greater prevalence of EH but also are specifically prone to the negative effects of EH. Growing evidence indicated that cumulative exposure to psychosocial stress plays an important role in the development of EH. Racial differences in these social determinants of EH are likely to contribute to the racial differences in EH. However, little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms linking psychosocial stress to early etiology of EH. We hypothesize that exposure to chronic psychosocial stress adversely affect BP response to acute stress both in laboratory setting and real life via DNA methylation, impacting the progression of preclinical measurement of EH in early adulthood and culminating in EH. The fundamental objective of this proposal is to identify these DNA methylation changes and evaluate whether their roles differ between AAs and EAs. Building on our longitudinal Georgia Cardiovascular (CV) Twin Study in which a multi-ethnic twin sample of 750 twins (375 twin pairs) having at least one visit before age 18 and one visit from age 18-26 with blood samples available at this visit, we will conduct one additional follow-up visit (age range 30-42 years). The longitudinal twin study provides a powerful design to control both the genetic sources and plastic nature of DNA methylation. The specific aims are: (1) To examine the joint and distinctive impacts of psychosocial stress on DNA methylation changes in early adulthood. Genome wide DNA methylation and psychosocial stress exposure will be obtained at age 18- 26 and age 30-42. The CpG sites with their DNA methylation levels associated with stress exposure and showing changes with changes in exposure will be validated in our Georgia Stress and Heart cohort. Real-time PCR will also be conducted on genes within ±100kb of these CpG sites to check whether DNA methylation affects gene expression; (2) To identify the CpG sites with their DNA methylation levels mediating the effect of psychosocial factors on BP response to laboratory and real-life stress and preclinical measurements of EH (pulse wave velocity and left ventricular mass); and (3) To test whether the relationship identified in aim 1 and 2 are dependent on ethnicity and whether psychosocial stress related DNA methylation changes can potentially explain the health disparity between AAs and EAs in the development of EH. Understanding the underlying biological and molecular mechanisms through which the psychological stress becomes “biologically embedded” will have the potential to provide new treatment target and lead to effective prevention and treatment strategies to reduce EH risks in both AAs and communities.

"Social adversities, epigenetics, and the obesity epidemic Project Summary. This application is being submitted in response to PAR-16-355, Social Epigenomics Research Focused on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R01), and the overarching long-term goal of this research effort is to learn how to positively influence health trajectories, modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for obesity in youth. Obesity was selected as the primary health outcome as it is a health measure with widening racial/ethnic disparities over the past three decades, and it is a potent predictor of a host of negative social, educational, vocational, and health outcomes later in life. In this study we propose to leverage two ongoing prenatal cohorts in Florida and North Carolina, and recruit a sample of 470 pregnant women and follow their children to 24 months of age. The sample will be enriched for adversity in pregnancy and approximately evenly divided among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic subjects. We will assess the impact of mothers' prenatal stress on measures of DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which are homogenous in terms of cellular composition, and widely accepted as an optimal choice for examining in utero responses to stressors. In the epigenetic analyses we will use both targeted and big data approaches, using pyrosequencing to measure methylation of 31 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate ~90 known imprinted genes, and the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC (850k) bead chip for whole epigenome analyses. We will also assess maternal and child postnatal psychosocial stress exposure, and child growth in the first 24 months of life. Children who are overweight at any point during the first two years of life have an approximately six-fold increased risk for obesity at five years of age, and risk for chronic health problems across the lifecycle. The primary hypotheses of this study build on preliminary work from our group and include: 1) Maternal prenatal stress will be associated with increased DMRs regulating the expression of imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) DMR, increased methylation in Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CAMK4) gene, and methylation changes in novel CpG sites identified in the 850K analyses; 2) DNA methylation profile changes associated with prenatal stress will be related to alterations in gene expression; and 3) Methylation markers identified in Aim 1 will predict growth trajectories and measures of obesity at 24 months of age. Secondary analyses will examine several moderating factors, including: maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), maternal social supports, maternal postnatal psychosocial distress, postnatal offspring ACE, genetic variants, and relevant confounding variables. The mediating role of inflammatory markers will also be explored, and saliva DNA specimens will be collected on the full cohort at 24-months and 50 children at birth, allowing for tests of comparability of DNA methylation between HUVECs and saliva, and the stability of markers over time. Project Narrative. Chronic exposure to psychosocial stress often accompanies the experience of poverty and racial/ethnic minority status, and may be causally related to health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for negative health outcomes to learn how to best modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce

"Brain Health and Ethnic Disparities in ADRD Risk: The Case of Arab Americans - Covid Supplement Project Abstract This application for an NIA Administrative Supplement proposes to expand Alzheimer's Disease Risk and Ethnic Factors: The Case of Arab Americans (R01AG057510) to incorporate an assessment of COVID-19 stress as an area of investigation through an immediate, brief telephone interview. The parent study is the first of its kind to focus on AD health disparities in Arab Americans aged 65 and over living in the metro-Detroit area, home to the largest and most visible Arab American community in the US. Building on the original study, the planned supplement leverages an existing longitudinal study of Blacks and Whites from the same geographic area. Capitalizing on the bilingual data collection instruments prepared and finalized for the parent now delayed face-to-face study, we will conduct telephone interviews to address the following aims: 1) Characterize prevalence of COVID-19 stress types and cognitive health in metro-Detroit among three racial/ethnic groups; 2) Identify aspects of social relations that buffer links between COVID-19 stress and cognitive health; and 3) Determine the role of pre-existing social resources on COVID-19 stress and cognitive health. This project will document the prevalence of pandemic stress and its link to cognitive health among these vulnerable older adults in three prominent racial/ethnic groups in Michigan. Further, the telephone mode of the proposed data collection will provide a methodological opportunity to compare modes of cognitive health data collection between the newly proposed and parent study (delayed due to COVID-19) among diverse racial/ethnic groups. Establishing reactions to COVID-19 and examining links to cognitive health provides an innovative, cost effective opportunity to more fully identify health disparities. Understanding the contribution of social relations will refine theory about stress and cognitive health, provide key information to better prepare for future pandemics and develop intervention strategies for eradication of cognitive health disparities. Project Narrative This project will document the prevalence of pandemic stress and its link to cognitive health among older Arab Americans, Blacks and Whites in Michigan. Further, it will show if, how and why social relations modify the effects of pandemic stress on cognitive health for all groups and if there are racial and ethnic differences in these sources of support and stress.

"Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mental health problems are proportionately affect racial and ethnic minority populations, as well as populations that face chronic economic hardship (Evans, Wolf & Adler, 2012). There is clear evidence that (1) the processes that lay the groundwork for mental health disparities is laid during childhood (e.g., Chen & Miller, 2012) and (2) that damage to and dysregulation of the physiologic stress response is a powerful mechanism of the effects of chronic stress such as that associated with poverty on psychopathology (e.g., Evans & Kim, 2012). To contribute solutions to mental health disparities, we need interventions capable of affecting the systems that confer the risk. Since the psychobiologic stress response system (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axis; HPA) is a central mechanism linking health disparities to chronic stress, the stress response is a critical system to target. Improving children's ability to cope with stress and regulate their reactivity ha the potential to break the cycle of damage, especially if the coping strategies and regulatory processes that we target have effects at the physiologic level. Preliminary evidence from the PIs research lab has emerged showing that different types of coping are evident at the level of the HPA-it is, therefore, time to evaluate whether a coping intervention designed for children facing chronic stress will both (a) improve children's ability to use primary and secondary control coping, and (b) have sustained effects at the physiologic level. We have developed just such an intervention, which builds on these exciting new findings and is designed to address core underlying mechanisms of risk and repair in the highly stressful context of poor, urban youths' lives.  Preadolescence is a crucial time during which children's ability to recognize stress and it causes matures, and repertoires for coping with stress grow in both size and complexity. In addition, preadolescence is a time of increased brain changes and growth in key self-regulatory organs and systems. Preadolescents are, therefore, at a ripe stage to benefit from coping-based prevention and the plasticity of this developmental period suggests that such changes have the potential to be long-lasting. Our new prevention program is designed to prevent the onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms in preadolescent children facing chronic stress. Two mechanisms of action are targeted in this project. First, the project seeks to demonstrate that children facing chronic stress stemming from poverty, discrimination, and violence exposure can acquire and utilize new ways of coping that are adaptive in a wide variety of circumstances. Second, the project will examine the extent to which improved coping resulting from the intervention engages the physiologic intermediate mechanism of the HPA. Finally, the project aims to link changes in coping and the HPA to changes in internalizing symptoms that would signal prevention of the emergence of new or worsening of existing symptoms. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system that leads to psychopathology can offer new directions for combatting health disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial and socioeconomic disparities in physical and mental health problems are large, persistent, and severe; begin during childhood; and stem from in part damage to physiologic stress response systems caused by chronic stress. Discovery of ways to prevent and/or halt this progression of damage to a child's stress response system may offer new directions for combatting health disparities. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a new prevention program designed to teach preadolescent children effective ways for coping with chronic stress that will have direct effects on their physiologic stress response systems (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) and ultimately prevent onset of anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress symptoms and disorders.",Preventing Internalizing Psychopathology in Preadolescents Exposed to Chronic Stress,9893921,R33MH107631,"['Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Poverty ', ' Problem Solving ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Signaling ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Stress ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Critical Paths ', ' Critical Pathways ', ' Wolves ', ' Exposure to ', ' Nature ', ' Life ', ' System ', ' emotional expression ', ' expression of emotion ', ' showing emotion ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' stressor ', ' HPA axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' pre-adolescent ', ' preteen ', ' preadolescence ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' Prevention program ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Prevention ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' distraction ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Chronic stress ', ' iatrogenic ', ' iatrogenically ', ' iatrogenicity ', ' Iatrogenesis ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Cognitive ', ' R21/R33 Mechanism ', ' R21/R33 Program ', ' Phased Innovation Awards ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' functional outcomes ', ' efficacy trial ', ' Outcome ', ' psychological outcomes ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' psychobiological ', ' psychobiologic ', ' stem ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' developmental plasticity ', ' intervention effect ', ' coping mechanism ', ' post-trauma stress ', ' posttrauma stress ', ' posttraumatic stress ', ' post-traumatic stress ', ' stress disorder ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' violence victimization ', ' racial minority ', ' psychological symptom ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' exposure to violence ', ' violence exposure ', ' post-traumatic stress symptoms ', ' posttraumatic stress symptoms ', ' posttraumatic symptoms ', ' post-traumatic symptoms ', ' ']",NIMH,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R33,2020,685822,0.18156684209296528
"Early reproductive aging: stress and uterine fibroid risk among black women Project Summary (Abstract): The racial disparity in uterine leiomyomata (fibroids) is profound among African American women (AAW) – with an earlier age of onset of 10-15 years, a significantly higher incidence, and greater rates of hysterectomy, a major surgical procedure compared to Caucasian women (CW). The impact of fibroids is significant for reproductive age women, especially AAW who experience more symptomatology such as excessive bleeding, pain, and reproductive problems, and research on the risk factors for the condition is important. Earlier onset of fibroids among AAW may explain their larger size of fibroids and more symptomatology. Our central hypothesis is that the disproportionate burden of fibroids and the surgical disparities associated with the high fibroid morbidity result, at least in part, from the unique stress AAW experience. Specifically, racist societal and structural pressures that AAW experience may influence how AAW cope with stress, including their access to resources needed to mitigate such stress. Data from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences's Study of Environment, Lifestyle & Fibroids (SELF), the first prospective study of 1693 young AAW ages 23-34 years with fibroids assessed using standardized ultrasound examinations, will be analyzed. We will evaluate the hypothesis by pursuing three specific aims: 1) Examine the association between each baseline stress measure (i.e. life events, racial discrimination, daily stress, perceived stress, medical financial strain, and financial strain) and 5-year cumulative fibroid incidence and growth; 2) Create, describe, and explore 5-year trajectories of daily stress, perceived stress, medical financial strain, and financial strain and the life course trauma trajectories on 5-year cumulative incidence and growth of fibroids; and 3) Investigate the potential modifying effects of social support, spirituality/religiosity, socioeconomic status, coping, and early life conditions such as food insecurity, low financial status, etc., on the associations between stress and 5-year cumulative fibroid incidence and growth in Aims 1 and 2. This proposed ancillary research study will be the first study to bring fibroid incidence and growth data for more than 300 women and a range of stress measures including psychosocial resources and coping data and stress variables together to comprehensively investigate the stress experience in relation to fibroids in young AAW. Fibroids pose a major public health concern with the total associated cost (medical, work-related, etc.) estimated to be up to $34.4 billion annually. Determining risk factors for fibroids, such as stress which is modifiable, will advance our understanding of stress as a risk factor for fibroids and provide key information for improving the quality of life for African American women, who are more likely to experience missed days from work and disruption in physical activities and social relationships. It will also provide a strong research foundation that sheds light on potential intervention targets to reduce morbidity and surgical disparities; set the stage for identifying biological mechanisms for prevention; and elucidate the context of stress on fibroid risk. Project Narrative Uterine fibroids are common and affect 1 in every 4 to 5 women during their reproductive life and carry an annual estimated financial burden nearing $34.4 billion.

"Development of a Community Health Worker-Led Stress Reduction Intervention for Low-Income COPD Patients PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to provide Trisha Parekh, D.O., with the career development and research experience necessary to allow her to become an independent researcher in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) health disparities, with expertise in social care integration and psychological stress reduction in low-income communities using community health worker interventions. Disadvantages of social determinants of health, such as low socioeconomic status, are associated with adverse outcomes in COPD, including more frequent hospitalizations, early readmissions, and increased mortality. A majority of interventions to reduce readmission focus on addressing medical determinants of health, with a notable absence of addressing social needs that impede better health outcomes. The psychological stress associated with poverty and other disadvantages of social determinants of health can lead to negative downstream behavioral, psychological, and physiological effects. For COPD patients, these stress responses may include increased tobacco use, increased risk of anxiety or depression, or increased systemic inflammation, all of which are risk factors for acute exacerbations of COPD. Substantial knowledge gaps on the social determinants of health, their associated levels of perceived stress in COPD, and clinical outcomes associated with high levels stress in marginalized groups must be addressed in order to reduce health disparities and improve quality of life for these individuals. In this K23 proposal, under the guidance of an expert mentorship team, Dr. Parekh will conduct a mixed methods research study to inform the development of a targeted community health worker-led stress reduction intervention in low-income COPD patients that will focus on 1) addressing unmet social needs, 2) providing COPD disease education, and 3) promoting proactive coping behaviors. The specific aims for this research project are as follows: Aim 1: Identify modifiable social determinant of health predictors and clinical outcomes of perceived stress in COPD patients; Aim 2: Understand perceived stressful experiences in high-risk COPD patients; Aim 3: Develop and test the feasibility of a community health worker intervention to reduce stress in low-income COPD patients. At the completion of Aim 3, this intervention will be ready to be tested in a R-series grant funded randomized controlled pilot with the primary outcome of stress reduction and secondary outcomes of reduction in acute care use and tobacco use and improvement in quality of life. At the conclusion of this K23, Dr. Parekh will have the training and experience needed to transition to a successful independent investigator who has an expertise in COPD health disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE: The public health burden of COPD-related healthcare utilization is high, and low-income individuals contribute significantly with increased frequency of hospitalizations and early readmissions. Incorporating social care into healthcare delivery by addressing disadvantages of social determinants of health and associated stressors that are commonly experienced by low-income populations has become a priority for national agencies, including the Institute of Medicine and the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine. The project described in this career develop K23 application will use a mixed methods research design to develop and test a theory-driven community health worker-led stress reduction intervention that will focus on reducing psychological stress by addressing social determinants of health, providing COPD disease education, and promoting proactive coping behaviors.",Development of a Community Health Worker-Led Stress Reduction Intervention for Low-Income COPD Patients,10039875,K23HL153672,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Coping Behavior ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' health care delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Engineering ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Low Income Population ', ' Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease ', ' COPD ', ' Chronic Obstruction Pulmonary Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ', ' Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Reducing Maternal Stress to Improve Obesity-related Parenting Practices Project Summary Maternal stress is associated with children’s risk for obesity controlling for socioeconomic status, yet standard of care child obesity prevention programs have not focused on maternal stress reduction. The association between maternal stress and child obesity is particularly strong in Latino families, whose children also have the highest rates of obesity in the United States. A mindful parenting program might reduce Latina mothers’ psychological stress and lead to improved parenting practices and ability to create a healthier environment. The primary objective of the proposed research is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of an intervention that integrates mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindful parenting in a population whose children are at highest risk for obesity: Latina mothers. Phase 1 of the research involves developing and refining an integrative intervention manual, titled ATIENDE (Awareness Training to Influence Eating, Nutrition, Decision-making, and Exercise) and translating it into Spanish. Phase 2 involves conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing the ATIENDE intervention to an active control condition in 50 Latina mothers of elementary-school age children. Participant satisfaction rates and qualitative interviews will provide evidence of the program’s acceptability. Feasibility will be determined by examining recruitment rates, retention rates, and treatment fidelity. Completion of this project will inform the development of a full-scale efficacy trial. This Mentored Patient- Oriented Research Career Development Award builds upon the candidate’s experience and interest in conducting parent-focused obesity prevention research. The proposed research and training activities will provide the candidate with essential skills in the areas of: (1) intervention development; (2) trial design and conduct; and (3) advanced statistical methods. Training in these domains will prepare the candidate to be an independent investigator in the development and evaluation of parent mindfulness interventions to improve child obesity-related outcomes and reduce health disparities. Narrative Relevance to Public Health Obesity rates in the United States are among the highest in the world, leading to increased risk for illness and chronic disease. Maternal stress is associated with children’s increased risk for obesity, with the strongest association seen in Latino families, yet existing programming has failed to address this risk factor. The proposed research seeks to evaluate the feasibility of a mindful parenting intervention designed to reduce maternal stress and improve mothers’ eating and weight-related behaviors in families whose children are at highest risk for obesity.",Reducing Maternal Stress to Improve Obesity-related Parenting Practices,10039098,K23AT011049,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Nutrition ', ' pediatric nutrition ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Decision Making ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Manuals ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity -

"ER stress mediates methylglyoxal-evoked AIS shortening and neuronal dysfunction PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT (Diversity Supplement)  Alterations in the axon initial segment (AIS) are key pathophysiologies in various neurodegenerative diseases, including diabetes. Shortening of AIS length has been shown to lower neuronal excitability and is also implicated in cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer's disease. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of how these domains are altered in disease conditions remain poorly understood. This critical gap in knowledge limits the field's ability to manipulate the AIS for treatment. In order to fill this significant gap in our knowledge, the parent grant (R01 NS107398) tests the hypothesis that methylglyoxal (MG) disrupts AIS protein complexes via calpain activation and inhibits nervous system function. The current diversity supplement proposal seeks to elucidate more detailed mechanisms that lead to AIS shortening. The overall objective of this application is to identify a critical cellular mechanism that activates calpains in response to MG increase. The prior studies and preliminary data provided here have identified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress as a potential mediator for calpain activation and AIS shortening induced by MG increase. The hypothesis is that sublethal increase of MG induces ER stress, leading to calpain activation and AIS shortening. We will test this hypothesis via two Specific Aims. Aim 1: Test the hypothesis that, independent of MG increase, sublethal levels of ER stress cause calpain activation, AIS shortening, and neuronal network dysfunction. Aim 2: Test the hypothesis that inhibition of ER stress prevents MG-induced calpain activation, AIS shortening, and neuronal network dysfunction. This application is conceptually innovative, as we propose that ER stress is a key mediator of AIS shortening and neuronal dysfunction induced by MG. Innovative use of multi-electrode arrays will determine the effects of induced ER stress and increased MG together with ER stress inhibition on neural network function. The proposed research is significant, because completion of the aims will validate ER stress as potential targets for translational research aimed at treatments for comorbid cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes. These results also have potential to impact a wide variety of neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's. In addition to the scientific work, the important aspect of this diversity supplement is to support the career development of an African American female MD/PhD student. Her career goal is an independent physician scientist studying changes in neural transmission and cognitive defects caused by neurodegenerative diseases. Cognitive disorders disproportionately affect African Americans, yet African Americans are underrepresented in the scientific workforce. To address the inequity in heath research and clinics, it is critical to diversify the field. Thus, the proposed work and mentoring activities in this diversity supplement will ultimately provide a sustained and powerful influence on the field of neurodegenerative diseases. Project Narrative Disruption of the axon initial segment in neurons is associated with cognitive impairment in type 2 diabetes, in which the glucose metabolite methylglyoxal is elevated. This diversity supplement application together with the parent R01 grant will elucidate the mechanisms of how methylglyoxal affects axon initial segment and neuronal function by identifying a critical cellular mechanism involved in this process. The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to provide critical knowledge of nervous system pathophysiology needed to establishing novel treatments for cognitive impairment while training a future physician scientist to diversify the research field.",ER stress mediates methylglyoxal-evoked AIS shortening and neuronal dysfunction,10055833,R01NS107398,"['Action

"Increasing understanding of causes of stillbirth: Is the effect of maternal stress on stillbirth mediated by methylation of stress-related genes? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The burden of 2.6 million stillbirths a year places stillbirth on a par with neonatal mortality as a major global public health issue. In the U.S., the stillbirth rate of 6.0 per 1000 total births has consistently exceeded the infant mortality rate, and is higher than the stillbirth rates of 25 other high-income countries. Moreover, there is high racial inequity, with Black families facing a stillbirth rate more than double that of whites. There has been persistent global inattention to stillbirth prevention, and the United Nations’ goal of 12 stillbirths per 1000 births by 2030 is unlikely to be met. The CDC’s vital statistics report on mortality excludes stillbirths, and the CDC only began reporting on causes of stillbirth in 2014. One barrier is limited knowledge on causes. The wide range of stillbirth rates, from 1.3 in Iceland to 43.1 in Pakistan, demonstrates that most stillbirths are not inevitable, yet one-third of stillbirths are unexplained. A recent review of 489,089 stillbirths found a pooled estimate of 32% of stillbirths “unexplained” in high-income countries—nearly 400 times higher than the rate of unexplained infant deaths in the U.S. Limited understanding of causes reduces opportunities for prevention. Stress holds promise as a possible cause, with epidemiological evidence of an association with stillbirth, but no studies have yet assessed biological plausibility. One potential mechanism is epigenetic silencing of stress-related genes through DNA methylation. Using a nested case-control design with data from a racially diverse population-based cohort, the NICHD-founded Stillbirth Collaborative Research Network (SCRN), this study will assess whether the effect of maternal stress on stillbirth is mediated by methylation of stress-related genes. Study aims are to: (1) test models for the effect of stress (as measured by socioeconomic status, childhood maltreatment, and significant life events) on stillbirth in the SCRN population (663 stillbirths, 1,439 live births) and a subgroup of 66 non-anomalous full-term stillbirths and 132 livebirths; (2) use causal mediation analysis to assess evidence for mediation by methylation of stress-related candidate genes in placental tissue; (3) carry out exploratory assessment of modification of these effects by race/ethnicity; and (4) use an agnostic approach to further assess mediation by epigenome-wide methylation. By demonstrating biological plausibility, the study could contribute to knowledge of preventable causes, highlight the role of stress in inequity in stillbirth rates, generate new hypotheses, and inform the development of interventions at individual and policy levels to reduce stillbirth numbers. The proposed aims will directly contribute to the NICHD’s goals of improving pregnancy outcomes and identifying exposures to explain fetal loss, as well as the high-priority research area of addressing the burden of stillbirth. The proposed training plan will be delivered within Columbia University, one of the world’s preeminent research universities, providing the applicant with skills in epigenetics, bioinformatics, and advanced methods that will, with an outstanding sponsor team, ensure successful completion of the study and the applicant’s transition to a career as an independent researcher focused on stillbirth prevention. PROJECT NARRATIVE Stillbirth is a major public health burden in the U.S., with a rate of 6.0 per 1000 total births that has consistently exceeded the infant mortality rate (4.0 per 1000 live births), and rates among non-Hispanic Black families that are more than double that of whites—yet 30% of stillbirths are unexplained (due to an unknown cause). Maternal stress holds promise as a possible cause, but biological plausibility has not yet been assessed. This study will test whether the effect of maternal stress on stillbirth is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms, thereby contributing to knowledge of preventable causes of stillbirth, highlighting the role of stress in inequity in stillbirth rates, generating new hypotheses, and informing the development of interventions to reduce stillbirth numbers.",Increasing understanding of causes of stillbirth: Is the effect of maternal stress on stillbirth mediated by methylation of stress-related genes?,10067819,F31HD103336,"['Attention ', ' Bereavement ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Europe ', ' Family ', ' Fetal Death ', ' fetus death ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Iceland ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Inflammation ', ' Methods ', ' Methylation ', ' mortality ', ' Mothers ', ' Neonatal Mortality ', ' neonatal mortalities ', ' newborn death ', ' newborn mortality ', ' Pakistan ', ' Poverty ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy Outcome ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Training Support ', ' Unemployment ', ' jobless ', ' joblessness ', ' out of work ', ' unemployed ', ' United Nations ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Vital Statistics ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' Prematurely delivering ', ' Preterm Birth ', ' premature childbirth ', ' premature delivery ', ' preterm delivery ', ' Premature Birth ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Maternal Exposure ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Priority ', ' DNA Methylation ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' inattentiveness ', ' inattention ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' Live Birth ', ' fetal ', ' death in first year of life ', ' infant demise ', ' infantile death ', ' infant death ', ' stillborn ', ' stillbirth ', ' age group ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' skills ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' stressed mothers ', ' maternal stress ', ' Modeling ', ' International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ', ' International Classification of Diseases ', ' exposed in utero ', ' fetal exposure ', ' in utero exposure ', ' intra-uterine environmental exposure ', ' intrauterine environmental exposure ', ' prenatally exposed ', ' prenatal exposure ', ' case control ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Candidate Gene ', ' Candidate Disease Gene ', ' NR3C1 ', ' NR3C1 gene ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Subgroup ', ' Childhood maltreatment ', ' child maltreatment ', ' Child Abuse and Neglect ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Modification ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' systematic review ', ' virtual ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' Impairment ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' population based ', ' epigenome ', ' perinatal outcomes ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' adverse pregnancy outcome ', ' adverse childhood experiences ', ' adverse childhood events ', ' fetus loss ', ' fetal loss ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,F31,2020,41640,0.05136287772017776
"Improving Health Outcomes in African Americans with Type 2 Diabetes: A Culturally Tailored, Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management Education (RB-DSME) Intervention Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) costs the U.S. $327 billion annually, representing a 26% increase from 2012 to 2017. African Americans (AAs) are twice as likely to have T2DM as non-Hispanic Whites, have worse health outcomes, and are less likely to engage in self-management behaviors. Interventions addressing these disparities are urgently needed. Among AAs, T2DM-associated stress is often compounded by general life stress, which further constrains diabetes self-management and is associated with poor glucose control (A1C) and complications such as depression. The impact of stress on diabetes self-management and health outcomes may be attenuated by resilience: a resolve to succeed despite adversities. Even with evidence supporting resilience resources benefiting other health outcomes, there is a dearth of evidence-based T2DM resilience interventions. Building on our promising pilot work, the proposed study uses our culturally tailored, theory-derived Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management Education (RB-DSME) intervention to help participants manage the psychosocial and behavioral demands of the disease. We propose a 24-month, 2-arm, cluster RCT assigning churches to the RB-DSME or standard DSME condition. Both groups will receive a 10-month intervention: 8 weekly educational sessions, followed by 8 bimonthly support group sessions, followed by 2 booster sessions. To investigate the efficacy of RB-DSME, we will compare RB-DSME to DSME on T2DM physical (A1C, FBG, lipids, BMI, waist circumference, blood pressure) and mental (depressive symptoms, diabetes distress, general stress) health outcomes. To inform more targeted future interventions, we will examine indirect effects of RB- DSME (vs DSME) on resilience resources (adaptation to stress, finding positive meaning, adaptive coping, coping with discrimination, spiritual coping, self-efficacy, social support, emotional regulation). We will also examine indirect effects of resilience resources on T2DM health outcomes through self-management behaviors (dietary intake, physical activity, glucose self-monitoring, medication adherence). Emerging evidence—including our work linking hair cortisol with A1C in AAs—suggests that improved HPA axis function, a biological marker of stress, is associated with favorable T2DM health outcomes. Thus, we will also examine indirect effects of resilience resources on T2DM health outcomes via HPA axis function (cortisol, DHEA). The Specific Aims are: 1) To compare T2DM physical (primary outcome: A1C) and mental (primary outcome: depressive symptoms) health outcomes in RB-DSME vs DSME at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months post-study entry; and 2) To test indirect effects of RB-DSME (vs DSME) on T2DM health outcomes via resilience resources, self-management behaviors, and HPA axis function. Our project will provide crucial guidance for addressing the T2DM burden among AAs by establishing the efficacy of our RB-DSME and identifying behavioral and biological mechanisms by which the program affects T2DM health outcomes. Our long-term goal is to enable AAs to effectively manage T2DM and thus avoid its serious consequences, via RB-DSME interventions in a range of community settings. African Americans are twice as likely to have type 2 diabetes as non-Hispanic Whites and are less likely to engage in effective diabetes self-management. There is a critical need for intensive lifestyle interventions that address the distress inherent in having the disease and the unique stressors faced by African Americans that may worsen diabetes-related health outcomes. Our program, Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management Education, integrates resilience resources with diabetes self-management skills to enable African-American patients to manage the daily demands of the disease and improve long-term adherence to healthy lifestyle choices, thereby reducing the negative health burden of diabetes.","Improving Health Outcomes in African Americans with Type 2 Diabetes: A Culturally Tailored, Resilience-Based Diabetes Self-Management Education (RB-DSME) Intervention",10018879,R01DK123146,"['Affect ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Control Groups ', ' dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Androstenolone ', ' DHEA ', ' Dehydroisoandrosterone ', ' Prasterone ', ' Therapeutic Dehydroepiandrosterone ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Renal Disease ', ' kidney disorder ', ' renal disorder ', ' Lipids ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Retinal Diseases ', ' Retinal Disorder ', ' retina disease ', ' retina disorder ', ' retinopathy ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Support Groups ', ' Self-Help Groups ', ' self help organization ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Self Management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' waist circumference ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' Church ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' HPA axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' behavioral test ', ' behavior test ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Dietary intake ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cost ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' glucose control ', ' glucose homeostasis ', ' glucose regulation ', ' blood glucose regulation ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Impairment ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' high risk ', ' community setting ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' arm ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' stress symptom ', ' diabetes distress ', ' diabetes self-care ', ' diabetes self-management ', ' ']",NIDDK,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R01,2020,675472,0.04504413705179472
"Precarious Employment as a Determinant of Overweight and Cardiometabolic Risk PROJECT SUMMARY Reducing obesity disparities could greatly reduce health disparities by race/ethnicity for the leading cause of death in the U.S., cardiovascular disease (CVD). Therefore, it is critical to understand the systemic causes of disparities in obesity prevalence between racial/ethnic minority adults and children, compared to their white counterparts. “Precarious employment,” which is often characterized by low wages, limited fringe benefits, shorter tenure, and irregular hours, making employment risky and stressful for the worker, is disproportionately represented among racial/ethnic minorities. Precarious employment may increase body mass index through multiple mechanisms including, a biological stress response. Determining the extent to which precarious employment is a determinate of overweight and cardiometabolic risk is vitally important for mitigating disparities in chronic disease risk and informing structural approaches for improving population health in the U.S. The proposed work in this Pathway to Independence Award builds upon my current program of research investigating the role of employment status and conditions in overweight risk and enhances it by adding training in areas that are critical to accomplishing my career goal: establishing an independent research program that rigorously investigates the role of employment status and conditions as a determinate of racial and ethnic disparities in chronic disease risk. The training portion of this project includes coursework, guided readings, and career- building activities to gain skills in three areas: 1) causal inference methodologies; 2) the study of stress and CVD, and 3) racial/ethnic health disparities. The newly acquired skills and knowledge obtained during the training phase of this award will be applied in the research phase of the study. The research phase of the study aims to provide novel insights into the impacts of precarious employment on overweight and cardiometabolic risk, and to investigate the pathways of these relationships. We will leverage three unique datasets, two racially/ethnically diverse longitudinal cohorts with complementary employment and biological data (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth and National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health), and objective data on work activities and organization (Occupational Information Network Database), to accomplish the following specific aims: 1) determine the extent to which precarious employment affects overweight/obesity risk among adults and children in the U.S. and examine whether any association varies by race/ethnicity; 2) determine whether biological stress mediates the association between precarious employment and BMI and overweight/obesity risk among adults; 3) determine whether precarious employment is associated with cardiometabolic risk biomarkers among adults and examine whether any association varies by race/ethnicity; and 3a) determine whether overweight/obesity and biological stress mediate the association between precarious employment and cardiometabolic risk. Employment precariousness is modifiable through policy-level changes, making this a critical topic for study. PROJECT NARRATIVE Reducing obesity disparities could greatly reduce health disparities by race/ethnicity for the leading cause of death in the U.S., cardiovascular disease.

"Intergenerational health impacts of interpersonal and community-based violence: From childbirth to childbearing Project Summary  This proposal outlines a 3-year post-doctoral training fellowship, designed to prepare the trainee for a career as an independent researcher at a major research university. The research and training plan are based on the applicant's interest in studying social determinants of health and how violence and social stress are structured and embodied in ways that can perpetuate health inequities across generations. Her career before graduate school involved applied mixed method research and public policy advocacy for minority populations experiencing disenfranchisement and human rights violations in Southeast Asia. During her graduate training she gained advanced training in epidemiologic, demographic, and social research methods in order to study structural causes of population health disparities. For her dissertation, she designed and completed her own survey at the Thai-Myanmar border among refugees, migrants, and local residents in order to better evaluate how maternal and child health is shaped by maternal life histories related to armed conflict, racism, military and police surveillance, and other forms of violence. She recruited over 800 mother-child pairs, 520 of which completed each survey component: in depth mother interviews, anthropometry, and hair sample collections.  The post-doctoral research and training that she proposes uses data she has already collected, along with complementary datasets from Southeast Asia and the US, that allow her to examine more closely how violence can influence maternal and child health, through social chains of risk and related biological mechanisms. She will model maternal chains of risk triggered by violence and potentially leading to adverse birth outcomes, from childbirth to childbearing, as they are indicated in life event histories collected among conflict- and displacement-affected populations at the Thai-Myanmar border (Aim 1) and as they have been measured prospectively in a US-representative cohort at the peak of family formation (Aim 2). She will focus in more closely on maternal biological stress as a mediator of past violence and adverse birth outcomes by examining how childhood and adolescent violence shape adult biological markers of stress and chronic inflammation among mothers before and during pregnancy based on cohort data from the Philippines (Aim 3).  The proposed training plan involves the study of human biological and psychological models of stress and health physiology, along with practical training in the bioassays and analysis of stress biomarker data, in order to complete the proposed aims and prepare for an independent research career. Specific training goals include: (1) Deepen understanding of stress physiology and biosocial pathways of embodiment; (2) Broaden expertise with field-based longitudinal survey data collection and analysis; (3) Learn field-based stress data and biospecimen collection and related lab techniques and analyses; and (4) Establish publication record, prepare for faculty position, and write grants for future research. Narrative Violence affects at least 44% of women in the US, and more than one in three globally. The proposed research project is aimed at uncovering how burdens of violence experienced by women over the life course—from childbirth to childbearing—underlie long-term maternal stress and pregnancy health by getting “under the skin,” and potentially into the womb. Results from this project may improve our understanding of the biosocial pathways connecting violence and health over the life-course and intergenerationally, particularly among disproportionately affected populations, which may inform preventative policy and public health measures.",Intergenerational health impacts of interpersonal and community-based violence: From childbirth to

"Reducing Health Disparities among African American Women: A Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management Intervention PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The unjust social, economic, and environmental conditions that African Americans face throughout their lives lead to pervasive health disparities. These disparities are driven by healthcare differences, where White patients are more likely to receive medical procedures when they seek care, and it is of higher quality, than what is received by African Americans. They are driven by economic differences, where the net worth of non- Hispanic White households is $132,000 while it is only $9,000 for Black households. Those with less financial wealth have poorer health as compared to those with higher socioeconomic status. And yet, even when controlling for these two important social determinants of health, race still predicts morbidity and mortality.  What can account for this? Stress. African Americans experience more stress than their White peers. The story is even more dire for African American women who simultaneously face both racial discrimination and sexism. Indeed, gendered racial discrimination is nearly ubiquitous for Black women at all socioeconomic levels. It is also a distinct form of stress, with unique outcomes compared to other non-race-or-gender-related stressors. Finally, stress has clear downstream negative effects on health.  To our knowledge, there is no mobile cognitive–behavioral stress management intervention (m-CBSMi) on the market that is designed to help African American women manage racial and nonracial daily stress. We intend to fill this void. Using proven CBSMi techniques, Black women will learn how to manage their stress through text messages and integrated mobile web content. Supportive texts will inspire, motivate, and affirm the life experiences of African American women. Educational texts will increase knowledge, develop skills, and reduce barriers to adaptive coping. A library of individually tailored videos will be delivered to each user based on her personal experiences. All mobile web content will be accessible only through touch-based links embedded within text messages, making it easy and effortless to view this material.  In Phase I, a prototype m-CBSMi was developed. This development was informed by formative research with community-based care providers plus 24 African American women across the lifespan. The results of Phase I strongly support the feasibility and potential effectiveness of the intervention, far exceeding the benchmarks established in the Phase I proposal.  During Phase II we will complete development of the m-CBSMi for African American women. Then, in partnership with Family and Medical Counseling Service, we will examine the effectiveness of the m-CBSMi to reduce stress among African American women. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention condition or to a matched control condition. Secondary measures will assess coping, well-being, subjective health, gendered racial identity, and knowledge. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project aims to develop a stress management program for African American women to reduce stress caused by discrimination and non-discrimination experiences on mobile phones. Because most Black women have smartphones, this program can be easily distributed at a lower cost. For African American women, the skills contained in this program will help them reduce stress and the negative impact that stress has on health.",Reducing Health Disparities among African American Women: A Mobile Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management Intervention,10139443,R44MD014077,"['Computers ', ' Counseling ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Libraries ', ' Life Experience ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Ownership ', ' Patients ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Comprehension ', ' base ', ' Procedures ', ' Phase ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Link ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Individual ', ' uptake ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' Multimedium ', ' Multimedia ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Techniques ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' high school ', ' care seeking ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Touch ', ' tactile sensation ', ' Touch sensation ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' cost ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' community based care ', ' Affective ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' prototype ', ' effective intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' social health determinants ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' racial identity ', ' short message service ', ' texting ', ' Text Messaging ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NIMHD,"ISA ASSOCIATES, INC.",R44,2020,749632,0.1551294676305639
"THE HARMONY Study - A culturally-relevant, randomized-controlled, stress management intervention to reduce cardiometabolic risk in African American women. Project Summary/Abstract African American women (AAW) have higher rates of death and disability from chronic cardiometabolic (CM) illnesses compared to any other group of women in the US, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke. 80% of AAW are overweight or obese, and they are the largest US sociodemographic group with inadequate engagement in exercise. Nearly 50% of AAW have cardiovascular disease, and AAW have more than twice the rate of diabetes compared to White women. Compelling evidence shows that AAW are least successful at achieving and sustaining CM risk-reduction goals compared to men and women of other racial/ethnic groups, despite participating in comprehensive lifestyle interventions. These alarming disparities are due in part to disproportionately high rates of exposure to psychological stress. Culturally-relevant stressors in AAW are positively and significantly associated with perceived stress, depressive symptoms, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity in AAW – CM risk factors. A shortcoming of interventions with AAW is their inadequate focus on stress exposure, including gender and racialized stress, stress physiology and stress- related barriers to healthy eating and exercise known to reduce CM risk. To address this shortcoming, we propose a randomized controlled trial to test a culturally-tailored mindfulness-based stress management intervention. This RCT is designed to help AAW build on their strengths to promote stress management and improved CM health by enhancing positive reappraisal, self-regulation, and self-efficacy, all of which are cognitive-behavioral facilitators of self-management and positively impacted by mindfulness training. In this 2- arm CM-risk reduction RCT with 200 AAW ≥ 18 years old with CM risk, we will be powered to detect group differences in exercise and healthy eating behaviors Specific aims are: AIM 1: Test the hypothesis that AAW participating in an 8-session culturally-relevant mindfulness-based intervention to reduce CM risk have: AIM 1A (primary) greater sustained improvements in exercise and healthy eating behaviors and AIM 1B (secondary) greater reduction in CM risk biomarkers (BMI, % body fat, waist to hip ratio [WHR], BP, and inflammatory cytokines [High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein; hs-CRP])) at 4, 8, and 12 months, compared to AAW in an attention-control CM risk reduction intervention without mindfulness. AIM 2 (exploratory: Test the hypothesis that improvements in mindfulness, stress management, positive reappraisal, self-regulation, and self-efficacy mediate the effects of the intervention on exercise and healthy eating. We will work with a community health agency and a community advisory board to facilitate the implementation and success of our intervention. We address the NIH call to identify interventions that promote self-management to reduce disparities through a culturally-tailored, community-based mindfulness-based intervention for AAW that targets resilience in the face of culturally-relevant stressors. If effective, we will scale this contextually relevant mindfulness intervention based on AAW's strengths for broad use in community settings. Project Narrative The HARMONY study will test the effects of a culturally-tailored mindfulness self-management intervention on sustained improvements in healthy eating and exercise through improved mindful stress management, self- regulation, and self-efficacy in overweight African American women at risk for chronic cardiometabolic illness.","THE HARMONY Study - A culturally-relevant, randomized-controlled, stress management intervention to reduce cardiometabolic risk in African American women.",10049832,R01MD015388,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Eating ', ' Food Intake ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exercise ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Physiology ', ' Posture ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Self Care ', ' personal care ', ' Informal Social Control ', ' Self Regulation ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Weather ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' Risk Assessment ', ' Self Management ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' diet education ', ' nutrition education ', ' Chronic ', ' waist-to-hip ratio ', ' Waist-Hip Ratio ', ' Death Rate ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Body fat ', ' Life ', ' Adopted ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' self reliance ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Emotional ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' actigraph ', ' actigraphy ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostatic load ', ' care giving ', ' caregiving ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Eating Behavior ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' 18 years of age ', ' age 18 years ', ' eighteen year old ', ' eighteen years of age ', ' 18 year old ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' loved ones ', ' community setting ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' mindfulness ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' attentional control ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' mindfulness-based intervention ', ' mindfulness intervention ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' Mindfulness Approach ', ' Mindfulness Therapy ', ' Mindfulness Treatment ', ' Mindfulness-based Approach ', ' Mindfulness-based Therapy ', ' Mindfulness-based Training ', ' Mindfulness-based Treatment ', ' Mindfulness Training ', ' feasibility trial ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' perceived stress ', ' socio-demographic groups ', ' sociodemographic group ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,641906,0.11876027464926693
"Mindfulness-intervention to Address PTSD in Trauma-exposed, Homeless Women ABSTRACT Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public health concern that disproportionately effects minorities and those with low-socioeconomic status, such as homeless women, creating a critical health disparity. PTSD has been linked with dysregulated hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) functioning and increased inflammation, which can lead to long-term physical-health problems and PTSD-symptom maintenance, exacerbating disparities. Mindfulness-based interventions, including Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR), have shown promise as a complementary tool for addressing PTSD in veterans and with low-income, minority populations, but homeless women have not been examined adequately. MBSR may improve PTSD symptomatology and help modulate the dysregulated stress response common in individuals with PTSD, improving physical and mental health concurrently. This project proposes a mixed-methods, open-label, parallel, randomized-clinical trial of a modified-MBSR intervention to reduce PTSD symptoms in homeless women and to explore physiological correlates of treatment-response. Inclusion criteria will be currently homeless women, age 18-64, with clinically-significant PTSD as defined by standard guidelines. Phase I will be a qualitative study to refine MBSR for cultural-appropriateness in a high-minority community and to address the specific needs of homeless women. In Phase II, participants will be randomly assigned to the MBSR-based intervention or a health promotion attention-control group. At baseline, women will complete psychosocial assessments (e.g., depression, substance use, trauma history) and participate in a brief stress task, providing salivary samples before and after the task (which will be assayed for cortisol and C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation). Women will then participate in the 9-week MBSR-based program or health-promotion control group. Follow-up assessments that include psychosocial and biological data will occur immediately after final intervention session and again 6-months later. Clinically-meaningful improvements in PTSD (primary outcome) and secondary outcomes (e.g., depression, substance use, inflammation, cortisol reactivity) will then be examined. The candidate’s training plan capitalizes on the expertise of a diverse mentoring team, integrating advanced training in mixed-methods research, community-based clinical trials, mindfulness-based interventions, and salivary biosciences. The plan includes didactic courses and on-one-one mentoring at the University of California, Irvine (mixed-methods, qualitative design, clinical trials, and salivary bioscience) and Loma Linda University (MBIs), both in Southern California. The training plan also includes in-depth workshops in each substantive area and in training in the responsible conduct of research. The candidate will complete the K01 with expertise in mixed- methods, biopsychosocial approaches to address PTSD in populations with high health-disparities.

"Mechanisms Underlying Sexual Minority Health Disparities in the United States Project Summary/Abstract Families headed by sexual and gender minorities are a growing segment of the population, yet sexual and gender minority health disparities in areas including self-rated health, chronic conditions, health behaviors, and depression persist. Minority stress has been implicated as a key cause of health problems, and family functioning, emotion regulation, couple-level minority stress, and community contexts have been identified as potential mechanisms underlying these associations. Contemporary theoretical models have yet to be tested due to a lack of data, and further, this lack of data has made studies of the intersection of racial and ethnic minority stress with sexual and gender minority stress difficult. This project will produce the first population- representative, multi-method, fully-powered study of cohabiting and married sexual and gender minorities and their partners, and a comparison sample of cis-gender individuals in different-gender unions. Aim 1. Evaluate whether and how family functioning (e.g. relationship quality) mediates the negative effects of stress due to discrimination on physical and mental health and health behaviors. Aim 2. Using an experience sampling method embedded in a time-diary, examine 1) the mediating role of emotion regulation, and 2) dyadic stress processes in the association between stress and subsequent health behaviors and time-use among same- gender couples. Aim 3. Investigate the association between community-level factors including economic disadvantage, access to healthcare, and the sexual and gender minority political climate (i.e. state employment protections) and sexual and gender minorities’ physical and mental health and health behaviors. Aim 4. Determine race and ethnic health gaps among sexual [and gender] minorities and evaluate potential protective factors that may minimize these gaps. We will recruit 2690 US adults aged 18 to 60 who are cohabiting or married to same- and different-gender partners, along with their partners. The sample will include an oversample of respondents of color. Population-representative Gallup samples afford a unique and efficient opportunity to study sexual and gender minorities who are in unions via targeted sampling. Using a mobile phone application platform, we will also collect time-diary and experience sampling method data. The primary significance of this project is 1) the identification of family functioning and emotion regulation as mediators of sexual and gender minority stress due to stigma and discrimination and poor physical and psychological health and health behaviors, and 2) the collection of dyadic data that will elucidate dyadic minority stress processes. The proposed research is innovative because it is the first contemporary, population-representative study of sexual and gender minority health that includes family functioning, emotion regulation, and dyadic data and an oversample of racial and ethnic minorities. These data will help researchers better understand how to improve the health of sexual and gender minorities by illuminating potential mechanisms underlying health disparities. Data will be available to scholars across the world through ICPSR and the American Heritage Time Use Study. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because 1) the identification of family functioning and emotion regulation as mediators of sexual and gender minority stress due to stigma and discrimination and poor physical and psychological health and health behaviors, 2) the collection of dyadic data critical to testing dyadic minority stress processes, and 3) the examination of the intersection of sexual and gender minority stress and racial and ethnic minority stress, are ultimately expected to lead to new evidence-based interventions and policies designed to improve adult and child wellbeing across American family contexts. Overall, the primary positive impact will be evidence that will be applicable to clinical and community settings to set adults and children in the families of sexual and gender minorities on successful developmental trajectories. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to that part of the NICHD's mission that all Americans are able to develop to their full capability so that their lives, and intimate relationships, may be healthy, gratifying, and long.",Mechanisms Underlying Sexual Minority Health Disparities in the United States,10176833,R01HD094081,"['Sexual Health ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Collection ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' time use ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' community setting ', ' population based ', ' sexual minority ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' racial minority ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' data resource ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Welfare ', ' adolescent welfare ', ' child well being ', ' child wellbeing ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Color ', ' Communities ', ' Couples ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Employment ', ' Family ', ' Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Family Research ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Marriage ', ' Masks ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Stress ', ' Survey Methodology ', ' Survey Method ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Respondent ', ' diaries ', ' Complex ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' member ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Sampling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Mobile Phones ', ' Car Phone ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,402004,0.05133594186921245
"Neural Mechanisms of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Abstract. Our funded R61 is an RCT of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) vs a well-matched comparator and pre-post fMRI. We are testing the hypothesis that MBCT engages a novel therapeutic mechanism involving increased capacity for metacognitive emotion regulation (“decentering”), and this is underlain by increased functional connectivity (FC) between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). We hypothesized that MBCT-linked increases in decentering would reduce perservative negative thinking (PNT), a transdiagnostic process common to distress disorders. However, at present our entire planet is caught in the grip of a global COVID-19 pandemic, which has led to suspension of in-person research. Nearly half of US adults report negative mental health impact due to worry and stress over the virus, and disease and social burdens of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as stress from the resulting economic downturn are profoundly impacting mental health. The state of Michigan (>52K COVID-19 cases/>5K deaths) is among the most impacted “hot zones” in the US. Communities with high densities of low-income African Americans are the hardest hit and disproportionately bear the brunt of this pandemic. African Americans account for 32% of all Michigan COVID cases and 44% of all COVID-related deaths, yet are only 14% of the Michigan population. Wayne County, which includes the city of Detroit, is the single hardest hit location in Michigan, with >19K cases and >2K deaths. African Americans are also often exposed to everyday racial discrimination, a prevalent and pernicious form of psychological stress, and have higher rates of physical health disorders that amplify COVID risk. Childhood adversity, trauma exposures, and poverty, disproportionately elevated in African Americans, as well as PNT, likely also substantially increase risk for anxiety, depression, and SUD in the context of COVID-related stress. Mental health treatments are needed for COVID-impacted individuals, especially low income African Americans who are disproportionately impacted; however, social distancing measures and increased financial insecurity create additional barriers. To adequately serve these communities we now face an urgent need to test the feasibility and efficacy of already validated, remotely-delivered stress management programs in health disparity populations. Such remotely delivered interventions, including MBCT, are feasible and recent data suggest are highly efficient and efficacious for depression, anxiety, PTSD and SUD. Based on this evidence, we propose to conduct a RCT of remotely delivered MBCT (N=30) & PMR (N=30) in underserved, trauma-exposed health disparity populations disproportionately impacted by COVID in South East Michigan. We will test hypotheses about the efficacy of remotely-delivered stress management for COVID-related stress, anxiety and depression in this population, as well as hypotheses about the specific psychological mechanism of MBCT, involving increased decentering / metacognitive emotional regulation, and how this relates to improvement in PNT and related distress. Project Narrative: Mindfulness-based interventions like MBCT and MBSR may provide additional treatment options for acute hard-to-treat psychiatric conditions including treatment-resistant depression, GAD, and PTSD. However, the specific therapeutic mechanisms underlying MBCT/MBSR are not well understood, nor is it known whether these are shared with other therapies, or provide novel and potentially complimentary treatment components that can be used in combination. Elucidating MBCT mechanisms can enhance ongoing refinement and optimal targeting of psychotherapy interventions for PTSD and other acute psychiatric disorders.",Neural Mechanisms of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),10175462,R61AT009867,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Loneliness ', ' lonely ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Michigan ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Persons ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Parents ', ' Client satisfaction ', ' Patient Satisfaction ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Rewards ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' self esteem ', ' Social Distance ', ' Social isolation ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suspensions ', ' Suspension substance ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Virus Diseases ', ' Viral Diseases ', ' viral infection ', ' virus infection ', ' virus-induced disease ', ' Virus ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Planets ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Businesses ', ' shelter ', ' shelter-housing ', ' Shelter facility ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' Grips ', ' grasp ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' Country ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' stressor ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' coping ', ' mindfulness based cognitive therapy ', ' Population ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Trauma ', ' new drug treatments ', ' new drugs ', ' new therapeutics ', ' new therapy ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' novel drug treatments ', ' novel drugs ', ' novel therapy ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' loved ones ', ' efficacy testing ', ' virus transmission ', ' viral transmission ', ' Telemental ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' pediatric adversity ', ' childhood adversity ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' CoV emergence ', ' coronavirus emergence ', ' emergent CoV ', ' emergent coronavirus ', ' emerging CoV ', ' emerging coronavirus ', ' nCoV ', ' new CoV ', ' new coronavirus ', ' novel CoV ', ' novel coronavirus ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' COVID ', ' CoV disease ', ' corona virus disease ', ' coronavirus disease ', ' rate of infection ', ' infection rate ', ' ']",NCCIH,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R61,2020,70578,0.05794446499118172
"Projection-specific gene expression in resilience to chronic stress Project Summary Major depressive disorder (MDD) affects ~4% of the worldwide population, and these numbers are continuously increasing. Moreover, MDD disproportionately affects women, who are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with the disease. Thus, uncovering the molecular, cellular, and circuit-level mechanisms underlying susceptibility and resilience to depression is critical. Recent work demonstrates that ventral hippocampal (vHPC) projections to nucleus accumbens (NAc) regulate mood and susceptibility to stress. Our group has shown that the transcription factor ΔFosB is crucial for hippocampal cell morphology and learning, and several lines of evidence implicate hippocampal ΔFosB in depressive-like behaviors (e.g., FosB knockout mice have hippocampal malformations and depressive behaviors, and current antidepressants induce ΔFosB in vHPC). However, to date there is no study characterizing the role of hippocampal ΔFosB in stress resilience and depression. To this end, we have produced a novel dual-virus CRISPR-Cas9 system allowing knockout of FosB gene expression specifically in vHPC cells projecting to the NAc. In combination with our many well-vetted molecular, physiological, and behavioral tools and models, this will allow us to address the central hypothesis that ΔFosB expression in vHPC neurons projecting to NAc mediates cell function and resilience to social stress in male and female mice. To test this hypothesis, we propose two Specific Aims. In Aim I, we will first characterize the epigenetic mechanisms of induction of the FosB gene in hippocampus by chronic stress, determine its role in resilience to stress in both males and females, and uncover its transcriptional targets in vHPC. Indeed, our preliminary data show that inhibition of ΔFosB in vHPC induces susceptibility to depression-like symptoms. In Aim II, we will examine the stress induction and cellular effects of ΔFosB in vHPC neurons with projections to various brain regions, including NAc, then use our novel dual-virus system to knock down FosB gene expression specifically in vHPC cells projecting to the NAc and observe the behavioral results on stress responses. Here, too, we have strong preliminary data suggesting that ΔFosB regulates the excitability of vHPC neurons, and that ΔFosB expression in the vHPC- NAc projection cells regulates susceptibility to depression. Together, the proposed studies will elucidate the critical role of ΔFosB in stress-induced changes in hippocampal control of limbic circuitry of both males and females, as well as identify novel ΔFosB targets that could serve as potential points for sex-specific therapeutic intervention in depression or PTSD. Stressful and traumatic experiences can contribute to mood disorders in some individuals while others are resilient to this process, and though we know that the hippocampus plays a crucial role in stress responses, there is a critical gap in our knowledge of how changes in hippocampal gene expression may drive resilience to stress. The proposed work seeks to delineate the role of ΔFosB, a transcription factor induced by stress, in the changes in gene transcription and cell physiology of hippocampal neurons that project to specific brain targets to mediate resilience to stress. This work is relevant to NIMH’s high priority interest in research utilizing sex as a biological variable and investigating mental health disparities, and utilizes innovative techniques to uncover basic pathophysiology that may be exploited as novel therapeutic interventions in major depressive disorder or posttraumatic stress disorder.",Projection-specific gene expression in resilience to

"A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this study is to determine how different trajectories of minority stress experienced throughout adolescence may predict behavioral health outcomes for SMA. Relying on methods established and tested in our preliminary work, we will recruit a national sample of diverse SMA (e.g., race and ethnicity, gender, urban vs. rural; N = 1,500) through both social media and respondent-driven sampling strategies in the first year of the project. We will follow participants for three years, incorporating the fundamental tenets of developmental psychopathology, which suggest that examining risk and protective factors for adolescents necessitates longitudinal exploration across critical stages of development. Guiding the proposal are three specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the individual and group trajectories of minority stress over time by following a national sample of SMA (N = 1,500) for 3 years. WH1: There will be differences in minority stress across adolescent development. Aim 2: Determine whether trajectories of minority stress are associated with differences in behavioral health outcomes over time. WH2.1: Trajectories of minority stress and behavioral health outcomes will be associated over time. WH2.2: Reporting higher levels of minority stress in early adolescence will be associated with poorer behavioral health outcomes in later adolescence. Aim 3: Determine whether the association between minority stress and behavioral health over time is different based on sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., urbanicity, gender, race and ethnicity). WH3: There will be significant differences in outcome trajectories by demographic subgroup. WH4: Trajectories of minority stress will be inversely associated with protective factors over time and will differ by demographic subgroup. To test our hypotheses, we propose cutting-edge longitudinal quantitative methodology including latent growth-curve modeling, which are rarely used to examine longitudinal risk among SMAs. The proposed research will be the first to determine how minority stress may influence health across adolescence, and this information can be used directly to inform clinical assessment and the development of targeted behavioral health interventions for this high-need population. Project Narrative Sexual minority adolescents (SMA; adolescents who report a same-sex sexual orientation) are at much higher risk for behavioral health concerns than their heterosexual peers, yet little is known about how different patterns of gay-related stress over time impacts mental/behavioral health outcomes. The proposed research is to examine the individual and group trajectories of sexual minority adolescents (ages 14 to 17 at baseline) and examine how differences in these trajectories predict behavioral health outcomes. The resulting knowledge can be used to inform clinical assessment and the development of effective targeted behavioral health interventions to reduce the behavioral health disparities found in this high need population.",A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents,9936451,R01MD012252,"['Academy ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Marshal ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' life history ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' early adolescence ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' Same-sex ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,737684,0.07466901078672034
"Programmatic role of maternal preconception stress on offspring metabolic health Project Summary African-American women and their infants are twice as likely to experience pathologies or die up to one year postpartum than their Caucasian counterparts, even when controlling for income, access to care, and education. The underlying cause of this racial disparity is not well understood, but one contributing factor may be the perceived stress of racism (PSR). Racial discrimination evokes a physiological stress response and across the lifespan precipitates a state of chronic stress. Like chronic stress, PSR is associated with impaired responses to stress, premature aging pathologies, increased risk of chronic diseases, and increased cumulative “wear and tear” on body systems, or allostatic load. However, the mechanisms by which stress experience throughout a woman’s lifetime, including PSR, interacts with subsequent psychological or physiological challenges are unknown. As pregnancy is a time of incredible metabolic demands and increased placental oxidative and mitochondrial stress are key endophenotypes of gestational pathologies like gestational diabetes, increased allostatic load prior to pregnancy may contribute to gestational disorder risk. We have developed a novel mouse model of maternal preconception stress, where preconception stress programs maternal metabolic dysfunction, unmasked by the energetic demands of pregnancy, and alters maternal and fetal health outcomes. Exciting preliminary data implicates sex-specific epigenetic changes in the placenta in programming female offspring stress dysregulation. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the energetic demands of pregnancy unmask latent maternal metabolic dysfunction programmed by preconception stress, altering offspring development and maternal health involving sex-specific epigenetic reprogramming of the placenta. Under the guidance of the primary mentor, Dr. Bale, and mentoring committee, the outlined training plan will allow the PI to gain the necessary technical and didactic training in epigenetics, bioinformatics, and metabolism (1), to leverage this training to implement ‘omics technology and advance knowledge on the long-term programmatic effects of preconception stress (2), and enhance grantsmanship, scientific writing, and mentorship skills building towards the ultimate goal of becoming an independent Principal Investigator (3). All training will occur at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, a major research institution with a vast network of core services with state-of-the- art facilities and expertise to support biomedical research. Three Specific Aims will address this hypothesis by determining the role of preconception stress programming of the maternal milieu in altering offspring development (Aim 1), how placental OGT integrates metabolic signals from the maternal milieu to program fetal development (Aim 2), and the intergenerational consequences of preconception stress compounded by female offspring stress hypersensitivity (Aim 3). This research provides mechanistic insight into how metabolic disorder risk is compounded throughout a woman’s lifespan by preconception stress, including PSR, and has long-term maternal and offspring health consequences, a process that may contribute to the larger racial health disparity. Project Narrative The racial disparity in maternal and fetal health outcomes persists even when controlling for income, access to care, and education, leading to considerations of additional factors such as the state of chronic stress precipitated by the psychosocial stress of racism (PSR). We have developed a novel mouse model of maternal preconception stress, where preconception stress programs maternal metabolic dysfunction, unmasked by the energetic demands of pregnancy, and alters maternal and fetal health outcomes. As increased placental oxidative and mitochondrial stress are key endophenotypes of gestational disorders, this model provides mechanistic insight into how metabolic disorder risk is compounded throughout the life of a woman by preconception stress experience, including PSR, and has long-term consequences on maternal and offspring health outcomes, a process that may contribute to the racial

"Sex differences in the neurochemical mechanisms by which a stress peptide enhances nicotine reward and withdrawal Project Abstract  Tobacco use remains a major public health problem, particularly in women who are more vulnerable to the long-term consequences of smoking. Unfortunately, there is a critical knowledge gap regarding the underlying mechanisms by which stress promotes the behavioral effects of nicotine in females. The objective of this fellowship application is to investigate the role of stress systems in promoting nicotine reward and withdrawal in female rats. Our central hypothesis is that sex differences in the behavioral effects of nicotine are modulated via stress systems in the local circuits of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a terminal region of the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. The rationale for our hypothesis is based on our preliminary studies showing that viral- mediated over-expression of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) in the NAc selectively enhances the rewarding effects of nicotine in female versus male rats. Our mechanistic hypothesis is that sex differences in the behavioral effects of nicotine are modulated via inhibitory (GABA) and excitatory (glutamate) amino acids that regulate dopamine release in the NAc. Thus, the proposed studies will examine sex differences in the neurochemical effects of nicotine in female and male rats that received over-expression of CRF in the NAc (Aim 1). We predict that activation of CRF1 receptors following CRF over-expression produces a decrease in GABA transmission that results in enhanced dopamine release in the NAc of female versus male rats. We will examine whether these effects are CRF1 receptor mediated by infusing the CRF1 receptor antagonist, antalarmin into the NAc during our dialysate collections. Subsequent studies will examine sex differences in the neurochemical effects of nicotine withdrawal in female and male rats that received over-expression of CRF in the NAc (Aim 2). We predict that CRF over-expression will exacerbate the neurochemical effects of nicotine withdrawal via the emergence of large increases in glutamate release onto GABAergic interneurons. We expect that this effect will lead to a larger increase in GABA release that will contribute to a larger decrease in NAc dopamine release in female versus male rats. The project will provide important information regarding the role of stress systems in the behavioral effects of nicotine. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to the mission of NIH because our findings will be an important step toward elucidating the neural substrates that promote addiction pathology in women and support research at reducing the burden of tobacco abuse in women who are most vulnerable to the long-term effects of tobacco use.",Sex differences in the neurochemical mechanisms by which a stress peptide enhances nicotine reward and withdrawal,9928293,F31DA046126,"['Amino Acids ', ' aminoacid ', ' Anxiety ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone ', ' ACTH-Releasing Factor ', ' CRF-41 ', ' Corticoliberin ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Factor-41 ', ' Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone-41 ', ' corticotropin releasing hormone ', ' Dialysis procedure ', ' Dialysis ', ' dialysis therapy ', ' Dopamine ', ' Hydroxytyramine ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Exhibits ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' gamma-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutanoic Acid ', ' 4-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' 4-amino-butanoic acid ', ' Aminalon ', ' Aminalone ', ' GABA ', ' γ-Aminobutyric Acid ', ' Glutamates ', ' L-Glutamate ', ' glutamatergic ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Interneurons ', ' Connector Neuron ', ' Intercalary Neuron ', ' Intercalated Neurons ', ' Internuncial Cell ', ' Internuncial Neuron ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' male ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' neurochemistry ', ' neurochemical ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Nicotine ', ' Nicotine Dependence ', ' nicotine addiction ', ' nicotine dependent ', ' Nicotine Withdrawal ', ' Nucleus Accumbens ', ' Pathology ', ' Peptides ', ' Plasma ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Rattus ', ' Common Rat Strains ', ' Rat ', ' Rats Mammals ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Rewards ', ' Messenger RNA ', ' mRNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Smoke ', ' Smoking ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Stress ', ' Virus ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Technical Expertise ', ' technical skills ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Series ', ' Microdialysis ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' Withdrawal ', ' drug use ', ' Drug usage ', ' Female Groups ', "" Women's Group "", ' tobacco abuse ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Contralateral ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' Viral ', ' CRF-R1 ', ' CRF1 receptor ', ' CRH-1 ', ' Crh1 receptor ', ' corticotropin-releasing factor receptor 1 ', ' CRF receptor type 1 ', ' antalarmin ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Infusion ', ' Infusion procedures ', ' experience ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' receptor ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' skills ', ' pleasure ', ' novel ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Chemical Dependence ', ' Drug Dependence ', ' Drug Dependency ', ' Drug Addiction ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Collection ', ' Transmission ', ' transmission process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' vector control ', ' Coupled ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' overexpress ', ' overexpression ', ' behavior study ', ' behavioral study ', ' exposure to nicotine ', ' nicotine exposure ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,F31,2020,18474,0.02378519931992722
"Biopsychosocial Mechanisms Linking Gender Minority Stress to HIV Comorbidities Project Summary/Abstract Despite a high prevalence of HIV among gender minority women, very little is known about HIV comorbid conditions in this population. Understanding the mechanisms of underlying HIV-related comorbidities in this health disparity population is an important step toward advancing health equity. The address this gap in knowledge, the study seeks to elucidate pathways linking stigma and physiologic stress to HIV comorbidities among Black and Latina gender minority women. The specific aims of the project include to: (1) quantify the longitudinal relationship of stigma to chronic stress biomarkers; (2) identify pathways linking chronic stress biomarkers to HIV comorbidities; and (3) examine the role of chronic stress in pathways linking stigma, sex hormones, and HIV comorbidities. These aims will be met using existing NIH-funded cohort platforms to enroll and follow 200 participants in a 24-month, mixed-methods, prospective study to measure stigma, biomarkers of chronic stress, sex hormones, mental health, and CVD risk. Data will be collected at baseline, 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-months. This longitudinal study blends in-depth-interviews and quantitative psychosocial research with clinical and biological measures to advance understanding of the complex relationships between social experiences and physical health. This innovative research will identify mechanisms underlying associations between stigma and HIV comorbidities. It has important implications for interventions with health disparity populations living with HIV and will provide novel information that can be used to guide clinical practice and reduce health disparities. Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance A disproportionate number of gender minority women are living with HIV in the United States, yet information about mechanisms of disparities for their HIV-related comorbidities is quite limited. This research takes a step toward filling this gap by building on the existing infrastructure of current NIH-funded prospective cohorts.

"Social adversity, gestational stress physiology, and birth outcomes in Hispanic Americans PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This project addresses the epidemiological observation of increasing rates of obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) across generations of Hispanic Americans. We propose a novel hypothesis to understand this phenomenon based on the concepts of fetal programming, social determinants of health, and biological embedding of life experience. Evidence suggests that the embryonic/fetal phase of life represents a critical window during which perturbations in the intrauterine biochemical environment affect development of body tissue patterning and metabolic function, influencing an individual’s lifelong health and susceptibility to obesity and T2DM. We posit that social and cultural stressors among Hispanic immigrant women may influence stress biology in ways that—for women who become pregnant—alter the biochemical environment to which the developing embryo/fetus is exposed. Hispanic immigrants are an exceptionally disadvantaged group who are vulnerable to high degrees of social adversity. We propose the original hypothesis that pregnant, Hispanic immigrant women’s perceived social adversity may alter stress-related biological processes to influence adiposity and metabolic phenotypes in the fetus, thereby pre-disposing the offspring to enhanced lifelong risk of obesity and T2DM. In a prospective, longitudinal study of 100 pregnant, Hispanic immigrant women established with the PI’s K-award, we will assess perceived social adversity from a series of original open-ended questions, Likert-scale items, and validated questionnaires, and relate these constructs to stress biology assessed from biosamples collected at two timepoints during pregnancy, and newborn body mass index percentiles (BMIP). Newborn body size has well-established correlations with childhood and adulthood adiposity and metabolic risk. In this context, we will pursue two specific aims. In Aim 1, we will examine how pregnant women’s perceived social adversity (immigration-related trauma, political victimization, discrimination) relates to four domains of gestational stress physiology: hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal-placental, inflammatory, metabolic, and oxidative. In Aim 2, we will examine how pregnant women’s perceived social adversity relates to newborn BMIP. The expertise the PI gained in theory and analytic techniques for socio-cultural constructs, maternal-placental-fetal biology, adiposity and metabolism in her K01 training and research make her uniquely suited to successfully execute the R03 aims. Her K01 project, which focused on the possibility that acculturation may influence gestational biology, is logically extended in this R03 proposal by assessing other dimensions of socio-cultural stress, characterizing gestational stress physiology more comprehensively, and, importantly, directly measuring child outcomes. These endeavors will lay the foundation for an R01 proposal that will establish the PI as a fully independent investigator. Ultimately, these analyses may reveal new information about how experiences of social adversity can promote chronic disease states not only in the afflicted individuals but also across generations. Understanding the interplay between social, cultural, and biological mechanisms in minority health disparities may reveal new social, cultural, or biological targets of intervention to diminish inter-generational cycles of disadvantage and poor health in minority communities. This project emphasizes the possibility that investment in the well-being of girls and women can help alleviate health disparities. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH Obesity and type-2 diabetes mellitus are urgent and escalating problems in the Hispanic American community, and evidence suggests that propensity to develop these conditions is strongly influenced by the biochemical environment encountered during the prenatal stage of life. This study will examine how Hispanic immigrant pregnant women’s experiences of social adversity may relate to gestational stress physiological dynamics and newborn size at birth. Results may identify new social and physiological targets of intervention to promote women’s well-being in ways that could diminish inter-generational cycles of disadvantage and poor health in minority communities.","Social adversity, gestational stress physiology, and birth outcomes in Hispanic Americans",10038637,R03DK125524,"['Accounting ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', '

"Improving weight loss outcomes of black women using a culturally relevant, stress-management enhanced behavioral weight loss intervention Black females have the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity than any other racial-gender group in the United States with 4 out of 5 adult black females being overweight or obese. Furthermore, adult black females tend to lose less weight than whites undergoing the same obesity intervention regardless of treatment modality. Reasons for racial differences in weight loss outcomes are not fully understood, but suggest opportunities to further optimize obesity treatment approaches to reduce disparities. Behavioral weight loss (BWL) interventions offer one approach that has demonstrated effectiveness in promoting modest weight loss among some participants with obesity, but black females tend to lose less weight than their white counterparts in the same BWL program. We hypothesize that the higher prevalence of chronic psychological stress, which has been linked to weight gain over time and poorer weight loss in BWL programs, reported by black females contributes to the disproportionate prevalence of obesity and suboptimal weight loss observed among this group. Thus, stress management offers a novel approach to weight management for black females. Our preliminary work suggests that incorporating a strong stress management component into an evidence- based BWL program can potentially lead to better outcomes than an evidence-based BWL program alone. For this proposal, we will test the effectiveness of a 12-month culturally-targeted, stress management-enhanced BWL intervention on weight loss and stress reduction in a fully powered randomized, controlled trial (n=340). Adult black females with obesity will be randomized to either a stress-management enhanced BWL intervention (BWL-Stress) or the same BWL intervention alone (BWL-alone). The specific aims are to 1) conduct a randomized, controlled trial to determine the effects on body weight of BWL-Stress compared to BWL-Alone among adult black females with obesity and elevated stress, 2) evaluate intervention effects on psychological stress as measured by a validated survey instrument and a stress biomarker, and 3) using a multiple mediation model, test whether the relationship between the intervention and weight change is mediated by perceived stress, energy intake, and physical activity. The primary outcome is weight change at month 6. Secondary outcomes will include changes in stress measures (e.g., survey measures, cortisol), blood glucose, energy intake, and physical activity at month 6. We will also assess process measures (e.g, treatment adherence, treatment burden). We will also evaluate each outcome at month 12. This novel approach for enhancing an evidence-based BWL program with culturally-targeted stress management strategies for black females targets an understudied contributor to weight management among a population at high risk for obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases (e.g. type 2 diabetes, cancer). This study will also elucidate behavioral mechanisms linking our novel intervention to study outcomes. If proven effective, it would have significant clinical and public health implications for weight management among black females. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Obesity is a significant public health concern that is disproportionately represented among adult black females. Current obesity treatment strategies among this population produce suboptimal weight loss outcomes. This project will determine whether addressing stress management among a group of adult black females with obesity and elevated stress will lead to greater weight loss than standard behavioral weight loss programs.","Improving weight loss outcomes of black women using a culturally relevant, stress-management enhanced behavioral weight loss intervention",10028373,R01DK125367,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Glucose ', ' Blood Sugar ', ' Body Weight ', ' Body Weight Changes ', ' Weight Change ', ' Energy Intake ', ' Caloric Intake ', ' caloric dietary content ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Energy Metabolism ', ' Energy Expenditure ', ' Female ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Weight Gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' wt gain ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Process Measure ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Salivary ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' Outcome Study ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' weight control ', ' weight management ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' diabetes risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Mechanisms of Behavior and Behavior Change ', ' behavior mechanism ', ' Behavioral Mechanisms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' life-time risk ', ' lifetime risk ', ' trend ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' Behavioral ', ' systematic review ', ' diabetes prevention program ', ' obesity treatment ', ' new approaches ', ' novel approaches ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel strategies ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' life style intervention ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' weight loss intervention ', ' risk for obesity ', ' risk of obesity ', ' obesity risk ', ' high risk ', ' combat ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' group intervention ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' treatment strategy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' treatment adherence ', ' intervention effect ', ' arm ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' stress reduction ', ' weight loss programming ', ' weight loss program ', ' perceived stress ', ' Obesity Epidemic ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2020,576767,0.04431840824044872
"Minority Stress Reactivity and Hazardous Drinking PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Disparities in hazardous drinking and alcohol use disorder (AUD) have been documented across several disadvantaged groups (e.g., racial/ethnic and sexual minorities). Hazardous drinking and its consequences are a major public health priority and concern given their significant economic, mortality, and morbidity burdens. Stigma and discrimination-related stressors (i.e., minority stressors) contribute to our understanding of health disparities among these groups. Given the importance of minority stressors in predicting hazardous drinking, the research aims of this Mentored Clinical Scientist Research Career Development Award (K08) are to conduct a rigorous, innovative, and multi-method examination of minority stress and its effects on drinking in the lab and the natural environment among one disadvantaged health disparities group. Sexual minority (SM; i.e., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) adults are at increased risk for hazardous drinking compared to heterosexuals. SMs experience minority stressors, which range from daily and momentary slights to more acute forms of stigma, and are directly correlated with hazardous drinking. However, major limitations of the extant SM literature include the lack of objective measures of reactivity to minority stressors (i.e., biological markers), overreliance on cross-sectional data, and failure to account for individual differences in appraisals of minority stress or the contributions of minority stress on hazardous drinking beyond individual differences in daily general stress and lifetime cumulative stress. In addition, little is known about mediating mechanisms between minority stress and hazardous drinking. Consistent with Institute of Medicine and NIH’s call to expand the scientific knowledge base on factors contributing to SMs’ elevated rates of drinking, the research aims of this K08 are to: 1) examine the effects of psychophysiological mechanisms underpinning appraised minority stress and alcohol craving in a lab experiment of 70 SMs who are at most risk for developing AUD (i.e., heavy drinkers); and 2) use experience sampling methods (i.e., EMA) over a 30-day period, to examine: a) the effects of psychophysiological stress reactivity from the lab on minority stress reactivity and drinking in the natural environment and b) the prospective effects of minority stress on proximal changes in affect and drinking and its consequences in real time. While conducting this research and participating in several training and mentorship activities, the K08 candidate will develop new expertise in: 1) experimental laboratory research; 2) psychophysiological stress research and salivary research methodology; 3) experience sampling field methods (i.e., EMA); and 4) advanced statistical approaches for analyzing intensive longitudinal EMA quantitative data and physiological salivary laboratory data. This proposed project builds upon the candidate’s past work examining the associations between minority stressors and health outcomes among sexual and racial/ethnic minorities. Completion of this K08 award will provide the candidate necessary skills to be an independent researcher capable of advancing our knowledge of stress-specific factors predicting hazardous drinking. PROJECT NARRATIVE: PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT Sexual minorities (SMs; i.e., lesbian, gay, or bisexual) are at increased risk for hazardous drinking, alcohol- related consequences, and alcohol use disorder (AUD) than heterosexuals. Hazardous drinking and its consequences are a major public health concern given resulting economic, societal, mortality, and morbidity burdens. The project will address how SMs’ experiences with stigma-based stressors related to their sexual orientation (i.e., minority stressors) are associated with hazardous drinking in order to inform and develop alcohol interventions and improve the well-being of SMs.",Minority Stress Reactivity and Hazardous Drinking,9984924,K08AA025011,"['Accounting ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' alcohol use disorder ', ' ethanol use disorder ', ' Award ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Literature ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' Public Health ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Imagery ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Heavy Drinker ', ' Alcoholic beverage heavy drinker ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' System ', ' ethanol craving ', ' alcohol craving ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' HPA axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' skills ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' drinking ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' craving ', ' response ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' alcohol intervention ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' drinking behavior ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' hazardous drinking ', ' alcohol related consequences ', ' public health priorities ', ' sexual minority ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' lab assignment ', ' lab experiment ', ' laboratory activity ', ' laboratory assignment ', ' laboratory exercise ', ' laboratory experiment ', ' prospective test ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' individual heterogeneity ', ' individual variability ', ' individual variation ', ' sexual identity ', ' ']",NIAAA,AMERICAN UNIVERSITY,K08,2020,169287,0.054046268566919894
"Post Maria Puerto Rican Families Relocated to Florida:  A Multisite Study of Alcohol Misuse and Mental Health Problems Project Summary/Abstract In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans sought refuge on the US mainland, with the majority relocating to South and Central Florida. More than one year after the hurricane, frontline journalism and our preliminary research make clear that many post-Maria survivors plan to stay on the US mainland for the foreseeable future. And yet, at present, our understanding of displaced Puerto Ricans remains very limited. Data from our pilot studies and our ongoing work suggests that, among the myriad issues faced by this population, alcohol misuse and mental health problems are particularly serious challenges. Of concern, in particular, is that stress and trauma caused by the storm will lead to greater alcohol misuse and mental health problems among Puerto Rican adults and their children, especially when coupled with the migration-related cultural stress stemming from an unplanned, abrupt, and long-term displacement from the island territory with its distinct culture and language. The proposed study is oriented around three objectives designed to build in a programmatic fashion. The first objective relates to the emerging public health needs of migrants in the aftermath of the storm; namely, to provide an epidemiologic portrait of the characteristics, experiences, and needs of post-Maria Puerto Rican families who relocated to Florida. The second objective focuses on broader theoretical issues related to post-disaster migration and adaptation; namely, to examine the prospective association between [a] trauma, cultural stress, family functioning and [b] alcohol misuse and mental health problems, and to conduct a differential test of cultural stress theory in South and Central Florida to inform intervention development in each region. Based on our prior research and cultural stress theory, our central hypothesis is that families relocating to South Florida (a bilingual region where Latino cultural influences are celebrated) will experience less migration-related cultural stress and, consequently, enjoy greater family functioning and fewer alcohol misuse and mental health problems compared to those in Central Florida (an area with a relatively recent uptick in Puerto Rican and other Latino migration). The third objective focuses on ensuring—via engagement with stakeholders and participants—that study findings are effectively translated to real world practice. The scientific premise for this study is to inform efforts to support displaced Puerto Ricans and advance theorizing on disaster-related migration and health. We will pursue the following specific aims: [1] Describe the characteristics, experiences, and needs post-Maria Puerto Rican families in Florida; [2] Examine prospective relationships to test cultural stress theory across distinct resettlement contexts; and [3] Engage with stakeholders and participants to develop guidelines, best practices, and intervention recommendations for dissemination and testing in future research. The contribution of this study is significant because it lays groundwork for the development of evidence-based interventions for the needs of an at-risk group, and promises to answer context-specific questions central to the advancement of cultural stress theory and broader theorizing around migrant adaptation and key outcomes. Project Narrative: Public Health Relevance The proposed research is relevant to public health because it will provide critical insight into the disaster- and migration-related experiences of Puerto Rican families in the aftermath of one of the costliest natural disasters in United States' history. Such research would provide information vital to the development of evidence-based programs designed to target alcohol misuse and mental health problems among a large and at-risk population of US-citizen migrants. The proposed project is highly relevant to NIMHD's mission in that it will directly inform efforts to address alcohol misuse and mental health problems among a subgroup of minority and vulnerable families who are experiencing significant health disparities related to stress, trauma, and migration-related consequences.",Post Maria Puerto Rican Families Relocated to Florida:  A Multisite Study of Alcohol Misuse and Mental Health Problems,9995574,R01MD014694,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Disasters ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Electricity ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Florida ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hurricane ', ' Interview ', ' Island ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mission ', ' Natural Disasters ', ' Parents ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Rain ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Water ', ' Hydrogen Oxide ', ' Work ', ' Latino ', ' Longitudinal Surveys ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' ETOH level ', ' alcohol level ', ' ethanol measurement ', ' ethyl alcohol measurements ', ' alcohol measurement ', ' Left ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Survivors ', ' Ensure ', ' insight ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' WWW ', ' web ', ' world wide web ', ' Internet ', ' bilingual ', ' bilingualism ', ' Knowledge ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Distant ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Journalism ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Portraits ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' ethanol misuse ', ' unhealthy alcohol use ', ' alcohol misuse ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' migration ', ' Trauma ', ' Coupled ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Evidence based program ', ' stem ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' public health relevance ', ' traumatic event ', ' Migrant ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2020,639193,0.01550847622086573
"Intergenerational Transmission of Stress: Psychosocial and Biological Mechanisms PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite growing evidence that health outcomes are perpetuated across generations, empirical examinations of putative mechanisms underlying this intergenerational transmission are lacking. Explanatory mechanisms often focus on stress, which manifests in both psychological and physical symptoms. Relevant pathways have primarily been tested within a single generation or in non-human animal research. From mouse to man, evidence suggests that interplay across stress-related biological (e.g., cortisol, inflammation, telomeres) and psychosocial (e.g., social integration, health behaviors) factors critically contribute to the intergenerational transmission of health. The proposed study will examine the psychosocial ad biological mechanisms through which adversity transmits adverse mental and physical health outcomes across 3 generations and promotes the maintenance of health disparities. To this end, we will leverage a large (G1, n=1,630) and diverse (33% African-American) sample of older adults (currently aged 64-73) enrolled in an ongoing NIH-funded longitudinal study of stress and health and recruit their children (G2, n=2,200) and grandchildren (G3, n=1,900) to complete self-report questionnaires assessing stress, psychosocial factors, and health. From these, a subsample of 300 (150 Black and 150 White) G1/G2/G3 triads (total N=900) will visit our lab to provide blood and saliva measures so that we may assay the stress hormone cortisol, as well as inflammation markers. We will assay both their basal function and evoked activity. Triads and dyads will return to the lab 2.5 years later for a repeat assessment. All measures will be integrated with existing G1 data from our ongoing longitudinal samples. Investigating the intergenerational transmission of stress-related psychosocial and biological factors promises to inform our understanding of how health outcomes and racial health disparities are perpetuated across generations and, may, ultimately guide targeted prevention and public policy. PROJECT NARRATIVE/RELEVANCE Health outcomes and disparities are frequently perpetuated across generations, but little is known about mechanisms that might contribute to this challenging problem. The current project examines how adversity (e.g., socioeconomic status, childhood maltreatment, stressful life events, discrimination), psychosocial (e.g., health behaviors, social integration) and biological (e.g., stress hormones, inflammatory signaling) factors contribute to physical and mental health across three generations in a large (>5,500), racially diverse (33% Black) sample. Understanding the role of adversity, as well as psychosocial and biological factors in the intergenerational transmission of health will aid efforts to disrupt the continuation of health problems and

"Improving maternal and child health through prenatal fatty acid supplementation: A randomized controlled study in African American women living in low-income urban environments ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pregnant women living in poverty often experience chronic stress and consequently higher levels of stress hormones. In utero exposure to high levels of stress hormones can negatively affect the developing fetus and the infant's capacity for emotion and behavioral regulation. In this application we describe a developing program of research designed to reduce the negative impact of prenatal stress on infant health and development via nutritional supplementation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) during pregnancy. DHA is a long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid member of the omega-3 fatty acid family. DHA is found in its highest concentrations in neural cell membranes, affecting receptor function, neurotransmitter uptake, and signal transmission. There is growing evidence that low levels of dietary DHA intake are associated with suboptimal response to stress and that DHA supplementation can modulate stress response. Aims: The goals of the proposed study are to test whether DHA supplementation during pregnancy is associated with 1) improved maternal health during pregnancy among African American women living in urban poverty; 2) improved infant birth and neurodevelopmental outcomes, and 3) whether the association between DHA supplementation during pregnancy and infant outcomes is partially mediated by reductions in maternal perceived stress and stress reactivity during pregnancy. Approach: One hundred sixty-two pregnant African American women living in urban poverty, who consume less than two servings of fish per week, will be randomly assigned to receive 450 mg/daily of DHA or placebo beginning at 9-12 weeks of gestation through the end of pregnancy. Perceived stress, stressful life events, anxiety, and depression, inflammatory markers, DHA levels and response to a laboratory stressor will be assessed at baseline and at 24, 30, and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Neonatal outcomes (e.g., gestational age, birth weight, delivery complications) will be collected from medical records, and infant neurodevelopmental outcomes and stress reactivity will be assessed at 1, 4 and 9 months of age. Investigators: This application builds on a recently completed NICHD/NIMH funded R21 (PI: Keenan), which yielded preliminary evidence that DHA supplementation during pregnancy reduces perceived stress and cortisol response to stress in pregnant African American women living in low-income, urban environments. Drs. Keenan and Hipwell and Ms. Wroblewksi were investigators on the R21 and will continue to work together on the proposed study. Dr. Della Torre is an Assistant Professor of Obstetrics at the University of Chicago, who specializes in providing clinical services to African American women living in the south side of Chicago. Innovation: This will be the first large randomized controlled study of the effect of DHA supplementation in pregnant African American women living in urban poverty on maternal and infant health and stress response. Impact: If DHA supplementation is associated with reductions in perceived stress, more modulated maternal cortisol response to stress, and more optimal emotional and behavioral regulation in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program of research on the mechanisms by which these associations evolve can be launched and broad-based prevention interventions that target maternal and child in vulnerable populations can be implemented, potentially leading to reductions health disparities in the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This is a study of the effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in pregnant women living in urban, low-income environments on stress regulation during pregnancy. If essential fatty acid supplementation is associated with reductions in the experience of stress, more modulated biological response to stress, and more optimal stress regulation and neurodevelopment in the infant, even within the context urban poverty, then a comprehensive program on the mechanisms by which nutrition reduces the negative impact on prenatal stress on the offspring can be launched. This study may be the first step toward broad-based prevention of suboptimal birth and developmental outcomes among children born to African American women living in poverty.",Improving maternal and

"Impact of social factors on breast cancer biology in African-American women ABSTRACT African American (AA) women are more likely to be diagnosed at an early age with breast cancer (BC), have aggressive disease and experience greater mortality, compared to their Caucasian American (CA) counterparts. Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress have long been believed to be the prime cause of such health disparities; however, it is not yet well understood how these social factors are translated into increased cancer risk, aggressive tumor-subtypes, and poor clinical outcomes. Demographic data suggest that AA women encounter more socioeconomic difficulties than CA women and social stressors impact human biology through epigenomic modifications of gene functions. MicroRNAs, which are important epigenetic modulators of gene expression and key players in human biology and disease, are known to be regulated by stress hormones/cytokines and exhibit differential expression in socially disadvantaged population. Along these lines, our published and preliminary studies have identified increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and stress hormones (resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol), and certain microRNAs (miR-511, miR-27a, and miR-33a) in AA women (with or without BC). We have also observed that treatment of BC cells and macrophages with resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol leads to an upregulation of miR-511, miR-27a, and miR-33a, promotes growth and malignant behavior of BC cells, and induces M2 polarization of macrophages. These compelling findings build a strong scientific premise for this project and support our hypothesis that socioeconomic hardships promote chronic inflammation and stress leading to altered serum levels of hormones and cytokines (such as resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol), which in turn, modulate the expression of immune-suppressive and tumor- promoting miRNAs, eventually contributing to BC pathogenesis. In four specific aims, we propose to determine global changes in circulating microRNAs in serum of AA and CA women (with or without BC) and establish their correlation with SES (low/moderate/high) (Aim 1); analyze levels of resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol in serum, and study their association with SES and serum miRNAs (Aim 2); examine regulation of miRNAs by resistin, IL6, leptin, and cortisol and delineate the underlying mechanisms (Aim 3); and establish the pathobiological significance of differentially-expressed miRNAs (Aim 4). Together, these studies will establish the functional association between socioeconomic health determinants and breast tumor biology, and support the role of miRNAs as epigenomic modifiers that link the social stress to biological phenotypes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Socioeconomic factors are suggested to affect gene function and thereby influence health trajectories or modify disease risk in the racial/ethnic minority and health disparity populations. The proposed research will characterize global changes in serum microRNAs (epigenomic regulators of gene expression) of African American women, establish their correlative association with socioeconomic status and physiological stress caused by social hardships, and generate experimental support for these associations at the mechanistic and functional levels. Resulting data is expected to support the role of miRNAs as epigenomic modifiers linking social stress to biological phenotypes, which, in the longer-term, will help in planning effective strategies to reduce existing disparity gaps in the health outcomes.",Impact of social factors on breast cancer biology in African-American women,9968187,R01CA231925,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Alabama ', ' Behavior ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Exhibits ', ' Female ', ' Florida ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Genes ', ' Regulator Genes ', ' Transcriptional Regulatory Elements ', ' regulatory gene ', ' trans acting element ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Household ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Inflammation ', ' Institutes ', ' macrophage ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Poverty ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Publishing ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Shoulder ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Genetic Transcription ', ' Gene Transcription ', ' RNA Expression ', ' Transcription ', ' Translating ', ' Up-Regulation ', ' Upregulation ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' cytokine ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Malignant ', ' Malignant -

"Social adversities, epigenetics, and the obesity epidemic Project Summary. This application is being submitted in response to PAR-16-355, Social Epigenomics Research Focused on Minority Health and Health Disparities (R01), and the overarching long-term goal of this research effort is to learn how to positively influence health trajectories, modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for obesity in youth. Obesity was selected as the primary health outcome as it is a health measure with widening racial/ethnic disparities over the past three decades, and it is a potent predictor of a host of negative social, educational, vocational, and health outcomes later in life. In this study we propose to leverage two ongoing prenatal cohorts in Florida and North Carolina, and recruit a sample of 470 pregnant women and follow their children to 24 months of age. The sample will be enriched for adversity in pregnancy and approximately evenly divided among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic subjects. We will assess the impact of mothers' prenatal stress on measures of DNA methylation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which are homogenous in terms of cellular composition, and widely accepted as an optimal choice for examining in utero responses to stressors. In the epigenetic analyses we will use both targeted and big data approaches, using pyrosequencing to measure methylation of 31 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) that regulate ~90 known imprinted genes, and the Illumina HumanMethylationEPIC (850k) bead chip for whole epigenome analyses. We will also assess maternal and child postnatal psychosocial stress exposure, and child growth in the first 24 months of life. Children who are overweight at any point during the first two years of life have an approximately six-fold increased risk for obesity at five years of age, and risk for chronic health problems across the lifecycle. The primary hypotheses of this study build on preliminary work from our group and include: 1) Maternal prenatal stress will be associated with increased DMRs regulating the expression of imprinted gene insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and maternally expressed gene 3 (MEG3) DMR, increased methylation in Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CAMK4) gene, and methylation changes in novel CpG sites identified in the 850K analyses; 2) DNA methylation profile changes associated with prenatal stress will be related to alterations in gene expression; and 3) Methylation markers identified in Aim 1 will predict growth trajectories and measures of obesity at 24 months of age. Secondary analyses will examine several moderating factors, including: maternal Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE), maternal social supports, maternal postnatal psychosocial distress, postnatal offspring ACE, genetic variants, and relevant confounding variables. The mediating role of inflammatory markers will also be explored, and saliva DNA specimens will be collected on the full cohort at 24-months and 50 children at birth, allowing for tests of comparability of DNA methylation between HUVECs and saliva, and the stability of markers over time. Project Narrative. Chronic exposure to psychosocial stress often accompanies the experience of poverty and racial/ethnic minority status, and may be causally related to health disparities. This grant is designed to unravel the mechanisms by which social adversity confers risk for negative health outcomes to learn how to best modify disease risk in racial/ethnic minorities, and reduce

"An Interpersonal Relationships Intervention for Improving Cardiovascular Health in Youth PROJECT SUMMARY Disparities in cardiovascular (CV) diseases by socioeconomic status (SES) and race/ethnicity are pronounced in our society, and the processes that lead to these disparities begin in childhood. Previous intervention efforts have targeted individual lifestyle changes in health behaviors, but with limited success in low SES, minority youth. We propose a novel intervention to reduce CV risk in low SES, minority children (under 21 by NIH guidelines) that focuses on social relationships – specifically mentoring – as a way to create bi-directional benefits for CV health in youth. The rationale for this intervention is based both on work showing that receiving social support has benefits for physical health, and on work demonstrating that helping others is associated with better physical health. In this proposed intervention study, college students will serve as mentors to elementary school students (8th graders). 250 college students and 250 Chicago Public School 8th graders will be randomized to either serve as a mentor/mentee or to be in a control group. Students will participate in a weekly mentoring intervention throughout one school year. Assessments will occur at 3 time points during the school year. All mentors and mentees will come from low-income families and underrepresented minority groups, thus allowing us to focus on improving CV health in an at-risk population that experiences a disproportionate share of the CV burden in the U.S. The first aim of the project is to investigate whether mentors can reduce CV risk (obesity; blood pressure; cholesterol; blood glucose) in low-income, minority youth mentees relative to a control group of 8th graders. The second aim is to investigate whether serving as a mentor can reduce CV risk in the college student mentors compared to a control group of college students. The third aim is to understand how mentoring influences the intervention targets of psychosocial, health behavior, and biological variables, and whether these variables mediate the impact of mentoring on CV health. Drawing from the stress buffering model of social support, we propose that mentoring fosters the development of strong social relationships that can scaffold behavioral changes and hence mitigate the effects that stress has on inflammation and CV health via 2 pathways: psychophysiological and health behaviors. In the psychophysiological pathway, mentoring creates more adaptive cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses to life stressors, which in turn mitigate responses of the sympathetic and neuroendocrine systems to stress. Over time, this reduces inflammation and improves CV health. In the health behaviors pathway, the scaffolding from mentoring relationships mitigates the associations of stress with detrimental health behaviors that in turn are linked to both inflammation and CV health. Through this study, we take a social relationships- oriented primary prevention approach to reducing health disparities by targeting CV risk factors that emerge early in life and that predict clinical CV disease outcomes into adulthood and by focusing on low-income, minority mentors and mentees who represent an at-risk, underserved, and disadvantaged group of youth. PROJECT NARRATIVE/PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT This project will implement a mentoring intervention pairing low-income minority college students as mentors to low-income minority elementary school students, and investigate the effects of mentoring on the cardiovascular health of both mentees and mentors. From a single intervention, we have the potential to create cardiovascular health benefits among both younger youth (mentees) and older youth (mentors) simultaneously through a novel approach that focuses on the beneficial influences that a social relationship between a mentor and mentee can have in helping to scaffold positive behavioral changes. This project takes a primary prevention approach by focusing on cardiovascular risk factors that emerge during childhood and as well, targets health disparities by focusing on an at-risk group of

"Social stressors and inflammation: A mixed methods approach to preterm birth African American women have 1.5 times the rates of preterm birth (PTB) (<37 weeks completed gestation) compared with non-Hispanic white women. This disproportionately high PTB rate in African Americans is a persistent health inequity that leads to high child mortality, morbidity, and developmental delays. In the U.S. approximately $26 billion are spent annually on health care costs for infants and children that were born prematurely. Recent attempts to explain the high PTB rates in African American women have focused on social stressors, such as disadvantaged neighborhoods, racial discrimination, and stressful life events. These social stressors may lead to PTB by increasing women’s emotional stress levels. Not surprisingly, emotional stress along with levels of the stress hormone cortisol and systemic inflammation - both physiological responses to stress - have all been related to higher risk of PTB. In contrast, one’s psychosocial resources (e.g., social support) can lessen emotional stress and have protective effects on PTB. Little is yet known about the pathways by which social stressors affect inflammation, and ultimately PTB. The objective of the proposed study is to determine how social stressors alter inflammation during pregnancy and lead to PTB in African American women. We aim to: 1) determine the pathways by which social stressors affect PTB; and 2) describe social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; the associations among these concepts; and their impact on PTB from women’s perspectives.  In this longitudinal convergent mixed methods design, we will enroll 1,500 African American women who live in the Detroit metropolitan area. We will collect data on social stressors, emotional stress, and psychosocial resources through questionnaires and administrative (e.g., census) data. This will be done three times prenatally. At these same time points, levels of cortisol and systemic inflammation will be determined from hair and blood samples, respectively. We will also obtain birth data from the prenatal and hospital records. In a subsample of 60 women, semi-structured interviews will be conducted to more specifically understand the associations among social stressors, emotional stress and psychosocial resources; and their impact on PTB. We will conduct a variety of statistical, qualitative and mixed methods analyses using both quantitative and qualitative data to determine answers to the aims of our study. We will also consider the timing of pregnancy in our analyses, as the prenatal data are collected at three distinct time points. The proposed research is highly relevant to NIH’s mission to elucidate mechanisms underlying health disparities in PTB. Insights gained from this mixed methods approach may lead to the development of an individualized PTB risk profile based on a woman's social stressors and biomarkers which will have potential use in clinical practice and be a target for culturally appropriate interventions to reduce PTB incidence in African American women, and will generate new perspectives for future research in other racial groups through our detailed focus on this high risk group. Preterm birth is a major risk for neonatal mortality and long-term child health problems, including motor and mental developmental delays and chronic illness. Knowledge of the social context of African American women’s lives will increase our understanding of why some women have poor pregnancy outcomes, generate new perspectives for future research, inform new lines of inquiry regarding the pathways through which stress affects preterm birth in other racial groups, contribute to the development of culturally appropriate interventions to reduce racial disparities in preterm birth, and ultimately improve birth outcomes.",Social stressors and inflammation: A mixed methods approach to preterm birth,10076266,R01MD011575,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' antiinflammatory ', ' Anxiety ', ' Birth Rate ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Censuses ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Hormones ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Hospital Records ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Incidence ', ' Infant ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity -

"Effects of Social Networks and Policy Context on Health among Older Sexual and Gender Minorities in the US South ABSTRACT Older sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations experience significant disparities in morbidity and disability compared with their heterosexual and cisgender counterparts. There are two primary explanations as to why physical health, mental health, and disability outcomes may differ for older SGM adults compared to older heterosexual and cisgender adults: 1) experiences of minority stress that negatively affect health over the life course, and 2) differences in the kind and quality of social networks and support in older age. In this study we develop and test a new conceptual model that integrates these two disparate areas of research by applying a multilevel approach to understanding how minority stress processes work. We contend that social networks mediate the relationship between minority stress and health. Social network effects may be negative, exacerbating the effects of negative life experiences of discrimination or violence by reinforcing feelings of negative marginality relative to dominant societal values and structures. Alternatively, social networks may buffer the effects of negative life experiences among SGM adults whose networks include more positive valuations of SGM identities. To test this model, we will collect in-depth ego-centric network data over three waves from 800 SGM adults aged 50 to 70 years and residing in the metropolitan statistical areas of three midsize cities in the US South: Nashville, TN; Birmingham, AL; and Raleigh, NC. Participants will be recruited using multiple face-to-face, community and targeted online methods in order to ensure inclusion of more isolated individuals or individuals who are less involved with community organizations. Surveys will be administered using a web-based instrument developed specifically for assessing multidimensional aspects of personal networks, physical and mental health, and experiences of minority stress. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE This project is important for public health because sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations experience substantial disparities in morbidity, mental health, and physical disability as they age. In this longitudinal panel study of minority stress, social networks, and health among older SGM adults in the United States, it will be possible to see how a person's social networks--and the attendant support they provide--shape individuals' responses to negative life experiences, including discrimination, harassment, and violence, and the effects of these life experiences on physical and mental health, morbidity, and disability. Understanding how networks and social support may mediate the effects of negative life events on health will have important policy and prevention implications for reducing health disparities by sexual orientation and gender identity, especially as the SGM population in the United States ages.",Effects of Social Networks and Policy Context on Health among Older Sexual and Gender Minorities in the US South,10101878,R01AG063771,"['social ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' community organizations ', ' public health relevance ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' support network ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' morbidity disparities ', ' disparities in morbidity ', ' data access ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' recruit ', ' Service provision ', ' protective factors ', ' individualized response ', ' individual response ', ' sexual identity ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Buffers ', ' California ', ' Cities ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Ego ', ' Family ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Life Experience ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Politics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' San Francisco ', ' Social Policies ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Shapes ', ' instrument ', ' Life ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' metropolitan ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' research study ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Prevention ', ' ']",NIA,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,107211,0.014480420649059399
"Defining behaviors and the stress response among positive deviants for childhood obesity PROJECT SUMMARY This R03 award seeks to identify existing successful strategies to address childhood obesity in low socioeconomic status populations. A small proportion (10-15%) of children with obesity in early childhood achieve a healthy weight by adolescence. The goal of the overall project is to identify what behaviors these children and their families, termed positive deviants, have implemented that has been effective. By learning from what is already working among communities at high risk of continued obesity, interventions can be adapted to be more relevant and effective for families of children with obesity. The paucity of interventions shown to be effective for low socioeconomic status families and the increasing disparities in obesity for this population underscore the need to identify effective strategies. Aim 1 will use existing medical record data to examine weight trajectories from pre-adolescent, school aged children and categorize children into those who have a negative BMI slope towards a healthy weight (positive deviants) and children with a flat or increasing BMI slope (controls). Families are recruited to participate in a case-control study using mixed methods to define the skills and behaviors used to address their child's weight. In aim 2, we examine the biologic response to stress using cortisol, interleukin-6 and C-reactive protein, comparing positive deviants and controls to test the hypothesis that positive deviants, despite experiencing similar stressors, have a different biologic response to stress than controls. The completion of these aims will directly inform the design of an obesity-focused clinical trial testing the effectiveness of positive deviance- derived strategies paired with interventions designed to mitigate stress using biologic markers to personalize interventions. The project will occur in an exceptional research environment for using the resources of the Oregon Clinical and Translational Research Institute (OCTRI) to assist with data abstraction from a large medical record to generate the dataset. Dr. Foster (PI) has recently completed a similar project during his K23 award, with this project designed to build on the lessons learned during the K23 and strategically expand as a step towards an R01 application for testing the effectiveness of interventions designed using this approach. PROJECT NARRATIVE Some families of children with obesity successfully address their child's weight, and the child achieves a healthy weight. The work described aims to learn from these successful families – examining both behaviors and the biologic response to stress.

"Early Life Adversity, Cumulative Life Stress, Race, and Cellular Aging in Midlife Women and Offspring Early Life Adversity, Cumulative Stress, Race, & Cell Aging in Midlife Women & Offspring BACKGROUND: There is an increasingly recognized role of stress in elevating disease risk, especially among women, minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. Few prospective studies follow individuals from childhood to adulthood, leaving critical unanswered questions such as which types of adversity, and life periods (childhood, adolescence, adulthood, or cumulative) have the greatest impact on biological aging and can help explain racial differences in health. We have a remarkable opportunity to examine types of lifespan stress in a longitudinal cohort of black and white women who have been followed from 10 years old. We have collected multiple sources of stress, including individual stressors (severe life events, chronic stressors, global perceived stress) and environmental stressors (neighborhood deprivation and violence). Our broad aim is to conduct a novel examination of adversity and links to current epigenomic markers (telomere length, epigenetic aging) in women and their children, and to systemic inflammation in the women. In this re- submission, we have identified archived serum samples from the womens’ childhood baseline visit and are thus able to examine change in inflammation as well. These indices of biological aging each serve as a reliable predictor of early disease. METHOD: We are conducting a 30 year follow up of the prospective NHLBI Growth and Health Study (NGHS), a biracial cohort of children to examine intergenerational transmission of obesity (R01 HD073568). Black and white girls were initially followed prospectively from 10 to 20 years old and are now being enrolled at roughly 39 years old. Here we propose to assess indices of cellular aging in 590 NGHS women and their most recent (index) child. Retention of sample and adherence to blood and saliva sampling are excellent and an R56 helped us ensure our target sample size. We will assess whether lifespan stress is associated with indices of accelerated cellular aging at age 39, and for inflammation, change from childhood (Aim 1) and secondarily whether types of stress (severe events, chronic stressors, global perceptions, neighborhood deprivation) or time-periods (childhood, adolescence, adulthood) have differential or cumulative effects. We will assess whether pregnancy stress or lifespan stress is associated with offspring epigenomic markers (Aim 2), and whether race modifies these effects (Aim 3). Lastly, we will explore whether high resilience (support and self- esteem) buffers the effects of adversity. SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATION: This will be the first prospective study to test lifespan stress predictors of three distinct indices of biological aging, each representing different pathways of aging, in a biracial cohort and to assess stress effects on offspring epigenome. This should advance our understanding of lifespan stress on aging biology. A more granular understanding of the types and timing of stress that impact aging processes is necessary for designing policies and programs that reduce socioeconomic disparities in health and aging. PROJECT NARRATIVE Growing black/white disparities in health across generations has reached a critical juncture, and these differences may be due in part to greater stress exposures, which in turn may accelerate cellular aging processes. This study examines how different types of stress through the lifespan—such as traumatic events and chronic situations, perceptions of stress, and neighborhood deprivation-- might accelerate aging processes (as indexed by telomere length, epigenetic age, and inflammation) in a longitudinal cohort of biracial girls followed from age 10 and now 39, and whether their stress exposures also predict their offpsrings’ biological aging. A better understanding of the types of stress that impact health and intergenerational transmission of risk, as well as the potentially protective effects of psychological resiliency factors such as social support, will help inform the design of policies and programs that reduce racial and socioeconomic disparities in premature aging and disease.","Early Life Adversity, Cumulative Life Stress,

"Socio-Cultural Stress Profiles, Stress Responses, and Health in Mexican American Adolescents This project is in response to PA-17-042 and examines the longitudinal influence of socio-cultural stressors, physiological and behavioral stress responses to these stressors, and health outcomes of adolescents in Mexican immigrant families. Recognizing the challenging social environments in which adolescents in Mexican immigrant families are embedded, this project creates socio-cultural stress profiles comprised of economic stress, discrimination and foreigner stress, and language brokering experiences (in which children translate between English and Spanish for their English-limited parents). Our ongoing research with adolescents in Mexican immigrant families has identified three socio-cultural stress profiles (moderate, protective, risk), three stable profiles over time (stable moderate, stable protective, stable risk), and two socio-cultural change profiles over time (improved, declined). The proposed project builds on a successful study of adolescents in Mexican immigrant families (PI: Kim, NSF, BCS-0956123 and BCS-651128; NIH, R03HD060045) to examine, prospectively, the influence of socio-cultural stress profiles in middle school alone, as well as continuity and change in socio-cultural stress profiles from middle school to high school, on adolescent health (Aim 1). Specifically, this grant will allow the research team to add measures of physiological health outcomes, namely inflammation (IL-6, C-reactive protein) and diabetes risk (hemoglobin A1c). We will also test a pathways model, to determine whether socio-cultural stress profiles are associated with adaptive or maladaptive physiological and behavioral stress responses that influence health (Aim 2). Further, we propose to test whether the associations from socio-cultural stress profiles to stress responses to health outcomes are exacerbated or mitigated through various moderators, including personal (resilience, parent support) and cultural (family obligation) resources, stress related to legal status, and language brokering places and content (Aim 3). Physiological stress response will be assessed via cortisol. Acute cortisol will be assessed by measuring reactivity and recovery to an adaptation of the Trier Social Stress Test, in which adolescents verbally translate a medical document for their parents. Day-to-day cortisol will also be measured. Substance use and sleep are self-reported daily, and motionlogger watches worn on the wrist provide an objective assessment of sleep. This study is very much in line with the 2016-2020 NIH strategic plan of studying normative populations to detect points for preventive interventions to reduce health disparities. It does so by studying socio-cultural stress profiles that include language brokering experiences, a common phenomenon in low-income Mexican immigrant families that has received little attention to date. We examine the complex conditions under which socio-cultural profiles can function as sources of both risk and protection for adolescents. This project has the potential to uncover processes and practices that can reduce persistent health disparities in Mexican immigrant families. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it focuses on the health outcomes of children of Mexican immigrants, a population with high rates of poverty, low levels of educational attainment, and a high risk for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It also focuses on the developmental period of adolescence, a vulnerable phase of life characterized by social and physical changes, during which behaviors that are predictive of adult health first become established. The results of this project should inform researchers and interventionists about how to support adolescents in Mexican immigrant families, by identifying how a confluence of socio-cultural stressors may function as adaptive or maladaptive, to mitigate the most damaging effects and enhance the payoffs of growing up in a Mexican immigrant family.","Socio-Cultural Stress Profiles, Stress Responses, and Health in Mexican American Adolescents",10023192,R21MD012706,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Language ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Mission ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Parents ', ' Plague ', ' Yersinia pestis disease ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep ', ' Social Environment ', ' social climate ', ' social context ', ' socioenvironment ', ' socioenvironmental ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Wrist ', ' Foreigner ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Mexican ', ' Legal Status ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Academic achievement ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' junior high ', ' middle school ', ' junior high school ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Skin ', ' diabetes risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' virtual ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Trier Social Stress Test ', ' high risk ', ' adolescent health outcomes ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' adolescent health ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' social stressor ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2020,201381,0.08396639638563087
"Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors Project Summary/Abstract Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent and debilitating age-related health condition contributing toward physical and psychosocial decline, reduced quality of life, and rising national expenses. Considerable evidence demonstrates health disparities in the burdens of living with OA. Specifically, African Americans with knee OA experience greater clinical pain, functional limitations, and decreased quality of life compared to non-Hispanic whites. Pain is a key factor contributing to functional limitations and physical disability. Psychosocial stress predicts the onset of chronic pain and living with chronic pain contributes to increased psychosocial stress. Ethnic groups differ in environmental and sociocultural stress exposures. Importantly, the body is designed to adapt and strengthen with adequate recovery in response stress. However, persistent stress can take a toll on the system resulting in dysregulation and dysfunction known as allostatic load. Persistent stress and chronic pain contribute toward altered functioning across multiple biological systems including the brain. Structural and functional changes and accelerated aging in the brain have been observed among individuals with chronic pain, including those with knee OA. Altered stress-related biological functioning has also been indicated in individuals with chronic pain. These biological changes likely contribute to increased morbidity and mortality among those with chronic pain and OA. What is not known however is whether: 1) African Americans and non- Hispanic whites with knee OA differ across biological measures of aging, 2) biological measures of aging are inter-related, and 3) biological measures of aging predict ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. Importantly, there is evidence that health promoting behaviors and psychosocial factors may modulate the biological consequences of OA-related pain and stress. We will investigate a comprehensive array of biopsychosocial measures across three time points in a four year longitudinal analysis of 200 adults with knee OA (100 African Americans and 100 non-Hispanic whites) to determine the influence of stress exposure on measures of biological aging (allostatic load, telomere length, and brain structure/function), and the relationship between biological measures of aging and ethnic group differences in knee OA health outcomes. We will also evaluate the possible modulating effect of risk and resilience factors. Findings will 1) contribute to an improved understanding of the stress, resilience, aging, and health outcome dynamic; 2) promote the identification of biological markers sensitive to stress related exposure and indicative of health- related system functioning; and 3) elucidate resilience factors that may serve as clinical targets to reduce ethnic group disparities in OA and improve overall health outcomes. Project Narrative Osteoarthritis is a prevalent and debilitating age-related condition that unequally burdens African American adults compared to non-Hispanic white adults. There is a gap in knowledge regarding the transition from stress exposure to disparities in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes. The goal of this project is to investigate the trajectory from stress exposure to biological measures of aging and stress-related system dysregulation (allostatic load, telomere length, changes in brain structure/function) to ethnic group differences in osteoarthritis-related health outcomes over a four year period. The long-term intention is to identify strategies to reduce the burden and improve health outcomes for adults with osteoarthritis.","Health Disparities in Osteoarthritis: Biological Aging, Stress, and Pain - Modulation by Resilience Factors",9967926,R01AG054370,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Aging ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Behavior ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Buffers ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cerebrovascular Circulation ', ' brain blood flow ', ' cerebral blood flow ', ' cerebral circulation ', ' cerebrocirculation ', ' cerebrovascular blood flow ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Environment ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exercise ', ' Exhibits ', ' Goals ', ' gray matter ', ' substantia grisea ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Maps ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Structure-Activity Relationship ', ' chemical structure function ', ' structure function relationship ', ' Time ', ' Measures ', ' telomere ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Biological Aging ', ' adaptation behavior ', ' adaptive behavior ', ' Adaptive Behaviors ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' chronic pain ', ' Intention ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Human Figure ', ' Human body ', ' Biological Function ', ' Biological Process ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Exposure to ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' response ', ' social stress ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' Neuraxis ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Length ', ' Dose ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Targeted Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' allostatic load ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' prospective ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biological systems ', ' longitudinal analysis ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' stress symptom ', ' chronic MSK pain ', ' chronic musculoskeletal pain ', ' clinical pain ', ' osteoarthritis associated pain ', ' osteoarthritis pain ', ' protective factors ', ' perceived stress ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,R01,2020,681811,-0.10155775256260328
"The effects of lifetime stress on cognitive aging in the context of HIV-infection: Identifying sources of racial disparities Project Summary  Racial disparities exist in cognitive aging, and it has been established that long-term HIV disease accelerates cognitive aging processes. African Americans (AAs) are a particularly vulnerable group, and our preliminary data indicate that HIV+ AAs demonstrate worse cognitive and brain imaging outcomes than HIV+ EAs even after controlling for confounding factors. We do not know if these disparities persist over time, and the reasons for racial disparities in cognitive outcomes remains unclear. It is well-known that lifetime exposure to stress, which is associated with HIV-infection and AA race, influences cognitive outcomes. Thus, we hypothesize that lifetime stress is a mechanism that places HIV+ AAs at risk for poor cognitive outcomes. Peripheral inflammation has been linked to cognitive impairment in several studies, and is increased in association with HIV, AA race, and lifetime stress. Prospective studies are needed to determine if HIV, lifetime stress exposure and AA race results in premature cognitive aging via increased inflammation. The present study will address this gap in knowledge by examining rates of change in cognitive function and cortical and subcortical brain structures in a cohort of 250 older adults (50+) with and without HIV infection stratified by ethnicity (AA vs. EA). We will also address the gaps in the current stress and disparities literature by using a comprehensive measure of stress and adversity over the lifespan (i.e., Stress and Adversity Inventory [STRAIN]). The STRAIN will allow us to capture stressors that have occurred over an individual's lifetime as well as new stressors during the course of the study. We will examine how recent stress exposure is associated with changes in inflammation and cognitive/brain outcomes. This study is highly significant, as no study to date has examined racial disparities in risk for cognitive declines in HIV-seropositive individuals.  We will use state-of-the art methods for measuring brain changes by following up on a cohort of older (aged 50+) HIV+ and HIV- individuals from a previous NIH supported study. Structural neuroimaging will be used to examine longitudinal changes in morphometry and regional connectivity. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the prospective change in brain/cognitive function in HIV+ and HIV- adults stratified by AA and EA race. Our secondary aim is to determine how lifetime stress differs as a function of HIV status and race. Our third aim will examine how life stress is associated with prospective changes in cognition/brain structure. Finally, we will examine associations between recent life stress and changes in inflammation, and how these changes in inflammation influence cognitive/brain outcomes. This project brings together the skills of several research groups at UCLA, and builds upon existing collaborations and resources. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study to evaluate cognitive aging in a large cohort of HIV+ and HIV- AA and EA older adults. At the end of this study we expect to discern the relative contributions of AA and HIV-specific processes as these unfold via inflammatory processes that increase vulnerability to premature aging. Project Narrative  Racial disparities exist in the context of HIV-infection; of particular importance is HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder. African Americans (with and without HIV) are more likely than European Americans to demonstrate poor cognitive outcomes, but the reasons are unclear. This novel project integrates methods of neuroscience and immunology to determine whether HIV-infection and African American race confer risks for cognitive impairments, and whether poor cognitive outcomes result from stress exposure and inflammation.",The effects of lifetime stress on cognitive aging in the context of HIV-infection: Identifying sources of racial

"A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents PROJECT SUMMARY The overarching goal of this study is to determine how different trajectories of minority stress experienced throughout adolescence may predict behavioral health outcomes for SMA. Relying on methods established and tested in our preliminary work, we will recruit a national sample of diverse SMA (e.g., race and ethnicity, gender, urban vs. rural; N = 1,500) through both social media and respondent-driven sampling strategies in the first year of the project. We will follow participants for three years, incorporating the fundamental tenets of developmental psychopathology, which suggest that examining risk and protective factors for adolescents necessitates longitudinal exploration across critical stages of development. Guiding the proposal are three specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the individual and group trajectories of minority stress over time by following a national sample of SMA (N = 1,500) for 3 years. WH1: There will be differences in minority stress across adolescent development. Aim 2: Determine whether trajectories of minority stress are associated with differences in behavioral health outcomes over time. WH2.1: Trajectories of minority stress and behavioral health outcomes will be associated over time. WH2.2: Reporting higher levels of minority stress in early adolescence will be associated with poorer behavioral health outcomes in later adolescence. Aim 3: Determine whether the association between minority stress and behavioral health over time is different based on sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., urbanicity, gender, race and ethnicity). WH3: There will be significant differences in outcome trajectories by demographic subgroup. WH4: Trajectories of minority stress will be inversely associated with protective factors over time and will differ by demographic subgroup. To test our hypotheses, we propose cutting-edge longitudinal quantitative methodology including latent growth-curve modeling, which are rarely used to examine longitudinal risk among SMAs. The proposed research will be the first to determine how minority stress may influence health across adolescence, and this information can be used directly to inform clinical assessment and the development of targeted behavioral health interventions for this high-need population. Project Narrative Sexual minority adolescents (SMA; adolescents who report a same-sex sexual orientation) are at much higher risk for behavioral health concerns than their heterosexual peers, yet little is known about how different patterns of gay-related stress over time impacts mental/behavioral health outcomes. The proposed research is to examine the individual and group trajectories of sexual minority adolescents (ages 14 to 17 at baseline) and examine how differences in these trajectories predict behavioral health outcomes. The resulting knowledge can be used to inform clinical assessment and the development of effective targeted behavioral health interventions to reduce the behavioral health disparities found in this high need population.",A longitudinal investigation of minority stress in a diverse national sample of sexual minority adolescents,10211027,R01MD012252,"['Academy ', ' Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Hybrids ', ' Incidence ', ' knowledge of results ', ' Literature ', ' Medicine ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychopathology ', ' abnormal psychology ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' Bi-sexual ', ' Bisexual ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Measurement ', ' Gays ', ' Lesbian ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' Nature ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Pattern ', ' Marshal ', ' experience ', ' heuristics ', ' life history ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Adolescent Development ', ' behavioral health ', ' theories ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' depression and suicidality ', ' Depression and Suicide ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' high risk ', ' early adolescence ', ' sexual minority ', ' Homophobic ', ' Homophobia ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' Same-sex ', ' social media ', ' recruit ', ' protective factors ', ' sex risk behavior ', ' sexual risk behavior ', ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R01,2020,206139,0.07466901078672034
"The Study on Type-2 Diabetes and the Rural Experience regarding Stress and Self-management behaviors (STRESS) Project PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevalence is 17% higher in rural areas than in urban areas. Additionally, T2D is ranked as the third most important rural public health priority, according to the Rural Healthy People 2020 report. Rural populations are disproportionately affected by preventable chronic diseases exacerbated by social contextual factors such as poverty, geographic isolation, and persistent exposure to stressors in daily living. Together, these factors may have a negative impact on T2D self-management (T2D-SM) behaviors. Stress is a particularly compelling area of study in light of strong evidence demonstrating its linkages to chronic diseases and metabolic syndrome such as hypertension and obesity. The central hypothesis of this proposed study is that stress influences T2D SM behaviors. The rationale for the proposed research is that psychobiological measures provide compelling data linking poverty, chronic stress, and discrimination to poor T2D outcomes. This study will employ a data triangulation approach through which biological assays for stress will be combined with experiential stress survey data to access the intersections and interactions between stress and T2D SM behaviors among rAAs. The study builds upon a robust infrastructure from community-engaged research in the Brazos Valley region of Texas to explore the inclusion of biological assays for stress (e.g., salivary cortisol) among rAAs with T2D. The two specific aims that guide this research proposal are: 1) determine the relationship between selected psychobiological markers of stress, psychosocial stress, and T2D SM behaviors and among rAAs with T2D; and 2) to determine the extent to which different forms of psychosocial stress (i.e., general versus domain-specific) contribute to differences in T2D SM behaviors among rAAs with T2D. The study will recruit 200 rAAs, who have been diagnosed with T2D to determine which stressors are important risk factors for self-management behaviors. For Aim 1, The study will examine the association between salivary cortisol, self-reported stressors, and T2D-SM behaviors. For Aim 2, The study will analyze the relationship of subjective self-reported measures of stress, health status, and psychosocial factors to the level of adherence to effective T2D SM behaviors. The research proposed is innovative, in the applicants’ opinion, because it addresses an important public health problem (discrimination and other chronic stressors ) in a population (i.e., AAs) largely ignored within the contexts of rurality and disease self- management. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to provide strong evidence of the effect of psychosocial and physiological stressors on T2D-SM behaviors. The results of this research project can offer considerable contributions to the public health field because it has the potential to shed new light on the health of rural African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because it represents an innovative approach for understanding the complex relationship between stress and behavioral modification (e.g., self-management) for type-2 diabetes among rural African Americans. Once the stressors have been identified, we can see the potential for significant advancement in the development of type-2 diabetes self-management programs for rural minority communities. Thus, the proposed research is relevant in part because it embodies the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases’ dual mission: to reduce health disparities and to increase

"Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer Project Summary/Abstract Title: Molecular Determinants of Social Factors in Prostate Cancer  Prostate cancer disproportionately affects African American (AA) men with higher incidence, mortality and aggressive disease. Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress such as neighborhood factors are widely regarded as the foremost driver of such health disparities however their association and translation to biological stress and mechanisms on pathogenesis are poorly understood. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) modulates stress response and has been suggested to mediate social stress induced effects on cellular physiology racial disparities in cancer outcomes. HPA-axis modulates cortisol levels controlling the glucocorticoid (GC) response following a social stress. In addition to cortisol, Leptin levels have been also demonstrated as effectors of stress response. Such stress hormones can modulate cancel cell signaling affecting pathogenesis and outcomes. MicroRNAs are epigenetic elements that are highly stable noncoding small 21-23nt gene- regulatory RNAs acting primarily by targeting 3’UTRs; their roles have been studied in cancer cell survival, proliferation, and metastasis as well as biomarkers of resistance and aggressive PCa. We have recently identified racially distinct differentially expressed miRNAs in PCa tissues and body fluids (serum and urine) as potential biomarker. Both Glucocorticoid and leptin signaling have been shown to affect the expression of miRNAs in human and laboratory models. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesize that social and neighborhood factors translate into continuous biological stress perturbing the levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and leptin resulting in alteration of epigenetic machinery including expression of miRNAs. The proposal will analyze circulating microRNAs and stress hormone levels in African American (AA) prostate cancer patients of the Washington DC metro area with differential socioeconomic status and social stress. Next, we will study the interplay between stress hormones and selected microRNAs in modulating cancer hallmarks. Finally, we will study miRNA-targets-stress markers by identifying miRNA targets and pathways involved to mechanistically characterize selected miRNAs for pathways modulated during social stress. This study will bridge the gap between social factors and biological determinants by studying logical epigenetic mechanisms modulated by social stress and causing health disparities. Understanding these biological implications of social stress will significantly impact diagnosis, prognosis and treatment development for aggressive PCa in African Americans.

"Mental Stress and Myocardial Ischemia after MI: Sex Differences, Mechanisms and Prognosis Young women with a myocardial infarction (MI) have emerged as a group in need of special study, as they have higher mortality compared with men of similar age despite less severe disease. These disparities remain unexplained and suggest sex differences in the pathophysiology, risk factors and prognostic factors of acute MI. The psychosocial sphere is a largely neglected area for the prevention of ischemic heart disease in women. In the previous funding period (R01 HL109413) we assembled a cohort of early-onset (≤60 years of age) post-MI patients, 50% women, and sex- and age-matched community controls—the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress (MIMS)2 study. We used a laboratory protocol to study mental stress-induced myocardial ischemia (MSI), a marker of stress vulnerability and significant prognostic factor in people with coronary artery disease. We found that young women with MI have twice the rate of MSI than men of similar age. We also found that the mechanisms of MSI differ by sex. While in men MSI is primarily due to supply-demand mismatch, in women it is driven by microvascular vasoconstriction. Despite significant progress in our previous funding period, many questions still remain. First, the clinical implications of MSI in women are unknown, since former studies have mostly examined men. Second, the pathways through which MSI contributes to adverse events are unclear. Based on our data, processes involving vascular and immune function could be especially important for women, but this has never been tested. Third, the underlying mechanisms for the higher rate of MSI in young women are unclear. In addition to differences in physiology, MSI could reflect differences in enduring daily life stressors and/or affect/emotions. Building on this previous work, the goal of this competitive renewal is to clarify sex differences in pathways of risk linking emotional stress to MSI and clinical outcomes in young post-MI patients. Within 8 months of MI, 300 new patients younger than 61 years, 50% women, will be tested in the lab for MSI using our established protocol with myocardial perfusion imaging with the same modalities as MIMS2. Subjects will be monitored at home for 1 week, and then followed for clinical events. The proposed sample (MIMS3) will augment our existing cohort (MIMS2), doubling its size to 600 patients so as to make it suitable for the assessment of clinical outcomes. The specific aims are: 1) Examine whether MSI is related to clinical outcomes in both women and men (a composite endpoint of recurrent MI, unstable angina, heart failure hospitalization and cardiovascular death). 2) Examine whether vascular responses to mental stress are related to the clinical endpoint, including endothelium-dependent and microvascular function, and peripheral vasoconstriction; in an exploratory fashion, we will also examine markers of autonomic dysregulation, inflammation, myocardial injury and repair in response to mental stress. 3) Examine sex differences in stressful events and autonomic function during daily life and their relation with MSI during one week of home monitoring. PROJECT NARRATIVE Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the primary cause of death in American women and yet, many questions remain about the unique characteristics of this disease in women. Younger women with CHD remain understudied and our research suggests that they may be especially vulnerable to the effects of psychological stress. Building on our previous work, this competing renewal application will clarify sex differences in pathways of risk linking emotional stress to myocardial ischemia and clinical outcomes in young patients with a myocardial infarction, and will provide critical information relevant to the pathophysiology and prevention of CHD in women.","Mental Stress and Myocardial Ischemia after MI: Sex Differences, Mechanisms and Prognosis",9994772,R01HL109413,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Unstable angina ', ' Angina at Rest ', ' Preinfarction Angina ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Emotions ', ' Endothelium ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Goals ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' hemodynamics ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Inflammation ', ' Laboratories ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Prognosis ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Sleep disturbances ', ' aberrant sleep ', ' disrupted sleep ', ' disturbed sleep ', ' impaired sleep ', ' poor sleep ', ' sleep disruption ', ' Standardization ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Stressful Event ', ' Testing ', ' Troponin ', ' vasoconstriction ', ' vascular constriction ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' Emotional Stress ', ' Ischemic Heart ', ' Ischemic Heart Disease ', ' Ischemic myocardium ', ' cardiac ischemia ', ' coronary ischemia ', ' heart ischemia ', ' myocardial ischemia/hypoxia ', ' myocardium ischemia ', ' Myocardial Ischemia ', ' Acute myocardial infarct ', ' Acute myocardial infarction ', ' base ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' repair ', ' repaired ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Funding ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Physiopathology ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Life ', ' Myocardial perfusion ', ' Immunes ', ' Immune ', ' Severities ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Prevention ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Adverse Experience ', ' Adverse event ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' heart disorder prevention ', ' heart disease prevention ', ' Symptoms ', ' Age-Years ', ' Data ', ' General Prognostic Factor ', ' Prognostic/Survival Factor ', ' Prognostic Factor ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Monitor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' early onset ', ' injury and repair ', ' reconstruction ', ' neglect ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' older women ', ' clinical significance ', ' clinically significant ', ' adolescent woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' young woman ', ' perfusion imaging ', ' early adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' early life adversity ', ' Differences between sexes ', ' Differs between sexes ', ' Sexual differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' Sex Differences ', ' post-traumatic stress symptoms ', ' posttraumatic stress symptoms ', ' posttraumatic symptoms ', ' post-traumatic symptoms ', ' injury to the myocardium ', ' myocardial injury ', ' endothelial progenitor cell ', ' endothelial stem cell  ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,775696,0.07896874508590201
"Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women Project Summary Significance: Compared to heterosexual women, lesbian/gay and bisexual (LGB) women report higher rates of physical health problems. Current evidence, which is largely based on self-report, suggests that important health disparities exist in conditions with high rates of morbidity and mortality (e.g., diabetes, heart disease). To date, however, no study has tested differences in objective measures of health risks between LGB and heterosexual women in a representative sample of young adults. We aim to fill this gap by examining putative health disparities using rigorous objective biomarkers of health (i.e. cardiometabolic functioning and inflammation) in young adulthood in a representative, racially diverse sample of young women who are participating in an ongoing longitudinal study, the Pittsburgh Girls Study (PGS) (Aim 1). We will link prospectively gathered data on discrimination stress and childhood adversity to determine the role of stress exposure in the association between sexual minority status and early adult health (Aim 2). Finally, we will test whether health promotion during adolescence attenuates the association between discrimination stress and health risks among LGB women (Aim 3). Approach: Our plan is to leverage comprehensive, prospectively collected data from the PGS and measure current health indicators among LGB women in the PGS (n=230) and a demographic frequency matched sample of heterosexual women (n=230) in early adulthood (ages 22-25 years). Assessments of health will include: waist circumference, blood pressure, lipids, cholesterol, fatty acids, glucose, insulin, proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6; TNF-α), and C-reactive protein. We propose to assess discrimination stress via cortisol and heart rate reactivity to a lab- based discrimination stressor and perceived discrimination experiences measured annually and prospectively from ages 15 to 21 years. Childhood adversity (family stress, trauma, abuse, and peer victimization) has been assessed annually for in the PGS from youth and caregiver reports. Physical and emotional health promotion during adolescence has been assessed in a number of ways in the PGS including vaccine uptake, safe sexual practices, and physical activity, supportive adult presence, and will be complemented by interviews on school climate and coming out experiences. Investigators: Dr. Kathryn Keenan is the Principal Investigator, Drs. Alison Hipwell, Stephanie Stepp, Karen Matthews, Alicia Matthews and Alida Bouris are Co-Investigators, and Ms. Kristen Wroblewski is the biostatistician. Dr. Constance Hammen is the consultant. The investigators have led many successful NIH-funded studies and represent expertise in developmental psychopathology, women's mental health, sexual minority physical and mental health, health psychology, and biostatistics. Collectively, the investigators have experience in administering the TSST to vulnerable populations, measuring cortisol reactivity, and testing hypotheses involving cardiometabolic and inflammatory functioning. Environment: This proposal builds on long-standing, productive collaborations among investigators at the Universities of Chicago, Illinois, and Pittsburgh. Innovation/Impact: The proposed study provides an unprecedented opportunity to explore health disparities in LGB women in a rigorous manner, examine potential mechanisms by which sexual orientation confers health risks, and identify protective factors in a representative and racially diverse sample of LGB and heterosexual women. Project Narrative The goals of the proposed study are to test whether LGB women differ significantly from heterosexual women on objective biomarkers of health and identify mechanisms by which sexual minority women are at heightened risk for compromised health. It is hypothesized that discrimination stress and childhood stressors have adverse effects on metabolic, inflammatory, and cardiovascular systems that maintain health. The proposal also aims to identify health promotion behaviors that mitigate these associations to inform tailored preventive and intervention approaches for at-risk women.",Examining biomarkers and mechanisms of health disparities in sexual minority women,9922364,R01HL137246,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Chicago ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Illinois ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Humulin R ', ' Novolin R ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Lipids ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Morbidity -

"Epigenetic Mediation of Adverse Social Context on Stress Response, Socioemotional Development, and Health in a Population-based Study of Minority and Low SES Children and Adolescents Project Abstract Pronounced disparities exist by race, ethnicity, and SES in children and adolescents across a range of health conditions, and many adult health disparities can be traced to childhood social contextual inequalities. Epigenetics—modifications to the genome that are not changes in nucleotide sequence—holds great promise as potential indicators of contextual effects and health condition, potentially uncovering health disparities long before they are normally observable. Building on an existing representative study of children, this proposal will directly respond to PAR-16-355 by: 1) assembling epigenome-wide data on 2,000 children at two points in time, 2) describing methylation patterns in 3 race/ethnic groups and across SES levels, and 3) explicating epigenetic associations with social adversity, biological processes, and socioemotional development. The overarching hypothesis is that DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, DHEA levels) and stress responsive behaviors (behavioral problems, risk taking, and resilience). We further hypothesize both differential exposure and differential response to adversity by race/ethnicity and SES explains some of the disparity in stress response and socioemotional development—thereby requiring formal comparisons of race/ethnicity and SES in the same study. To conduct this research we utilize the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS): a 20-city nationally and city representative sample of 4898 children born in 1998- 2000. FFCW provides a uniquely high prevalence of non-Hispanic Black (47%), Hispanic (27%), and impoverished families, making the data particularly useful for studying race/ethnic and SES differences. Families were interviewed at birth and at ages 1, 3, 5, 9, and 15—with biological data collected at ages 9 and 15. The expected results will be to provide estimates of: 1) population-based epigenome-wide DNA methylation measures for 3 race/ethnic groups (Hispanic n=600, African ancestry n=980, European ancestry n=420) in childhood and adolescence, 2) associations of social adversity across development (from in utero to age 15) with DNA methylation, 3) associations between DNA methylation and biological measures of stress response (i.e. telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, and DHEA levels), 4) associations between development of stress response behaviors and methylation profiles, and 5) comparisons of all these relationships in 3 race/ethnic groups and across a wide range of SES.  Project Narrative This proposal examines if DNA methylation partially mediates the effect of adverse social context (i.e. poverty, harsh parenting, neighborhood disorganization, family instability, and parental incarceration) on biological processes related to stress response (telomere length and attrition, cortisol response, DHEA levels) and stress responsive behaviors (behavioral problems, risk taking, and resilience). ","Epigenetic Mediation of Adverse Social Context on Stress Response,

"SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hispanic immigrants to the U.S. are more likely to experience negative health outcomes the longer they live in the U.S. For example, over time Hispanic immigrants engage in riskier behaviors such as substance abuse, violence, and risky sex, and experience more depressive symptoms. The stress associated with the acculturation process, acculturation stress, and resilience at the individual, family, community, and societal levels appear to play important roles in influencing risks. However, little is known about the causal mechanisms linking acculturation stress, resilience, and health outcomes among Hispanic immigrants. Further, little is known about what precise types of stressors (e.g., occupational stress vs. discrimination) and resilience factors (e.g., individual coping vs. family support) have the most important influence on health trajectories of Hispanic immigrants. The proposed longitudinal study (N = 385) will investigate the effects of acculturation stress and resilience on co-occurring substance abuse, intimate partner violence, HIV risk, and depression (i.e., syndemic conditions) and biological stress among young adult Hispanic immigrants in the U.S. More specifically, the proposed project aims to: 1) test theoretical links between the cumulative impact of acculturation stress and resilience on syndemic conditions and biological stress among recent young adult Hispanic immigrants over a two-year period, and 2) identify the specific types of acculturation stressors and resilience factors at the individual, family, community, and societal levels that are most important in predicting syndemic conditions and biological stress among this population over time. Young adult low-income Hispanic immigrant men and women within the first 10 years of immigration will be followed for two years. Biopsychosocial data will be collected from participants at baseline, and then 6 months (FU1), 12 months (FU2), 18 months (FU3), and 24 months later (FU4). Culturally specific measures of acculturation stress and resilience will be used to assess for individual, family, community, and societal risk and protective factors for syndemic conditions. Blood and urine samples will be obtained from participants to measure systemic inflammation (IL 6, IL8, and IL 18) and oxidative stress (F2 isoprostanes), previously validated biomarkers for psychological stress. Various descriptive, univariate and multivariate statistics, including latent growth curve modeling, will be used to address aims 1-2. The findings from this study have the potential to identify risk and protective factors for the decay in heath among Hispanic immigrants. A precise and culturally informed understanding of these phenomena is foundational for designing interventions that can ultimately promote the health and wellbeing of Hispanic immigrants, the largest immigrant group in the U.S. This study also has the potential to lay the theoretical foundation for biopsychosocial health disparities research in other populations. RELEVANCE STATEMENT This study seeks to describe the impact that acculturation stress and resilience plays in influencing behavioral, psychological, and biological health among young adult Hispanics who are recent immigrants. The findings from this study can inform interventions aiming to improve the health and well-being of Hispanic immigrants.","SER Hispano: Salud/Health, Estres/Stress, and Resiliencia/Resilience Among Young Adult Hispanics Immigrants in the U.S.",9921217,R01MD012249,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Buffers ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Immigration ', ' Inflammation ', ' Influentials ', ' Language ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Play ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' statistics ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Violence ', ' violent ', ' violent behavior ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Immigrant ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Occupational ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Reporting ', ' abuse of substances ', ' substance abuse ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' HIV risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' response ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' high risk sex activity ', ' high risk sex behavior ', ' high risk sexual activity ', ' risky sexual behavior ', ' high risk sexual behavior ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Low income ', ' 3-10C ', ' AMCF-I ', ' CXCL8 ', ' GCP1 ', ' IL-8 ', ' IL8 ', ' K60 ', ' SCYB8 ', ' TSG-1 ', ' b-ENAP ', ' IL8 gene ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' intimate partner violence ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' stress resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' migration ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' family support ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' protective factors ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,717861,0.10393957536364046
"Testing cortisol dysregulation as a mediator between early stress and adolescent cardiovascular health PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Psychosocial stress in early childhood has been linked to poorer cardiovascular health, with behavioral and biological alterations as potential mechanisms. One proposed mechanism between early stress and poorer cardiovascular health later in life is dysregulation in cortisol, a hormone that mediates stress responses and regulates metabolism. Cortisol dysregulation can include heightened or blunted cortisol levels, as both have been associated with chronic stress and poor health. A second proposed mechanism is alterations in diet and eating behaviors following early psychosocial stress as acute and chronic stress have been associated with obesogenic diet and eating behaviors. It is currently unknown whether cortisol dysregulation and altered diet and eating behaviors mediate the association between early psychosocial stress and poorer cardiovascular health in adolescence. The goal of this project is to understand whether cortisol dysregulation and altered diet and eating behaviors are pathways between early childhood stress and poorer cardiovascular health in adolescence. This work will identify targets for interventions to promote ideal cardiovascular health in populations who have experienced early stress. This goal will be accomplished using two complementary cohorts: new data collected on 100 diverse adolescents oversampled for high psychosocial risk and existing data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC; N=9,600). These cohorts will be used to address two aims. Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that cortisol dysregulation mediates the association between psychosocial stress in early childhood and 1a) adolescent obesity, blood pressure, and serum markers of inflammation and poor cardiovascular health, and 1b) adolescent obesogenic dietary patterns and eating behaviors. Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that childhood obesogenic dietary patterns and eating behaviors mediates the association between psychosocial stress in early childhood and 2a) adolescent obesity, blood pressure, and serum markers of inflammation and poor cardiovascular health, and 2b) adolescent obesogenic dietary patterns and eating behaviors. I am a developmental psychologist with expertise in childhood psychosocial stress and cortisol regulation. This award will enable me to extend my expertise to assessing and improving cardiovascular health in adolescents. To conduct this research, I will complete a training plan based at the University of Denver under the primary mentorship of Dr. Elysia Davis. I will obtain training and content knowledge in the following areas: 1) cardiovascular health and gold-standard approaches for measurement of obesity, blood pressure, and serum markers of cardiovascular health; 2) diet and eating behavior assessment; 3) advanced statistics; and 4) conducting interventions. The research and training in this proposal will help me launch an independent career investigating pathways from early stress to cardiovascular health. PROJECT NARRATIVE Mounting evidence indicates individuals who experienced chronic psychosocial stress in childhood are less likely to have ideal cardiovascular health in adolescence and adulthood. The proposed research investigates whether cortisol dysregulation and obesogenic diet and eating behaviors following childhood stress are pathways to poorer cardiovascular health in adolescence. A better understanding of pathways from early stress to poorer cardiovascular health has the potential to inform interventions for those who experienced chronic stress in childhood.",Testing cortisol

"The SPARC App:  A Smartphone Application for the Management of Sarcoidosis-Associated Fatigue Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous inflammatory disease that disproportionately affects African Americans in the United States. Sarcoidosis associated fatigue (SAF) is reported by 80% of sarcoidosis patients (SPs) and is considered the most important predictor of quality of life (QoL) due to its negative effects on physical and psychological health. SPs experience significant stress, which has a strong association with increased fatigue and low quality of life. Mobile health technology-based (mHealth) stress management techniques including breathing awareness meditation (BAM) have been shown to reduce stress and fatigue and improve QoL in other chronic diseases. Besides our proof of concept trial, there have been no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating theory driven, tailored mHealth applications addressing SAF. In response to PA-18-389, the proposed R21will refine and test the Sarcoidosis Patient Assessment and Resource Companion (SPARC) app. SPARC includes multi-level components: 1) immediate physiological feedback of heart rate changes during BAM sessions, 2) objective indicator of BAM adherence via timestamp of heart rate data ,3) tailored text message delivered motivational feedback and reinforcement guided by self-determination theory and based upon adherence to daily BAM sessions, 4) healthcare provider & tech service phone access links and 5) automated summary reports to providers. The aims are as follows: Aim 1: Develop and refine the SPARC App to assist SPs in coping with stress & SAF using BAM via further adaptation of Tension Tamer app (HL114957) using focus groups and post refinement lab based usability evaluations. Aim 2: Conduct a 12 week, 2-arm (SPARC vs. enhanced Standard Care) feasibility RCT in 50 SPs with SAF. Evaluations will occur at baseline, weeks 4 &12 and a post-trial follow-up at week 24. 2a: Primary outcomes of feasibility benchmarks: ≥ 80% recruitment, ≥80 % retention rates & usability; ≥.70 adherence to twice daily BAM sessions; ≥ 75 % of sample will score above average on usability & satisfaction questionnaires (SUS >68, uMARS >64& TSUQ >60). 2b: Secondary outcomes of changes in SAF, self-efficacy, stress, autonomous motivation, and QoL. Aim 3: Conduct focus groups after the SPARC trial with providers and staff (n=6-8) and with a random sample of SPARC users (n=12) to assess key user reactions including perceived acceptability, usability, salience, and identify sustainability facilitators/barriers. Triangulate data from AIMS 2 & 3 to further refine and optimize SPARC and prepare for a full-scale efficacy RCT. Long-term objective is to develop practical, effective and sustainable mHealth program for SAF. Dissemination of the SPARC App will help ameliorate the burden of SAF, decrease healthcare disparities, and improve QoL in SPs. PROJECT NARRATIVE Fatigue is a pervasive and disabling symptom in sarcoidosis with limited treatment options.

"Understanding the impact of stress reactivity on racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive function. ABSTRACT  Racial/ethnic minority adults are at higher risk for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Moreover, minority adults are not only exposed to more stressful situations in their daily lives but they also have fewer resources to manage these situations in healthy ways. Limited resources among these adults may lead to impaired physiologic stress responses (i.e., stress reactivity), specifically chronic activation of the physiologic stress response systems, including the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic- pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Our understanding of the impact of stress reactivity on ADRD risk comes from animal studies and experiments in humans using controlled, laboratory stressors. This is a major limitation because laboratory stressors cannot capture the variety, severity, or duration of stressors that individuals face in their daily lives. Thus, there remains a need to more rigorously evaluate relationships of stress reactivity with ADRD risk in natural settings. We propose to fill this critical gap in the literature by adding personalized (person-level) indicators of stress reactivity and rigorous measures of cognitive function to our NIA-funded ecological momentary assessment (EMA) study of 510 Chicago area Latinx, African-American, and White adults aged 40-64 years (R01AG062180). We will leverage planned EMA measurements of stressful experiences and negative affect (emotions) by adding continuous ECG monitoring and by measuring cognitive function and gait speed, which has been shown to precede and predict onset of cognitive impairment, in a subset of 350 participants. We will use data collected over a 14-day study period to develop personalized measures of autonomic and affective stress reactivity. We will then examine whether these personalized measures of stress reactivity are associated with cognitive function and gait speed. Finally, we will test whether racial/ethnic differences in cognitive function are mediated by differences in autonomic and affective stress reactivity. Recommendation 3, Priority 2 of the 2019 ADRD Summit Draft Recommendations is to test mechanistic pathways that may account for AD/ADRD disparities including psychosocial factors like stress. Thus, our proposed study in a multi-ethnic sample will lay the foundation for a research program focused on elucidating the contributions of stress reactivity to disparities in ADRD risk. Our findings will also provide key insights into the most salient targets for stress management interventions designed to prevent ADRD. Project Narrative Greater exposure to stressful situations, coupled with limited access to the financial and social resources needed to manage stress in healthy ways are believed to contribute to persistent racial/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Our overall goal is to generate personalized measures of how people respond to stressful experiences in their daily lives and relate these measures to cognitive function and gait speed. Our proposed study in a multi-ethnic sample will lay the foundation for a research program focused on elucidating the contributions of stress reactivity to disparities in ADRD risk.",Understanding the impact of stress reactivity on racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive function.,10071451,R21AG069435,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Animals ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Attention ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Chicago ', ' Cognition ', ' Electrocardiogram ', ' ECG ', ' EKG ', ' Electrocardiography ', ' Emotions ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Foundations ', ' Glucocorticoids ', ' Goals ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypothalamic structure ', ' Hypothalamus ', ' hypothalamic ', ' Incidence ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Literature ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pituitary Gland ', ' Hypophysis ', ' Hypophysis Cerebri ', ' Pituitary ', ' Pituitary Nervous System ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Stress ', ' Sympathetic Nervous System ', ' Testing ', ' hydrocortisone receptor ', ' HCTRPCX ', ' cortisol receptors ', ' hydrocortisone-receptor complex ', ' Amyloid beta-Protein ', ' Alzheimer beta-Protein ', "" Alzheimer's Amyloid beta-Protein "", "" Alzheimer's amyloid "", "" Amyloid Alzheimer's Dementia Amyloid Protein "", ' Amyloid Beta-Peptide ', ' Amyloid Protein A4 ', ' Amyloid β ', ' Amyloid β-Peptide ', ' Amyloid β-Protein ', ' Aβ ', ' a beta peptide ', ' abeta ', ' amyloid beta ', ' amyloid-b protein ', ' beta amyloid fibril ', ' soluble amyloid precursor protein ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Mediating ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Exposure to ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' cognitive function ', ' Severities ', ' System ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' artery stiffening ', ' artery stiffness ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' memory processing ', ' memory process ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' executive control ', ' executive function ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Monitor ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' Amyloid β production ', ' Amyloid β synthesis ', ' Aβ production ', ' Aβ synthesis ', ' abeta production ', ' amyloid beta production ', ' amyloid beta synthesis ', ' Abeta synthesis ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' high risk ', ' heart rate variability ', ' stress reactivity ', ' Ecological momentary assessment ', ' Gait speed ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' risk factor for dementia ', ' risk for dementia ', ' dementia risk ', ' ']",NIA,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R21,2020,452305,0.12457178886077169
"Biopsyochosocial Mechanisms of Lupus Progression in African American Women PROJECT SUMMARY  Systemic lupus erythematous (SLE) is an inflammatory, autoimmune disease that disproportionally burdens African American women with more rapid disease progression and worse outcomes compared to their White counterparts. Increasing evidence suggests racial disparities in SLE progression are due in part to disproportionate exposure to psychosocial stress, as well as qualitatively unique racial minority stressors, which accelerate physiologic deterioration and may undermine shared inflammatory stress-response pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SLE. Routine experiences of psychosocial stress are common in the lives of African American women with SLE and can include stressors inherent with managing a chronic illness, in addition to those stemming from community disadvantage and poverty. African American women also face distinct forms of psychosocial stress, including experiences of racial discrimination and exposure to other race- related stressors. Despite existing evidence, mechanisms for racial disparities in SLE progression are poorly understood. To address these gaps in knowledge among African American women with SLE, this study aims to: (1) examine understudied dimensions of race-related psychosocial stress in relation to disease activity and organ damage; (2) examine the influence of area-level neighborhood characteristics and stressors on rates of SLE progression; and (3) identify trajectories in biomarkers of inflammation relevant to SLE and identify high- risk subgroups. Data for the proposed analyses are from the Black Women's Experiences Living with Lupus (BeWELL) Study, one of the largest and most comprehensive studies on the social epidemiology of SLE. The BeWELL Study represents a rigorous assessment of rich psychosocial factors, validated measures of disease outcomes, and objective inflammatory biomarkers among an innovative population-based sample of African American women with confirmed SLE (n=438) living in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia. The proposed research will leverage the strengths of the BeWELL Study and yield insight into specific pathways that may contribute to the disproportionate rate of SLE progression experienced by African American women. We will investigate the role of novel race-related psychosocial stressors on SLE outcomes, including “secondhand” or vicarious exposure to racist incidents, subtle everyday slights or microaggressions, and anticipation of experiencing racial threats. Multilevel analyses will examine the influence of spatial factors, specifically socioeconomic disadvantage and racial residential segregation on SLE outcomes. Trajectories in inflammation will be identified and explored in relation to sociodemographic, mental and physical health factors. Longitudinal methodological approaches will be utilized to help support causal inference. Training activities throughout the proposed fellowship will develop skill sets and enhance knowledge needed to conduct the intended analyses and prepare for a career in research. Various opportunities for professional development and mentorship from a diverse team of scholars will facilitate this goal. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Racial disparities in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) progression are widening, and SLE complications disproportionally affect African American women.

"Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study ABSTRACT When life stresses are especially intense, chronic, or overwhelming, deleterious health effects can occur, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, disability, depression, low quality of life, and dementia. In this context, resilience can be defined as the ability to maintain a healthy aging trajectory despite adverse conditions of stress. American Indians (AI) have a unique history and ongoing experience of trauma and disparities in environmental and socioeconomic conditions, which amplify daily stresses and contribute to health risks. Despite these adverse circumstances, remarkable resilience has been described in AI populations. Recent work by our group suggests that social support and alignment with Native culture correlate with lower levels of stress, negativity, anger, hostility, depression, mortality, and cardiovascular disease. However, our findings on cultural alignment are limited, and none has yet explored associations of resilience and social support. It remains an open question whether neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) can result from chronic stress, or whether individual psychosocial characteristics such as resilience can mediate such risk. We propose to address these knowledge gaps by efficiently leveraging an existing effort funded by the NHLBI in the Strong Heart Study, a longitudinal cohort of AI adults from 13 tribal communities across the US. The existing contract covers recruitment, consenting, and basic clinical examination of 3,000 eligible participants in 2022-2024; we propose to augment the limited protocol by administering additional psychosocial and neuropsychological instruments on resilience, social support, cultural identity and alignment, and cognition. Our Specific Aims are to: describe associations of individual resilience among AI adults with identity and self-regard, social support, and cultural alignment, by age and sex; evaluate resilience, social support, and cultural features in relation to ADRD; and use machine learning to develop explanatory models of resilience and dementia. Our study has the potential to advance epidemiologic knowledge of modifiable psychosocial conditions in a vulnerable, underserved population, and consequently to offer a clearer picture of the relative contributions of psychosocial, behavioral, interpersonal, and socioeconomic factors related to ADRD. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic stress can result in negative health effects, including inflammation, cardiovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD); American Indian (AI) populations have endured excess stresses and traumas, but have also shown remarkable psychosocial resilience, which may be related to robust social support, community environment, cultural identity. It is unclear which of these psychosocial features may be most predictive of psychosocial resilience in AI adults, or whether any is protective against neurodegeneration and ADRD. A search on NIH Reporter uncovered many projects focused on cognitive reserve—sometimes also called resilience—but none on psychosocial resilience or its related features as protective health characteristics in adult AIs. This project seeks to fill this knowledge gap with novel data collection and analysis on trait-based psychosocial resilience, related features, cognitive function, and ADRD in 3000 adult AIs as part of the ongoing Strong Heart Study.","Resilience, cultural alignment, and social support in brain aging: Data from the Strong Heart Study",10126397,R01AG070822,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Anger ', ' angers ', ' angry ', ' Anthropology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Family ', ' Female ', ' Medical Genetics ', ' Clinical genetics ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hostility ', ' Inflammation ', ' male ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nerve Degeneration ', ' Neuron Degeneration ', ' neural degeneration ', ' neurodegeneration ', ' neurodegenerative ', ' neurological degeneration ', ' neuronal degeneration ', ' Neuropsychology ', ' Neuropsychologies ', ' neuropsychologic ', ' Philosophy ', ' Poverty ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' Tribes ', ' Work ', ' Mediating ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Individual ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' Funding ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' Reporter ', ' Navaho ', ' Navajo ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' cognitive loss ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' instrument ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' cognitive function ', ' bully ', ' bullying ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Amentia ', ' Dementia ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' intergenerational ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' cognitive reserve ', ' under served population ', ' underserved people ', ' Underserved Population ', ' tribal community ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Trauma ', ' application in practice ', ' practical application ', ' eligible participant ', ' aged brain ', ' aging brain ', ' Alzheimer risk factor ', ' alzheimer risk ', "" Alzheimer's disease risk "", ' healthy aging ', ' screening ', ' public health intervention ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' recruit ', ' AD related dementia ', ' ADRD ', ' Alzheimer related dementia ', "" Alzheimer's disease related dementia "", ' socio-demographics ', ' sociodemographics ', ' data heterogeneity ', ' data set heterogeneity ', ' dataset heterogeneity ', ' heterogeneous data ', ' heterogeneous data sets ', ' heterogeneous datasets ', ' heterogenous data sets ', ' heterogenous datasets ', ' heterogenous data ', ' clinical exam ', ' clinical examination ', ' ']",NIA,WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,521320,0.027936073853570127
"Measuring Stress in Diverse Gender Minority Adolescents Measuring Stress in Diverse Gender Minority Adolescents Project Summary (30 lines) This study will develop a comprehensive measure of stress for TGA—the Transgender Adolescent Stress Scale (TASS). TGA experience significantly higher risks of many behavioral health outcomes, including anxiety, depression, substance use and suicide. Such disparities are likely related to experiences of gender dysphoria, and separately, minority stress – i.e., prejudice, stigma, and victimization against transgender persons – but existing research has typically focused on adults, and existing measures have sub-optimal psychometric characteristics. Thus, we will develop a comprehensive measure of transgender adolescent stress – which includes subscales for gender dysphoria and minority stress that can be used independently or in concert -- as a means to facilitate improved clinical assessment and intervention development. Toward this end, Aim 1 will utilize a modified Delphi process and data analysis of existing interviews with TGAs to identify and operationalize unique stressors that influence transgender persons during adolescence, including cognitive interviews (n=20) with transgender adolescents. Based on the extensive experience of the team in developing the Sexual Minority Adolescent Stress Inventory (SMASI), these methods will ensure that Aim 1 results in a comprehensive preliminary Transgender Adolescent Stress Scale (TASS) ready for testing. In Aim 2, we will utilize a dual- method social media and respondent driven sampling (RDS) approach to recruit 450 racially and ethnically diverse TGAs. These adolescents will complete the preliminary TASS as well as a series of behavioral health, substance use, and suicidality measures. Data analysis in Aim 2 will focus on assessing reliability and criterion validity of the TASS, as well as convergant/divergent validity of the TASS as compared to existing measures. In each stage, the presence of an expert panel, as well as rigorous methods for recruitment, data cleaning, and analysis, will ensure that the produced TASS is a comprehensive measure ready to be utilized by researchers and clinicians to better understand and address stress experiences among transgender adolescents. Measuring Stress in Diverse Gender Minority Adolescents Project Narrative This proposed study aims to develop a comprehensive measure of stress for TGA—the Transgender Adolescent Stress Scale (TASS). To do this, we will identify and operationalize unique stressors that influence transgender persons during adolescence related to both gender dysphoria and minority stress, utilize rigorous psychometric development to create a set of measures, and examine their relation to behavioral health outcomes. This study has two aims: 1. Develop a preliminary Transgender Adolescent Stress Scale (TASS) through an analysis of life history calendar (LHC) data and a modified Delphi process with an expert panel; 2. Assess reliability and preliminary criterion validity of the TASS in a cross-sectional study of racially and ethnically diverse TGA (N = 450).",Measuring Stress in Diverse Gender Minority Adolescents,10125846,R21MD015945,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Anxiety ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Breast ', ' Communities ', ' critical developmental period ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Hate ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Prejudice ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Puberty ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Schools ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Suicide ', ' fatal attempt ', ' fatal suicide ', ' intent to die ', ' suicidality ', ' Suicide attempt ', ' non fatal attempt ', ' nonfatal attempt ', ' suicidal attempt ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' Echography ', ' Echotomography ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' sonogram ', ' sonography ', ' sound measurement ', ' ultrasound ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Self-Injurious Behavior ', ' Deliberate Self-Harm ', ' deliberate self harm ', ' intentional self harm ', ' intentional self injury ', ' self harm ', ' self injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Ensure ', ' Distress ', ' dysphoria ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Respondent ', ' instrument ', ' Consensus ', ' Life ', ' Victimization ', ' Source ', ' Occupational ', ' psychosocial ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' trans* ', ' transgender ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' life history ', ' austin ', ' peer ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' girls ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' DSM-5 ', ' DSM5 ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition ', ' Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-V ', ' DSM-V ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' device development ', ' instrument development ', ' Device or Instrument Development ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Calendar ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Heterosexuals ', ' Behavioral ', ' neglect ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Clinical assessments ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Impairment ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' stem ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' high risk ', ' sexual minority ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Health ', ' LGBT Health ', ' gender dysphoric ', ' gender dysphoria ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' LGB ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual ', ' gender minority ', ' anxious symptom ', ' anxiety symptoms ', ' social media ', ' cis-gender ', ' cisgender ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' substance misuse ', ' recruit ', ' cognitive interview ', ' data cleansing ', ' data cleaning ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA,R21,2020,234744,0.05537810433834718
"Stress, Vascular Function, and Inflammation as Mechanisms of Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Risk ABSTRACT The purpose of this K01 proposal is to facilitate the applicant's transition to an independent research career focused on stress and sex hormone biology to understand mechanisms of sex differences in cardiovascular disease and potential disparities among women. Training components for the proposed research will include direct clinical training in stress testing and vascular physiology, new training in sex hormones and measures of ovarian function, faculty career development, active mentoring, and completion of the proposed research. The premise of this research project is based on preliminary data from the applicant's own research which suggest that compared to men, women (and particularly, younger women) with coronary heart disease have distinct vascular mechanisms in relation to stress and myocardial ischemia, and have higher basal and stress-related inflammation. We have also reported that women ≤ 60 years of age are more likely to develop myocardial ischemia during mental stress than men of similar age. The underlying explanation for these sex differences is unknown; however, one potential mechanism involves sex hormone biology among premenopausal women and across the menopausal transition. Stress may impair female reproduction through diminished ovarian reserve and induce earlier age at menopause, which have been associated with cardiovascular risk, possibly through sex hormone-related pathways influencing immune response, vascular, and cardiac function. The overall goal of this project is to understand mechanisms for sex differences in inflammatory and vascular responses to mental stress, and the role of ovarian function and menopausal status among women. The applicant will leverage the infrastructure of the Myocardial Infarction and Mental Stress Study 2 (MIMS2: R01HL109413), which was recently renewed for a new enrollment wave (MIMS3: 2R01HL109413). The two waves will total 300 men and 300 women with a recent myocardial infarction (MI), ≤ 60 years of age. The applicant will add the collection of data on anti-Müllerian Hormone (AMH), a biomarker of ovarian reserve and menopausal status in women and examine AMH levels in relation to stress responses. The applicant will also recruit a sample of healthy women (n = 100) matched for age to the post-MI women, for comparison of AMH levels and age at menopause. The scientific aims of this project are to: 1) Examine sex differences in inflammation and vascular function at baseline and in response to mental stress and the role of gonadal aging by comparing young and middle-aged women and men; 2) Examine and compare inflammatory and vascular profiles and gonadal aging and age at menopause with age-matched control women; and 3) Examine whether psychosocial stressors such as depression, early life adversity, discrimination, and neighborhood disadvantage are associated with gonadal aging (lower AMH levels) in women with a recent MI and age matched controls. The new enrollment of patients and controls will provide key opportunities for training and data collection on gonadal aging and vascular function to inform the development of a future NIH-R01 proposal. NARRATIVE The current K01 application seeks to understand the role of gonadal aging on stress physiology, particularly inflammatory and vascular responses, in order to clarify stress-related pathways that may increase vulnerability towards cardiovascular disease in women. Understanding whether sex hormones mediate these stress- related pathways may inform prevention efforts and treatments for women with heart disease to reduce cardiovascular mortality among women.","Stress, Vascular Function, and Inflammation as Mechanisms of Sex Differences in Cardiovascular Risk",10038682,K01HL149982,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Biology ', ' Blood Vessels ', '

"Health disparities, stress pathways, and stress-related comorbidities among MSM living with HIV Project Summary Stress is associated with HIV risk behaviors, immune dysregulation, and among people living with HIV (PLWH) it has been associated with viral load and disease progression. The goal of this study is to better understand the mechanisms of stress and stress-related comorbidities and how they exacerbate HIV-related health disparities among HIV-infected Black men who have sex with men (BMSM). Studies in many parts of the US suggest that BMSM often live or spend much of their time in impoverished neighborhoods where physical and social disorders (e.g., physical decay, violence, discrimination) are clustered. These socio-structural factors can be conceptualized as chronic and acute stressors and may promote other stressors that lead to HIV-related outcomes. While much of the literature on minority stress has focused on major discriminatory events, this proposed study will examine microaggressions. We will comprehensively assess chronic, acute, and daily psychosocial stressors that are particularly relevant to MSM, especially BMSM. Moreover, we will use measures of hypothalamic–pituitary– adrenal (HPA) axis responses, sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and inflammatory biomarkers to identify specific stress pathways among HIV-infected BMSM and White MSM (WMSM) that can be targeted in future interventions. We aim to provide an extension of minority stress theory by utilizing intensive longitudinal protocols to assess daily discriminatory events and other stressors, and to explore the association with HIV-related behaviors and physiological outcomes. Built upon the evidence of feasibility and acceptability from our previous research, this aim will be accomplished by using ecological momentary assessment (EMA) of stressors and stress, Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS), and home-based testing for cortisol. We propose a longitudinal study of 450 HIV-infected BMSM and WMSM who have common stress-related comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, depression, substance abuse) assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Participants will provide 9 days of smartphone- based EMA and MEMS for ART medication adherence every 6 months for 24 months. Every 6 months, we will collect stress and immune function biomarkers. Relevance The proposed research will enhance the effectiveness of future interventions by increasing our understanding of MSM health disparities and which modifiable stressors are most strongly associated with the health of MSM, the context in which these stressors lead to HIV-related behaviors, and how resilience and specific types of social network support may have buffering and direct effects on well-being.","Health disparities, stress pathways, and stress-related comorbidities among MSM living with HIV",9892889,R01MD013495,"['Adrenal Glands ', ' Adrenals ', ' suprarenal gland ', '

"Stress, Epigenetics and Aging Project Summary There is extensive evidence that socioeconomic status (SES) and social stressors shape the development of numerous chronic conditions and aging-related illnesses. However, the processes through which SES and social stress affect biological processes related to aging and disease development have not been fully elucidated, particularly at the cellular level. This is important to investigate among African Americans who have higher mortality, shorter lifespan, and experience a disproportionate burden of disease than whites. Research examining associations between stressors and biological aging processes have been predominately cross- sectional in nature and have included predominately racially and ethnically homogenous samples. No prior studies have assessed the independent and cumulative impact of SES and stress at multiple time points across the life course in relation to biomarkers of aging (e.g. telomere length, DNA methylation age). Furthermore, little is know as to whether behavioral and psychological factors mediate the association between stress and biological aging processes, and whether forms of resilience (e.g., coping response, social support) may modify these associations. We propose to leverage existing data from the Disparities (DISPAR) study to examine the relationship between stressors and resilience across the life course in relation to biological aging processes. The DISPAR study conducted a 50-year follow-up of women who participated in a pregnancy cohort between 1959 and 1957 in Alameda County, California. Subsets of offspring were followed at ages 5 y, 9-11 y, 15-17y, and 50 years. The DISPAR sample includes a representative subsample (n=605) of these children interviewed as adults (mean age of 50 years), 42% African-American and 50% female. Validated measures of negative life events, discrimination, caregiving stress, mental health, social support, and coping mechanisms among others were collected. In addition, anthropometric measures, blood pressure and a blood sample were collected. For this study (N=372), we propose to assay existing stored blood collected at age 50 for biomarkers of biological aging (telomere length, methylation age). We will examine the role of childhood and adult SES and psychosocial stressors (e.g. child adversity, caregiving stress, job stress, racial discrimination) on telomere length and methylation age in adulthood. Additionally, we propose to examine behavioral (e.g. physical activity, smoking) and psychological (e.g. distress) responses to stress as potential mediators of these associations, and positive and negative coping factors as potential modifiers of the associations between SES, stress and biological processes. Given that half of our sample is African-American, we will have the opportunity to assess how stress, resilience-based factors, and associated biological aging processes differ by race. Completion of this project would allow us to elucidate important biological, genetic, and epigenetic pathways that help explain how stress and resilience shapes population health disparities among aging populations. Project Narrative Socioeconomic status (SES) and social stress are increasingly recognized as important factors that shape the development of chronic diseases and aging-related illnesses, particularly among African Americans, who experience a disproportionate burden of disease. However, the pathways through which stress affects obesity the biological pathways related to health disparities are not fully understood, particularly at the cellular level, and most research to date has been cross-sectional and among samples that lack racial diversity. We propose to address these gaps by examining the independent and cumulative impact of both SES and social stress at multiple points across the life course in relation to DNA methylation (e.g. DNA methylation age, genome-wide methylation) and telomere length among a diverse sample of whites and African Americans, as well as forms of resilience and coping in response to these stressors.","Stress, Epigenetics and Aging",9884529,R01AG058704,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect

"Socioeconomic Disparities in Cognitive and Neural Development in the First 3 years Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is associated with deleterious effects on cognitive development and academic achievement, which in turn have long-lasting ramifications for numerous physical and mental health outcomes across the lifespan. Yet, our understanding of the experiential, physiological, epigenetic and neural pathways through which socioeconomic disparities shape developmental processes is just beginning to emerge. The core contribution of the proposed research would be to further this understanding, by marrying state-of-the-art measurement of brain function, physiology and epigenetics with a sophisticated conceptual and empirical understanding of socioeconomic inequality and experience. In this project, we will investigate how distal factors like SES operate through more proximate factors such as the home language environment and perceived and physiologic stress, and how these proximate factors shape the development of distinct neural and cognitive systems. Two pathways are hypothesized. First, we predict that socioeconomic disparities in the quality and quantity of linguistic stimulation in the home lead to differences in the function of language-specific brain processes, which in turn lead to differences in child language development. Secondly, we predict that SES disparities in perceived stress as well as physiologic stress (cortisol, epigenetics) lead to differences in the function of memory-specific brain processes, which in turn lead to differences in child memory development. To test these hypotheses, a longitudinal study is proposed in which a socioeconomically diverse cohort of 200 children and their families will be followed from birth through age 3. The development of early language and memory skills will be tracked, along with family SES, the home language environment, perceived stress, stress physiology, epigenetics, and brain function. The following specific aims are proposed: (1) Examine longitudinally from birth to 3 the relations among SES, language, memory and brain development. (2) Examine whether socioeconomic disparities in cognitive and brain development are mediated by (a) the home language environment and (b) perceived and physiologic stress. This innovative research will elucidate the pathways linking socioeconomic disparities to specific cognitive and neural outcomes. This is aligned with NICHD’s mission to assist children to “achieve their full potential for healthy and productive lives.” Socioeconomic disadvantage in childhood is associated with deleterious effects on cognitive development and academic achievement, which in turn have long-lasting ramifications for numerous physical and mental health outcomes. This research will elucidate how the home language environment, perceived stress, stress physiology, epigenetics and brain function shape these associations, from birth through age three. This information will be critical for the design of more precise preventive, screening and interventional strategies to prevent academic failure and ultimately foster healthy development for all children.",Socioeconomic Disparities in Cognitive and Neural Development in the First 3 years,9973163,R01HD093707,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Language ', ' Electroencephalography ', ' EEG ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Goals ', ' Hair ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Hippocampus ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Language ', ' Language Development ', ' acquiring language skills ', ' language acquisition ', ' language learning ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Memory ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mission ', ' Biological Models ', ' Biologic Models ', ' Model System ', ' Neural Pathways ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Physiology ', ' Poverty ', ' Research ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Distal ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Failure ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Fostering ', ' Measurement ', ' Inequality ', ' event related potential ', ' Event-Related Potentials ', ' Shapes ', ' Investigation ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' American ', ' early experience ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' Neural Development ', ' neurodevelopment ', ' Structure ', ' unborn ', ' prenatal ', ' skills ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Academic achievement ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Developmental Process ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Cognitive ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Preventative screening ', ' Preventive screening ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cognitive neuroscience ', ' Coupled ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cognitive system ', ' Neurocognition ', ' cognitive development ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' Attainment Rate ', ' Graduation Rates ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' early life stress ', ' early adversity ', ' early childhood adversity ', ' early life adversity ', ' perceived stress ', ' ']",NICHD,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY TEACHERS COLLEGE,R01,2020,484560,0.05122155077610686
"Stress and the Genome: Testing the Impact of Social Effects on Gene Regulation Project Summary  The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and well being. Chronic social stress and reduced access to social support are strongly linked to major diseases of aging; as a result, social adversity is highly predictive of life expectancy itself. Recent evidence suggests that, while some of this relationship is explained by correlated factors such as smoking, obesity, and health care access, social stressors also have a direct impact on physiological function. Indeed, work in animal models has clearly demonstrated that the experience of social subordination alone can alter the function of the immune system, in part by altering gene regulation in immune cells.  The goal of the proposed research is to address a key outstanding question that arises from these findings: when, and for whom, are chronic social stress effects on immune function most important? To do so, it will take advantage of dominance rank in female rhesus macaques as a model for chronic social stressor exposure in humans. Rhesus macaque females are excellent models for human social stress because they naturally organize into dominance rank hierarchies in which low ranking individuals experience increased rates of harassment, reduced social affiliation, and physiological markers of rank-related stress. Importantly, dominance rank assignments, and thus an individual's exposure to social stressors, can be manipulated in this species by manipulating group membership. Such manipulations yield a powerful experimental model for investigating the consequences of socially induced stress—an approach that is directly translatable to humans, but that is practically and ethically impossible in humans themselves.  The proposed study will take advantage of this model to investigate how differential exposure to dominance rank-induced social stress causally influences gene expression in the immune system. Specifically, it will use an in vitro approach to efficiently screen for condition-specific social stress effects on gene expression levels across 30 physiologically relevant environmental conditions (e.g., pathogen exposure, steroid hormone signaling). It will complement the in vitro screen with an in vivo test of the gene regulatory and antibody response to influenza vaccination, a medical procedure in which variable responses are of particular concern as individuals age. Finally, it will test whether age, social behavior, and genotype can be used to predict interindividual variation in the strength of social stressor effects on immune regulation, and hence which individuals are most vulnerable. Together, the proposed analyses will provide much-needed insight into the factors that explain when and why individuals differ in their response to the same social stressors, as well as the potential consequences of these differences for medical treatment. The project's results will therefore have direct translational application to both identifying the most susceptible members of our aging population and suggesting tailored strategies for intervention. Project Narrative The social environment has a clear and profound impact on human health and wellbeing, with particularly strong predictive power for diseases of aging and mortality risk itself. This project uses a nonhuman primate model for human social stress, the rhesus macaque, to investigate the factors that explain interindividual variation in the impact of social stress on the genome, including the conditions under which these effects are most important. The results of this project will contribute to understanding how social stress influences disease susceptibility and how to identify those who are most vulnerable to its negative effects.",Stress and

"Understanding Ecologic Stress, Risk and Health Resiliencies in Mexican-Origin Adults Living in a High Poverty Rural Community Project Summary Latino adults have higher age-adjusted rates of many chronic disease relative to overall US trends, while also having health advantages. Exposure to stress contributes to some of these disparities, with implications for diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and mental illness. This project will clarify reported stressors experienced by Mexican-origin adults in a low-income, medically under-served, border community. This community participatory research will: 1) elucidate our knowledge of stress and culturally-bounded protective factors through intensive, ethnographically-grounded interviews (N = 50); and, 2) examine relationships between reported stressors to objective measures of physiological stress, systemic inflammation, and chronic disease risk. The latter will be achieved through a representative household survey of Mexican-descent adults (N = 320). Each of two yearly follow ups will assess biomarkers and self-reports on several factors: valid psychosocial scales (e.g., socially embedded stressors); protective social and culturally-tied factors; and, culturally-relevant coping resources (e.g., perceived individual support available and persons' openness to receive support). Objective health metrics include markers of inflammation and systemic dysregulation (i.e., hsCRP, Il-6; cortisol) and Life's Simple 7 (i.e., A1c; cholesterol; blood pressure; adiposity; smoking; physical activity; diet). Longitudinal models will be used to predict biomarker and chronic disease risk, and test for differential sub-group patterns. Innovative, minimally invasive, and community responsive methods will be used for biomarker data collection--specifically from dried blood spot, immediately available assessments of A1c, BMI and BP, and cortisol from hair. Cortisol in hair and nails reflect more chronic stress indicators than more commonly studied measures, and have particular promise as endpoints in stress management interventions. Cortisol in keratin samples better parallels expected lengths of behavioral intervention trials compared with highly transient levels observed in saliva, serum and urine. Analysis of the cohort data will also directly inform sub-population targeting for a series of focus groups (N = 90). A minimum of 4 groups for each biologically identified sub-populations will be conducted: those for persons of uniform high stress (high reported stress and high biologic stress), those of uniform low stress, and those that appear resilient (high in reported stress but lower than expected biologic stress). The adaptability of a promising stress-management CHW intervention recently tested with Latinos in Connecticut will be explored. Key informant interviews with community stakeholders and a community advisory board leveraged from a five-year prevention research center beginning October of 2019 will further prepare us to submit a clinical trial to reduce and mitigate stressors. Thus the data generated from this study will be invaluable to conducting a prevention trial to reduce stress and chronic disease in our community, and in determining methods and models for other populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will clarify stressors experienced by adults in a low-income, predominantly Mexican-origin border community. Guided by a community based participatory research this project proposes to illuminate stress, Latino protective factors and chronic disease risk. The findings will inform strategies to mitigate stressors and promote Latinos’ health.","Understanding Ecologic Stress, Risk and Health Resiliencies in Mexican-Origin Adults Living in a High Poverty Rural Community",9972389,R01MD014150,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arizona ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Mental disorders ', ' Mental health disorders ', ' Psychiatric Disease ', ' Psychiatric Disorder ', ' mental illness ', ' psychiatric illness ', ' psychological disorder ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community Actions ', ' Connecticut ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Hair ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interview ', ' Keratin ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Methods ', ' Nail plate ', ' Nails ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Saliva ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Target Populations ', ' Testing ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Cohort Analyses ', ' Cohort Analysis ', ' Latino ', ' Rural Community ', ' stress buffering ', ' stress management ', ' ethnographic ', ' Ethnography ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Mexican ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Inflammatory Response ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Cellular Immune Function ', ' immune function ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Length ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' trend ', ' Process ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' resilience ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' trial comparing ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' minimally invasive ', ' population based ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' predictive biomarkers ', ' predictive molecular biomarker ', ' predictive marker ', ' Prevention trial ', ' community center ', ' rural poverty ', ' recruit ', ' stress reduction ', ' protective factors ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R01,2020,612337,0.1499210540957279
"Social Convoys, Cognitive Reserve and Resilience, and Risk for Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias 7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Emerging evidence suggests that sexual and gender minority populations are at increased risk for Alzheimer’s  disease and related dementias (ADRD). This may be due, at least in part, to the cumulative impact of minority  stress;; related social isolation and loneliness;; and barriers to care and support services. Social support, on the  other hand, has emerged as a protective factor in the face of minority stress, and as a predictor of successful  cognitive aging among the general population. However, few studies have assessed the social support networks  of sexual and gender minorities in detail to determine the specific support characteristics that facilitate cognitive  reserve  and  resilience.  The  proposed  study  will  fill  this  gap  by  comparing  the  stress,  social  support  networks,  and aging-­related cognition of a newly recruited sample of sexual and gender minority adults (n = 300, age 25-­ 85) to those of a matched heterosexual, cisgender sample (n = 300) enrolled in an ongoing longitudinal study of  aging and cognitive reserve (the Reference Ability Neural Networks or RANN study). In addition, the proposed  study  will  conduct  secondary  analysis  of  MRI  data  collected  in  RANN  to  explore  differences  in  brain  features  between minority and majority groups, generating hypotheses for future research. The specific aims are: (1) To  compare stress (perceived general stress and minority stress related to one or more marginalized identities) and  cognitive performance across multiple domains in newly recruited sexual / gender minority adults and matched  heterosexual,  cisgender  adults  enrolled  in  the  RANN  study;;  (2)  To  compare  social  network  characteristics  of  sexual  /  gender  minority  adults  to  those  of  matched  heterosexual,  cisgender  adults,  and  examine  within-­  and  between-­group  differences  in  social  support  based  on  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity,  and  age;;  (3)  Across  both identity groups (N = 600), to examine the role of minority stress, social support, resources and wellbeing in  development of cognitive reserve and resilience (i.e., how these assets moderate the effects of minority stress  and  aging  on  health  and  cognitive  functioning);;  and  (4)  In  an  exploratory  analysis,  to  evaluate  differences  between  sexual  /  gender  minority  (n  >  40)  and  matched  heterosexual,  cisgender  RANN  participants  in  MRI-­ measured  brain  features  and  their  relation  to  stress,  social  network  characteristics,  cognitive  functioning,  and  risk  for  incident  ADRD.  We  expect  that  understanding  differences  and  similarities  in  the  social  networks  of  minority  and  majority  adults  and  the  relationship  of  these  characteristics  to  stress  and  aging-­related  cognition  will  enable  us  to  identify  modifiable  factors  associated  with  cognitive  reserve  and  resilience,  informing  future  interventions to prevent cognitive decline and ADRD.      8. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Minority  stress  and  related  health  disparities  may  increase  the  risk  for  Alzheimer’s  Disease  and  Related  Dementias  (ADRD)  among  minority  populations,  while  social  support  has  the  potential  to  be  protective.  This  study  will  examine  the  role  of  minority  stress,  social  network  characteristics,  along  with  other  resources  and  wellbeing,  in  the  development  of  cognitive  reserve  and  resilience.  Findings  will  inform  the  development  and  testing of future, tailored interventions to prevent cognitive decline and ADRD. ","Social Convoys, Cognitive Reserve and Resilience, and

"Socio-Cultural Stress Profiles, Stress Responses, and Health in Mexican American Adolescents This competitive revision application examines ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic disrupts the daily lives of Mexican-origin adolescents who are making the transition to young adulthood. This unique sample of low- income emerging adults from immigrant families are language brokers, who translate and interpret both linguistically and culturally for their English-limited parents. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the socio- cultural stressors and health disparities they face on a daily basis. It is critical to capture how COVID-19 related stressors may potentially alter their health trajectories, as periods of transition (e.g., from high school to young adulthood) and environmental uncertainty (e.g., COVID-19) provide opportunities to examine where in the life course individual differences become apparent and how changes in health trajectories take shape. The three waves of data on adolescents collected from early to late adolescence before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic will be linked to two additional waves of online data collected after the onset of COVID-19. We first examine the impact of COVID-19 stress profiles on health outcomes. We then test how COVID-19 related stress profiles influence stress responses both behaviorally and physiologically to influence health outcomes. Specifically, whether adaptive responses to COVID-19 related stressors provide avenues of resilience in health outcomes, whereas the opposite may be the case for those who experience COVID-19 socio-cultural stressors in maladaptive ways. Further, we propose to test whether the associations from socio-cultural stress profiles to stress responses to health outcomes are exacerbated or mitigated through various moderators. Physiological stress responses will be assessed via cortisol. Through a four-day daily diary study, day-to-day cortisol, sleep, and substance use responses to COVID-19 related stressors will be measured. The original sample of Mexican-origin early adolescents were sampled first as middle schoolers (Wave 1) and again one year later (Wave 2). The goal of the first year of the R21 was to re-sample the same set of adolescents after their transition to high school, in order to test how early adolescent experiences of socio-cultural stressors longitudinally influence stress responses and health outcomes. By March 2020, largely before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., we completed the proposed W3 data collection to reach the stated goals of Year 1 of the R21. In Year 2 of the R21, which starts in the summer of 2020, the adolescents in the study will be making the transition from high school to young adulthood. The supplement will coincide with Year 2 of the R21 grant, a critical juncture for capturing the health trajectories of emerging adults, and an opportune time to lay the foundation for determining the COVID-19 pandemic’s long-term influence on their adult health. This project has the potential to uncover processes and practices that can reduce persistent health disparities in Mexican immigrant families that may result from COVID-19. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed study is relevant to public health because it focuses on a public health crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic’s influence on a vulnerable population of adolescents transitioning from adolescence to young adulthood. These individuals are especially at risk for health disparities, as they come from Mexican immigrant families, a population with high rates of poverty, low levels of educational attainment, and a high risk for negative psychosocial and physical health outcomes. The results of this project should inform researchers and interventionists about how to support emerging adults from Mexican immigrant families in the face of future pandemics or crises, by identifying how certain individuals are able face COVID-19 related stressors in adaptive or maladaptive ways, to mitigate the most damaging effects and enhance the payoffs of growing up in a Mexican immigrant family.","Socio-Cultural Stress Profiles, Stress Responses, and Health in Mexican American Adolescents",10246683,R21MD012706,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Data Collection ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Educational Status ', ' Educational Achievement ', ' educational level ', ' training achievement ', ' training level ', ' training status ', ' Emergency Situation ', ' Emergencies ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Cetacort ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cortef ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortril ', ' Dermacort ', ' Eldecort ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Hytone ', ' Nutracort ', ' Proctocort ', ' Infection ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Language ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanas ', ' Chicanos ', ' Occupations ', ' Jobs ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Parents ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Wages ', ' Salaries ', ' Sampling Studies ', ' Sleep ', ' Stress ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress response ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' base ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' race discrimination ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' AOD use ', ' substance use ', ' substance using ', ' using substances ', ' Alcohol or Other Drugs use ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Mexican ', ' Immigrant ', ' Shapes ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Pattern ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Negotiating ', ' Negotiation ', ' Mediation ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' underclass ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' junior high ', ' middle school ', ' junior high school ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Legal ', ' Low income ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' pandemic ', ' pandemic disease ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Individual Differences ', ' high risk ', ' early adulthood ', ' emerging adult ', ' traumatic event ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' COVID19 ', ' corona virus disease 2019 ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 ', ' COVID-19 ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' COVID-19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 epidemic ', ' COVID19 pandemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' corona virus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 epidemic ', ' coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ', ' COVID-19 pandemic ', ' ']",NIMHD,"UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN",R21,2020,195626,0.03977380109518542
