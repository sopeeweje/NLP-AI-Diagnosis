"Treatment of Chronic Pain - Consumer and Provider Conce* DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Studies have shown that most chronic pain is managed in primary care and that it represents one of the most prevalent patient complaints. Virtually no studies of chronic pain have included adequate samples of low income and minority consumers, yet it is felt that these populations present special challenges in care management due to lack of education, the types of jobs they hold, and other environmental and psychosocial disadvantages. Physicians often report that they receive inadequate training on managing chronic nonmalignant pain and that they feel less confidence and are less satisfied with their management of chronic pain patients. Patients similarly report much less satisfaction with management of chronic pain compared to other health conditions. Further, recent controversies over the street use of effective chronic pain management medications (e.g. oxycontin) have made physicians even less confident and more concerned about how to appropriately treat patients. Using a framework of patient-centered care as the appropriate paradigm to improve chronic nonmalignant pain outcomes, the proposed exploratory study will further knowledge about the unique needs and issues confronted in managing chronic nonmalignant pain through addressing three major questions: 1) In racially diverse and economically disadvantaged primary care populations, what are the concerns and barriers faced by physicians and other primary care providers in delivering quality care to chronic, nonmalignant pain patients?; 2) What are the concerns and barriers about their care management identified by chronic pain patients in these settings and what suggestions do they have for improvements in their chronic pain care .management?; and 3) In what ways do provider and patient concerns and identified barriers converge or diverge and how do these convergences or divergences appear to relate to patient satisfaction and outcomes?

"Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Acute Pain Control DESCRIPTION (PROVIDED BY APPLICANT):    The long-term objective of this research is to ensure that all patients in pain who present to the Emergency Department (ED) receive appropriate pain management.  Pain is the most frequent reason for ED visits in the United States.  There is evidence that pain is inadequately treated in the ED, and studies in Atlanta and Los Angeles suggests that Blacks and Hispanics are less likely to receive adequate analgesia than are their white counterparts.  It is not clear, however, whether these difference, observed in retrospective chart reviews at single hospitals are purely local phenomena, or whether under-treatment of pain is more broadly associated with race or ethnicity in other settings.      We aim to compare pain management among three groups of ED patients. Hispanics, non-Hispanic, Black, non-Hispanic Whites, and to assess whether the observed association between pain management and race/ethnicity is independent of confounding variable such as age, sex, insurance status, education.  We also aim to assess whether the effect of race/ethnicity on adequacy of pain management is explained by (patient initial pain intensity) or by discordance between patients' and physicians': 1) race/ethnicity, b) physicians' perception of patient's pain.  To do this (285)  patients with long-bone fractures will be recruited in the EDs of one municipal and one voluntary hospital serving an inner-city, disadvantaged population in the Bronx.  Data will be collected on pain using self-reported pain [and non-verbal pain expressions] at baseline, one hour post-baseline, and at discharge.  Data on analgesics administered, patient and physician characteristics will also be gathered. [We plan to conduct a chart review of long fractures in 2000 and 2001 in order to analyze the association between race/ethnicity and pain management using the same design as all previously published studies.  Comparison of the retrospective and prospective results will strengthen inferences that can be drawn from our findings.]      Prospective quantification of disparities in acute pain management in ED's, which are the interface between the population and the health care system in times of crisis, and defining predictors of undertreatment of pain will enable health care providers to improve quality of care by developing guidelines for acute pain management in the ED.

"Cancer Pain Management-Decision Support Computer Program  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  More than 80% of cancer patients experience pain during the course of their illness or treatment.  Despite widespread dissemination and adoption of standard guidelines for cancer pain management, erroneous assessments and subsequent undertreatment and mistreatment of cancer pain are still common occurrences, disproportionately affecting women and ethnic minorities.  The purpose of this study is to develop a standardized decision support computer program (DSCP) (an expert system) with self-adaptation capabilities that can be used by nurses as an assessment support tool for dealing effectively with gender and ethnic differences in cancer pain experiences based on cancer patients' own views and experiences.  The specific aims are to: a) collect data on cancer pain among four ethnic groups (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic African-American, and non-Hispanic Asian) in the U.S.  and determine gender and ethnic differences in cancer pain experiences; and b) develop a DCSP based on these collected data and feedback from oncology nurses.  Using theoretical triangulation, a feminist approach and fuzzy logic will guide the research process.  Innovative internet data collection methods will be used including a quantitative Internet survey among 400 cancer patients recruited through general and ethnic-specific Internet Cancer Support Groups, and qualitative online forums of 6-months duration among four ethnically different groups (30 members per group) recruited from among the Internet survey participants.  Based on these data, a DSCP will be developed including Knowledge Base Generation, Decision-Making, and Self-Adaptation Modules.  Output of this expert system will be classification of patients' pain according to gender and ethnicity with suggested pain management strategies.  Online feedback from 30 oncology nurses will be incorporated into the DSCP to increase it acceptability among potential users.  Long-term goals are to: a) extend knowledge about gender and ethnic differences in cancer pain experience; b) contribute to recognition of patients' own cancer pain experience so that health care can be planned and provided from patients' own views and perspectives; c) develop a nursing expert system that can effectively guide cancer pain assessment and management in clinical settings; and d) ultimately eliminate gender and ethnic biases and inequity in cancer pain assessment and management.

"Oral Health Disparities: Actions Taken About Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the primary goals of Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population, with substantial emphasis given to disparities associated with race and ethnicity. The recent, first-ever Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health addresses the inequities and disparities among those least able to achieve optimal oral health, and relates the consequences as leading to needless pain and suffering. Studies show that pain is the most commonly reported impact of oral disease and is more strongly associated with perceived need for care, actual dental care, and diminished quality of life than other subjective signs or symptoms. We have conducted community-based studies that provide evidence that US minority adults are at increased risk for orofacial pain and are less likely to use oral health services in response to pain. However, there is little known about the interplay between race and ethnicity with individual, social, and economic characteristics as determinants of taking therapeutic action for orofacial pain. This project proposes to examine common and unique mechanisms underlying decisions to seek care or self-manage orofacial pain with a sampling strategy that will allow for comparisons among race and ethnic subgroups. Along with African- Americans, we have targeted Hispanic adults, a group that is particularly understudied regarding painful oral symptoms, given that they represent the fastest growing ethnic group in America. The aims of this study are to test hypothesis regarding: 1) Differences in the action taken to manage orofacial pain between minority Americans and non-Hispanic Whites; 2) That race and ethnicity interact with the sensory, emotional, and temporal characteristics of pain, behavioral and emotional impacts, and attitudes and beliefs about care as predictors of visiting a health care professional, engaging in pain self-management, or talking to others about pain. The study design will be a cross-sectional baseline study with a prospective longitudinal panel. We will conduct telephone interviews with a representative probability sample of community-dwelling adults, which will include oversampling of Hispanics and African-Americans within Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties in the state of Florida. Florida's population is rapidly increasing in both size and ethnic diversity and offers a unique opportunity to examine the interethnic differences in the actions taken to manage oral pain. This study proposes to use the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health to account for predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics as predictors of the targeted health enhancing behaviors. Unique contributions of this project will be the use of a validated model of health care use, the inclusion of a broad range of health behaviors (health care visits across multiple disciplines, self-care behaviors, and communicating with others), and the inclusion of Hispanic Americans. As culture can have a significant impact on the subjective experience of illness, differences in response to painful symptoms may help explain differences in behavioral options considered (or not considered) in response to oral disease. This information has important health policy implications for reducing the race and ethnic disparities in oral health through interventions that facilitate access to care and utilization of appropriate services.

"Low Back: A Multi-Center Clinical Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Low back pain is considered to be one of the most widely experienced health problems in the U.S. and the world. Estimated costs to those who are severely disabled from low back pain range from $30-70 billion annually. Rates of spinal surgery in the US have increased sharply over time, and 12-fold geographic variation in rates of these surgeries has been documented. Despite these trends, there is little evidence establishing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of surgical therapy versus non-operative management. The broad objective of the proposed research is to improve clinical decision making with respect to the surgical treatment of low back pain and associated leg symptoms in three major diagnostic groups: intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), spinal stenosis (SpS), and degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) has currently enrolled 2,317 patients with IDH, SpS and DS in three multi-center randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and associated observational cohorts to compare surgical to non-operative treatment for low back pain. By the end of the first funding cycle (November 2004),      states. When completed, this will be largest and most methodologically sound study of the three most common diagnostic groups for which spine surgery is performed. SPORT II will extend the original follow-up for an additional five years. The primary endpoints will be long-term changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 health status questionnaire and disease-specific disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary long-term endpoints will include patient satisfaction with treatment, preference-weighted health outcomes to estimate quality-adjusted life  years (QALYS), resource utilization and costs. SPORT II will provide insights into many methodological  and clinical questions, including the generalizability of RCT results; patient preferences; disparity issues  with respect to race, gender, and age; and geographic variability of clinical and economic outcomes.  The RCT and observational cohorts will be integrated to estimate the cost-effectiveness of surgical vs. nonoperative interventions. Completion of SPORT II will provide, for the first time, both short and long term scientific evidence as to the relative efficacy/effectiveness of surgical versus non-surgical treatment for the three most commonly diagnosed lumbar spine conditions.

"Cancer Pain Management-Decision Support Computer Program  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  More than 80% of cancer patients experience pain during the course of their illness or treatment.  Despite widespread dissemination and adoption of standard guidelines for cancer pain management, erroneous assessments and subsequent undertreatment and mistreatment of cancer pain are still common occurrences, disproportionately affecting women and ethnic minorities.  The purpose of this study is to develop a standardized decision support computer program (DSCP) (an expert system) with self-adaptation capabilities that can be used by nurses as an assessment support tool for dealing effectively with gender and ethnic differences in cancer pain experiences based on cancer patients' own views and experiences.  The specific aims are to: a) collect data on cancer pain among four ethnic groups (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic African-American, and non-Hispanic Asian) in the U.S.  and determine gender and ethnic differences in cancer pain experiences; and b) develop a DCSP based on these collected data and feedback from oncology nurses.  Using theoretical triangulation, a feminist approach and fuzzy logic will guide the research process.  Innovative internet data collection methods will be used including a quantitative Internet survey among 400 cancer patients recruited through general and ethnic-specific Internet Cancer Support Groups, and qualitative online forums of 6-months duration among four ethnically different groups (30 members per group) recruited from among the Internet survey participants.  Based on these data, a DSCP will be developed including Knowledge Base Generation, Decision-Making, and Self-Adaptation Modules.  Output of this expert system will be classification of patients' pain according to gender and ethnicity with suggested pain management strategies.  Online feedback from 30 oncology nurses will be incorporated into the DSCP to increase it acceptability among potential users.  Long-term goals are to: a) extend knowledge about gender and ethnic differences in cancer pain experience; b) contribute to recognition of patients' own cancer pain experience so that health care can be planned and provided from patients' own views and perspectives; c) develop a nursing expert system that can effectively guide cancer pain assessment and management in clinical settings; and d) ultimately eliminate gender and ethnic biases and inequity in cancer pain assessment and management.

"Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is one of the most costly and pervasive public health problems threatening the Untied States. While ethnic disparities in pain and its treatment have been reported, the influence of ethnicity on responses to analgesics has received scant attention. This study will use a common acute clinical pain model to identify and characterize psychosocial, physiological and genetic factors that contribute to ethnic group differences in pain perception and analgesia. Aim 1 will determine ethnic group differences in perceptual and physiological responses to acute post-operative pain and to examine how those are related to genetic, pre-operative psychophysical and psychosocial factors. Aim 2 will determine ethnic differences in opioid analgesia and side effects and to examine genetic, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and psychosocial factors that explain group differences in analgesic responses. 200 African American and white adults (age range 18-55) who undergo third molar extraction will be included in this study. We will assess preoperative experimental pain responses and psychosocial measures. We will monitor postoperative pain levels along with PK and PD responses to the opioid fentanyl. We will assess group differences in post-operative pain as well as analgesic responses immediately for several hours post surgery and up to 3 days post-procedure. My objectives are designed to establish a foundation upon which to build an independent research career in clinically-relevant experimental neuroscience pain research. The proposed training and mentored research will ultimately enhance my understanding of biopsychosocial factors that contribute to health disparities. I propose 4 main training objectives: 1) Develop expertise in psychophysical and clinical pain assessment with emphasis on ethnic differences; 2) Gain an understanding of the complex genetic, PK/PD processes involved in post-operative pain and analgesic responses; 3) Increase knowledge in advanced biostatistical methodology; and 4) Improve understanding of factors related to ethnic differences acute pain and analgesia. My long-term career goal is to develop a programmatic line of research designed to elucidate biopsychosocial contributions to ethnic differences in pain. Eventually, I would engage in translational research to reduce health disparities in clinical pain through the development of interventions designed to enhance the quality of life of individuals with pain, consistent with the strategic plan of NINDS.          ",Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response,7085648,K01NS055094,"['analgesic ', ' pain ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' clinical research ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2006,154934,0.47021887062908685

"Oral Health Disparities: Actions Taken About Pain DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the primary goals of Healthy People 2010 is to eliminate health disparities among different segments of the population, with substantial emphasis given to disparities associated with race and ethnicity. The recent, first-ever Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health addresses the inequities and disparities among those least able to achieve optimal oral health, and relates the consequences as leading to needless pain and suffering. Studies show that pain is the most commonly reported impact of oral disease and is more strongly associated with perceived need for care, actual dental care, and diminished quality of life than other subjective signs or symptoms. We have conducted community-based studies that provide evidence that US minority adults are at increased risk for orofacial pain and are less likely to use oral health services in response to pain. However, there is little known about the interplay between race and ethnicity with individual, social, and economic characteristics as determinants of taking therapeutic action for orofacial pain. This project proposes to examine common and unique mechanisms underlying decisions to seek care or self-manage orofacial pain with a sampling strategy that will allow for comparisons among race and ethnic subgroups. Along with African- Americans, we have targeted Hispanic adults, a group that is particularly understudied regarding painful oral symptoms, given that they represent the fastest growing ethnic group in America. The aims of this study are to test hypothesis regarding: 1) Differences in the action taken to manage orofacial pain between minority Americans and non-Hispanic Whites; 2) That race and ethnicity interact with the sensory, emotional, and temporal characteristics of pain, behavioral and emotional impacts, and attitudes and beliefs about care as predictors of visiting a health care professional, engaging in pain self-management, or talking to others about pain. The study design will be a cross-sectional baseline study with a prospective longitudinal panel. We will conduct telephone interviews with a representative probability sample of community-dwelling adults, which will include oversampling of Hispanics and African-Americans within Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties in the state of Florida. Florida's population is rapidly increasing in both size and ethnic diversity and offers a unique opportunity to examine the interethnic differences in the actions taken to manage oral pain. This study proposes to use the Andersen Behavioral Model of Health to account for predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics as predictors of the targeted health enhancing behaviors. Unique contributions of this project will be the use of a validated model of health care use, the inclusion of a broad range of health behaviors (health care visits across multiple disciplines, self-care behaviors, and communicating with others), and the inclusion of Hispanic Americans. As culture can have a significant impact on the subjective experience of illness, differences in response to painful symptoms may help explain differences in behavioral options considered (or not considered) in response to oral disease. This information has important health policy implications for reducing the race and ethnic disparities in oral health through interventions that facilitate access to care and utilization of appropriate services.

"Cognitive Behavioral Chronic Pain Trial Among Rural Minorities and non-Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in a rural area have a high occurrence of chronic pain. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely accepted evidence-based psychosocial treatment for chronic pain; its efficacy has been well established in multiple randomized clinical trials. However, there is no research testing the treatment efficacy of psychosocial interventions for chronic pain in rural populations. The primary objective of the proposed study (R21) is to test the efficacy of CBT compared to education attention control for rural individuals with chronic pain (ICPs). Ten weekly sessions of CBT or education treatment will be provided in small group format (6-8 individuals) at two rural health clinics for patients suffering from chronic pain. Treatment implementation measures will be used to ensure that therapists are delivering the treatment as planned and that patients understand and implement the treatment suggestions. The specific aims of this study are as follows: 1) To test the efficacy of CBT group treatment for rural ICPs, we will compare CBT outcomes to an education attention control condition. We hypothesize that participants in the CBT condition will report greater improvements in pain related outcomes (pain severity, perceived disability, depression, and quality of life) than control participants. 2) To test the mediational role of catastrophizing, a negative mental set about pain, on treatment outcomes in a rural population. We hypothesize that pain catastrophizing will mediate treatment outcome measures obtained at the end of treatment. A Secondary Aim is to explore potential differences in treatment outcome and treatment-related variables (treatment satisfaction, session attendance rate, drop out rate, and the ratio of invited participants versus those who participate) based on gender, education, income, and ethnicity. Providing CBT to rural ICPs is consistent with Healthy People 2010's two overarching goals of increasing the quality and years of healthy life and eliminating health disparities (DHHS, 2000). Rural citizens have a high incidence of chronic pain problems and they lack access to health care. Although psychosocial treatments for chronic pain have proven effective in urban populations, they have not been systematically tested in rural populations. This study will test the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment for chronic pain in two rural Alabama health clinics with a high percentage of African Americans.          ",Cognitive Behavioral Chronic Pain Trial Among Rural Minorities and non-Minorities,7303414,R21NR010112,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Range ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Alabama ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' neuroticism ', ' neurotic ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' Neuroses ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Anxiety ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Health Centers ', ' rural health clinic ', ' Rural Population ', ' Life ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Urban Population ', ' Attention ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' mental set ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' treatment site ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R21,2007,211571,0.38541533850465914

I propose 4 main training objectives: 1) Develop expertise in psychophysical and clinical pain assessment with emphasis on ethnic differences; 2) Gain an understanding of the complex genetic, PK/PD processes involved in post-operative pain and analgesic responses; 3) Increase knowledge in advanced biostatistical methodology; and 4) Improve understanding of factors related to ethnic differences acute pain and analgesia. My long-term career goal is to develop a programmatic line of research designed to elucidate biopsychosocial contributions to ethnic differences in pain. Eventually, I would engage in translational research to reduce health disparities in clinical pain through the development of interventions designed to enhance the quality of life of individuals with pain, consistent with the strategic plan of NINDS.          ",Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response,7216192,K01NS055094,"['Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Range ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Pain Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fentanyl ', ' Propanamide, N-phenyl-N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)- ', ' Phentanyl ', ' Fentyl ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Opioid ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Genetic ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' Attention ', ' Visual Analogue Pain Scale ', ' Hour ', ' day ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' third molar extraction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2007,157962,0.47021887062908685
"Ethnicity and Pain: Psychosocial Stress and Stress Responses    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is well-established that African Americans experience more clinical pain than non-Hispanic Whites. However, the reasons for this discrepancy in clinical pain are not known. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to investigate ethnic differences in stress responsive pain regulatory mechanisms and psychosocial stress, both of which may be related to ethnic differences in clinical pain prevalence and severity. Specifically, ethnic differences in temporal summation of heat pain, which may be indicative of central sensitization in pain pathways, the relationships involving stress-responsive biological measures and pain sensitivity, as well as psychosocial stress (socio-economic-status and discrimination stress), all known to predict pain clinical pain will be examined. A sample of 88 medically healthy individuals (50% African American, 50% non-Hispanic White; 50% Women in each ethnic group) will be recruited to participate. Individuals will report to the lab for a single testing session, during which the participants will complete psychosocial questionnaires to assess stress. The subjects will undergo testing for pain tolerance to cold pressor pain and the temporal summation procedure, which involves the delivery of 10 heat pulses at 52¿C. The increase in pain perception to the temporal summation procedure is centrally mediated, and it is predicted that African Americans will report a greater pain intensity rating at each trial and will have a greater drop-out rate. Blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine, cortisol, and beta-endorphin levels will then be measured at baseline rest and in response to the Trier Social Stress Test. It is predicted that greater psychosocial stress in African Americans will be associated with a blunted blood pressure and neuroendocrine response to stress and with the absence of predicted relationships involving stress- responsive biological factors and pain sensitivity. The results of this study are expected to provide insight into biobehavioral and psychosocial stress factors that may contribute to ethnic disparities in clinical pain.          ",Ethnicity and Pain: Psychosocial Stress and Stress Responses,7328680,F31DA023009,"['Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Purpose ', ' Down-Regulation ', ' Downregulation ', ' Down-Regulation (Physiology) ', ' Dropout ', ' Endorphins ', ' Address ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Range ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Rate ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' allostatic load ', ' Procedures ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hyperalgesia ', ' hyperalgia ', ' Hyperalgesic Sensations ', ' Peripheral ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Laboratories ', ' Failure (biologic function) ', ' failure ', ' FLR ', ' insight ', ' central pain ', ' cortical pain ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Nociceptors ', ' Norepinephrine ', ' Noradrenaline ', ' Levonorepinephrine ', ' Levarterenol ', ' 1,2-Benzenediol, 4-(2-amino-1-hydroxyethyl)-, (R)- ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Pulse taking ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Condition ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' Allopregnanolone ', ' Pregnanolone, (3alpha,5alpha)-isomer ', ' 3 alpha-Hydroxy-5 alpha-pregnan-20-one ', ' Knowledge ', ' Stress ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pulse ', ' Temperature ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Severities ', ' Reaction ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' beta-Endorphin ', ' beta-Lipotropin C Fragment ', ' beta-LPH (61-91) ', ' Lipotropin Fragment C ', ' Lipotropin 61-91 ', ' C-Fragment Endorphin ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stimulus interval ', ' stressor ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' Participant ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Disease regression ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Indwelling Catheter ', ' Venous Reservoirs ', ' In-Dwelling Catheters ', ' Implantable Catheters ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Trier Social Stress Test ', ' central sensitization ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,F31,2007,29292,0.3499064876412278
"Racial Differences in Physician-Patient Communication for Cancer Pain Management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BACKGROUND: Racial disparities exist in both the health and healthcare of Americans. We propose to assess patient-physician communication and indirectly assess physician bias through analysis of audio and videotapes of physician visits with unannounced standardized patients (SPs) who are randomly assigned to the physician on the basis of the SP race. SPECIFIC AIMS: (1) train black and white SPs with high degree of fidelity (2) to ensure SP realism in role and (3) to develop estimates for effect sizes for difference by race in physician prescribing for pain control and in physician-patient communication. METHODS: We will randomly assign participating physicians to unannounced black or white SPs. The SPs will be trained to portray lung cancer patients with severe pain who are new to the physicians' practice. Office visits will be recorded using hidden cameras.  We will compare visits between white and black SPs in terms of communication patterns, medical decision-making, and non-verbal behavior. PARTICIPANTS: Forty oncologists and primary care physicians in the local community will be recruited to participate. MEASURES: We will measure physician dosage and use of long acting pain medications, thoroughness of pain assessment, patient-centered communication, and autonomy support. SIGNIFICANCE: This study will advance research methodology, inform communication theory, and guide future research to improve communication and eliminate disparities in care. Use of SP methodology to study bias is an innovative adaptation of a methodology proven in other contexts.

"Cancer Pain Management-Decision Support Computer Program  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  More than 80% of cancer patients experience pain during the course of their illness or treatment.  Despite widespread dissemination and adoption of standard guidelines for cancer pain management, erroneous assessments and subsequent undertreatment and mistreatment of cancer pain are still common occurrences, disproportionately affecting women and ethnic minorities.  The purpose of this study is to develop a standardized decision support computer program (DSCP) (an expert system) with self-adaptation capabilities that can be used by nurses as an assessment support tool for dealing effectively with gender and ethnic differences in cancer pain experiences based on cancer patients' own views and experiences.  The specific aims are to: a) collect data on cancer pain among four ethnic groups (Hispanic, non-Hispanic Whites, non-Hispanic African-American, and non-Hispanic Asian) in the U.S.  and determine gender and ethnic differences in cancer pain experiences; and b) develop a DCSP based on these collected data and feedback from oncology nurses.  Using theoretical triangulation, a feminist approach and fuzzy logic will guide the research process.  Innovative internet data collection methods will be used including a quantitative Internet survey among 400 cancer patients recruited through general and ethnic-specific Internet Cancer Support Groups, and qualitative online forums of 6-months duration among four ethnically different groups (30 members per group) recruited from among the Internet survey participants.  Based on these data, a DSCP will be developed including Knowledge Base Generation, Decision-Making, and Self-Adaptation Modules.  Output of this expert system will be classification of patients' pain according to gender and ethnicity with suggested pain management strategies.  Online feedback from 30 oncology nurses will be incorporated into the DSCP to increase it acceptability among potential users.  Long-term goals are to: a) extend knowledge about gender and ethnic differences in cancer pain experience; b) contribute to recognition of patients' own cancer pain experience so that health care can be planned and provided from patients' own views and perspectives; c) develop a nursing expert system that can effectively guide cancer pain assessment and management in clinical settings; and d) ultimately eliminate gender and ethnic biases and inequity in cancer pain assessment and management.

"Building Bridges to Hospice and Rural Appalachia    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Palliative care, and specifically the management of pain issues, is an important and understudied issue in rural Appalachian Kentucky. Despite attempts to increase awareness on this issue, pain continues to be under-treated for chronic pain patients, including those with advanced disease and at end-of-life. This will only worsen as fears grow concerning prescription medication abuse and diversion. The application is designed to create a fully functioning community-based participatory research (CBPR) entity between the University of Kentucky (UK) and Hospice of the Bluegrass (HOB). One major outcome of this relationship is to conduct a formal needs-based assessment of frontline care workers (i.e., nurses, CNAs, social workers) who have to manage pain issues in a rural population noted for issues with prescription drug abuse and diversion. Data will be used for the purpose of identifying barriers to effective treatment and to gather initial data for a future interventional study. The needs assessment will be conducted through focus groups, key informant interviews, and assessment of frontline care workers at HOB. Specific attention will be paid to deficits in the knowledge base of providers regarding the appropriate use of opioid analgesics. To meet this end, assessment instruments will include worker demographics, a survey of their knowledge base and attitudes about pain management, a job satisfaction survey, and a measure of general self-efficacy. An additional survey on opioid knowledge and fear of use, along with a case vignette, will be developed to further round out the assessment package. As a final step, the study will conclude the needs-based assessment by conducting an agency wide survey at HOB to target future areas for applied research that address the application of clinical research needs pertinent to HOB and their patient population.          ",Building Bridges to Hospice and Rural Appalachia,7296119,R21NR009916,"['Data Collection ', ' Dedications ', ' Poa plant ', ' Bluegrass ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Purpose ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' end of life ', ' end-of-life ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Caring ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' prescription document ', ' Process ', ' point of care ', ' Family ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' State Interests ', ' Workplace ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' hospice environment ', ' Hospices ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Series ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Job Satisfaction ', ' Work Satisfaction ', ' Kentucky ', ' Leadership ', ' Rural ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ', ' National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (U.S.) ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' Collaborations ', ' Nurses ', ' Nursing Research ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Palliative Care ', ' comfort care ', ' Palliative Treatment ', ' Palliative Therapy ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' prescription procedure ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Rural Population ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Social Workers ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Attention ', ' Attitude ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Awareness ', ' Occupational ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' novel ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Applied Research ', ' Applied Science ', ' outreach ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' prescription drug abuse ', ' Measures ', ' Hospice Care ', ' End of Life Care ', ' Research Ethics Committees ', ' Rural Community ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' forging ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' cost-effective ', ' Population ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' medically underserved ', ' demographics ', ' community based participatory research ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY,R21,2007,186286,0.24191683632155755
"Pain Treatment Decisions: Influence of Sex, Race, and Age The proposed project is designed to investigate the relative contributions of gender, race and ethnicity, and age to health care providers decisions about pain treatment. Considerable anecdotal and correlational data suggest that men and women receive different treatment for a variety of pain conditions. Similarly, there are disparities in the treatment of different racial groups with respect to pain treatment. Our pilot research has shown that older pain sufferers may be less likely to receive pain medication compared to younger patients. The application represents a competing renewal of our ""Sex vs. Gender in Pain Perception"" grant which demonstrated that social learning, particularly genderrelated stereotypes and expectations about pain were powerful determinants of sex differences in pain responding. We also demonstrated that these gender-related expectations influenced the perception of others' pain. We propose to employ an innovative LENS model approach, delivered via the internet, to capture the decision policies of dentists, nurses, and physicians who will make decisions about multimedia case vignettes of ""Virtual Humans"" with different presentations of pain. The LENS model methodology will allow for the determination of an individual's or group's statistically reliable predictors of the decisions about pain treatment. The Web-based delivery system will allow for the recruitment of larger sample sizes with sufficient representation of sexes, and racial groups for statistical analyses of differences between them. By employing a facial expression coding system we will be able to standardize the degree of pain expression across gender and race. Systematic variability in decisions about pain treatment will therefore be a function of the health care provider's biases and expectations. This methodology will allow for an examination of the contribution of these key variables and tests of specific hypotheses about social learning influences on provider's treatment decisions. The research addresses the public health need to understand, recognize and change gender, race, and age biases in the assessment and treatment of pain. The results will have direct implications for treatment and the training of health care professionals, particularly in the assessment of gender, race, and age biases in their decisions about pain treatment.

"Cognitive Behavioral Chronic Pain Trial Among Rural Minorities and non-Minorities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals living in a rural area have a high occurrence of chronic pain. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely accepted evidence-based psychosocial treatment for chronic pain; its efficacy has been well established in multiple randomized clinical trials. However, there is no research testing the treatment efficacy of psychosocial interventions for chronic pain in rural populations. The primary objective of the proposed study (R21) is to test the efficacy of CBT compared to education attention control for rural individuals with chronic pain (ICPs). Ten weekly sessions of CBT or education treatment will be provided in small group format (6-8 individuals) at two rural health clinics for patients suffering from chronic pain. Treatment implementation measures will be used to ensure that therapists are delivering the treatment as planned and that patients understand and implement the treatment suggestions. The specific aims of this study are as follows: 1) To test the efficacy of CBT group treatment for rural ICPs, we will compare CBT outcomes to an education attention control condition. We hypothesize that participants in the CBT condition will report greater improvements in pain related outcomes (pain severity, perceived disability, depression, and quality of life) than control participants. 2) To test the mediational role of catastrophizing, a negative mental set about pain, on treatment outcomes in a rural population. We hypothesize that pain catastrophizing will mediate treatment outcome measures obtained at the end of treatment. A Secondary Aim is to explore potential differences in treatment outcome and treatment-related variables (treatment satisfaction, session attendance rate, drop out rate, and the ratio of invited participants versus those who participate) based on gender, education, income, and ethnicity. Providing CBT to rural ICPs is consistent with Healthy People 2010's two overarching goals of increasing the quality and years of healthy life and eliminating health disparities (DHHS, 2000). Rural citizens have a high incidence of chronic pain problems and they lack access to health care. Although psychosocial treatments for chronic pain have proven effective in urban populations, they have not been systematically tested in rural populations. This study will test the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral treatment for chronic pain in two rural Alabama health clinics with a high percentage of African Americans.          ",Cognitive Behavioral Chronic Pain Trial Among Rural Minorities and non-Minorities,7478822,R21NR010112,"['Healthy People 2010 ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Range ', ' Cognitive ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Future ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Alabama ', ' Biological ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' literacy ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Methods ', ' Neurotic Disorders ', ' neuroticism ', ' neurotic ', ' Psychoneuroses ', ' Neuroses ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' Poverty ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Anxiety ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Rural Health ', ' Rural Health Centers ', ' rural health clinic ', ' Rural Population ', ' Life ', ' Suggestion ', ' Testing ', ' Thinking, function ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' Time ', ' Treatment Protocols ', ' Treatment Schedule ', ' Treatment Regimen ', ' Urban Population ', ' Attention ', ' Severities ', ' Clinic ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Severity of illness ', ' disease severity ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' mental set ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Communities ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' treatment site ', ' Drops ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R21,2008,172913,0.38541533850465914
"Acupuncture to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment (ADDOPT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic pain is a significant public health problem, associated with impairments of physical and psychological functioning. While a third or more of the general population may suffer from chronic pain, it is often under recognized and under treated in health care settings. Low income and minority samples experience disparities in the prevalence of chronic pain, in perceived access to effective pain treatment, and in consultations for pain. A great deal of literature suggests that acupuncture offers potential benefit in the management of chronic pain, but it is rarely available to low income patients. The Acupuncture to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment (ADDOPT) project will introduce and evaluate the addition of acupuncture to the management of chronic pain for ethnically diverse, low-income primary care patients. The project represents a collaboration between the New York City Research and Improvement Networking Group (NYC RING), a practice-based research network dedicated to decreasing health disparities through primary care research, the Continuum Center for Health and Healing, and The Swedish Institute School of Acupuncture. Our intervention will involve addition of weekly acupuncture sessions at 3 urban primary care practices. During training sessions at each practice, primary care providers will become familiar with acupuncture and indications for referral. Patients will be eligible if they experience chronic pain due to neck pain, back pain, or osteoarthritis. Our process evaluation, guided by Glasgow's RE- AIM framework, will assess barriers to implementation and adoption of the intervention in busy urban practices and acceptability to patients and providers. We will employ a quasi- experimental design to assess primary outcomes (pain and quality of life) and obtain preliminary estimates of secondary outcomes (health care utilization and costs) of the intervention at each health center. This design will permit comparison across sites to discern practice level differences in uptake and outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: Chronic pain is often under recognized and under treated, especially in vulnerable populations. Acupuncture offers a potentially effective addition to pain management often not available to low-income patients. Our project will introduce acupuncture into chronic pain treatment in urban safety net primary care sites and evaluate the acceptability to patients, the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing pain and improving quality of life, and obtain preliminary estimates of the effect on health care utilization, medication use, and cost.          ",Acupuncture to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment (ADDOPT),7531356,R21AT004543,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Provider ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Site ', ' Healed ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Institutes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ', ' Joint Commission on Accreditation, Health Care Organizations ', ' JCAHO ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Literature ', ' uptake ', ' Neck ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' New York City ', ' Collaborations ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Schools ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Acupuncture procedure ', ' acupuncture ', ' day ', ' Pattern ', ' Back Pain ', ' Backache ', ' Back Ache ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' directed attention ', ' directs attention ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Neck Pain ', ' Neckache ', ' Neck Ache ', ' Cervicodynias ', ' Cervicodynia ', ' Cervicalgias ', ' Cervicalgia ', ' Cervical Pain ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sampling ', ' Specialist ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pain-Free ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Practice based research ', ' Impairment ', ' safety net ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NCCIH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2008,224316,0.45739719558578873
"Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is one of the most costly and pervasive public health problems threatening the Untied States. While ethnic disparities in pain and its treatment have been reported, the influence of ethnicity on responses to analgesics has received scant attention. This study will use a common acute clinical pain model to identify and characterize psychosocial, physiological and genetic factors that contribute to ethnic group differences in pain perception and analgesia. Aim 1 will determine ethnic group differences in perceptual and physiological responses to acute post-operative pain and to examine how those are related to genetic, pre-operative psychophysical and psychosocial factors. Aim 2 will determine ethnic differences in opioid analgesia and side effects and to examine genetic, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and psychosocial factors that explain group differences in analgesic responses. 200 African American and white adults (age range 18-55) who undergo third molar extraction will be included in this study. We will assess preoperative experimental pain responses and psychosocial measures. We will monitor postoperative pain levels along with PK and PD responses to the opioid fentanyl. We will assess group differences in post-operative pain as well as analgesic responses immediately for several hours post surgery and up to 3 days post-procedure. My objectives are designed to establish a foundation upon which to build an independent research career in clinically-relevant experimental neuroscience pain research. The proposed training and mentored research will ultimately enhance my understanding of biopsychosocial factors that contribute to health disparities. I propose 4 main training objectives: 1) Develop expertise in psychophysical and clinical pain assessment with emphasis on ethnic differences; 2) Gain an understanding of the complex genetic, PK/PD processes involved in post-operative pain and analgesic responses; 3) Increase knowledge in advanced biostatistical methodology; and 4) Improve understanding of factors related to ethnic differences acute pain and analgesia. My long-term career goal is to develop a programmatic line of research designed to elucidate biopsychosocial contributions to ethnic differences in pain. Eventually, I would engage in translational research to reduce health disparities in clinical pain through the development of interventions designed to enhance the quality of life of individuals with pain, consistent with the strategic plan of NINDS.          ",Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response,7432530,K01NS055094,"['Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Range ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Pain Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fentanyl ', ' Propanamide, N-phenyl-N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)- ', ' Phentanyl ', ' Fentyl ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Opioid ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Genetic ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' Attention ', ' Visual Analogue Pain Scale ', ' Hour ', ' day ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' third molar extraction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2008,161080,0.47021887062908685
"Disparities in Analgesic Preference for Cancer Pain: A Conjoint Analysis Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Meghani is a junior faculty member whose long-term career goal is to attain success as an independent investigator devoted to understanding and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain outcomes. Racial differences in the treatment of pain are increasingly reported in the literature. While the evidence of these differences is growing, the basis for them remains largely unknown. While provider and system-level factors contribute to these disparities, equally important is to understand factors that relate to patients' preference and use of analgesia for cancer pain. Through this 3-year K01 award, Dr. Meghani seeks to broaden her scientific approach to understanding disparities in cancer pain outcomes by engaging in extensive training in the theory and methodology of consumer behavior, patients' decision-making, and stated-preference techniques. The training plan takes advantage of the vast resources and scholarly opportunities available at the candidate's renowned academic center inclusive of the structured mentorship, didactic courses, informal seminars, institutes, and colloquia. The highly qualified mentorship team contributes complimentary expertise to the training plan and a multidisciplinary perspective representing the fields of medicine, nursing, and marketing. Utilizing Choice-based Conjoint (CBC) Analysis, a well established marketing technique to elicit consumer preference, the proposed research investigates 1) if African Americans and Whites have different preference structures related to analgesic treatment for cancer pain, and if so, what trade-offs they employ in making cancer pain treatment decisions; 2) what is the relative impact of patients' socio-demographic, illness, and pain-related characteristics on their analgesic preference; and 3) what is the relationship between patients' stated preferences and their reported adherence to prescription analgesic treatment for cancer pain. Data derived from the study will lay the foundation for candidate's long-term goal of developing patient-centered interventions incorporating patient preferences into complex medical decision-making. Relevance: Healthcare often involves making competing choices under risks and uncertainties. This research uses a novel technique to understand if African American and White patients with cancer pain use different mental trade-offs in arriving at pain treatment decisions; have differential preferences for cancer pain treatment; and how this may relate to their adherence to pain medications for cancer pain.          ",Disparities in Analgesic Preference for Cancer Pain: A Conjoint Analysis Study,7509954,K01NR010886,"['Process ', ' Faculty ', ' Guidelines ', ' Foundations ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Hypnosis ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institutes ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Numbers ', ' Literature ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' prescription procedure ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Condition ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Acupuncture procedure ', ' acupuncture ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Attitude ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' preference ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' consumer behavior ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' theories ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Litigation ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Consumer Preferences ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Review, Systematic (PT) ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Employment ', ' Symptoms ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Qualifying ', ' Range ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Title ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' prescription document ', ' Characteristics ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2008,91099,0.3899640369353326
"Ethnic differences in effects of opioid blockade and behavioral analgesia on pain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent pain is a public health epidemic producing enormous economic costs and profound human suffering. Considerable evidence indicates that, compared to non-Hispanic whites, African Americans are at substantially higher risk for experiencing severe, disabling, clinical pain states (both acute and chronic), and are more sensitive to a broad variety of noxious stimuli delivered in laboratory studies. While major advances in many areas of pain research have been made in recent years, explanations for the ethnic differences observed in responses to pain remain poorly understood. In light of the increasing diversity of the US population, illuminating the mechanisms that underlie ethnic differences in pain perception has become a topic of substantial scientific and clinical importance, and extending this line of research should eventually aid in reducing pain-related disparities in health. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to elucidate the role of the endogenous opioid system in contributing to ethnic differences in the experience of pain. Specifically, this project will investigate responses to capsaicin-induced pain, the analgesic effects produced by a cognitive-behavioral pain-coping strategy (i.e., distraction), and whether blockade of the endogenous opioid system affects ethnic differences in pain and analgesia in a sample of 52 medically healthy individuals (50% African American, 50% non-Hispanic White; 50% Women in each ethnic group). The aims of the current proposal are to: 1) evaluate ethnic differences in the contribution of endogenous opioids in pain perception of capsaicin induced pain; 2) characterize differences in the effectiveness of distraction analgesia during capsaicin-induced pain among African Americans and non-Hispanic whites; 3) determine whether ethnic differences in the effectiveness of a distraction analgesia task are influenced by endogenous opioids; and 4) whether psychological factors influence ethnic differences in pain sensitivity, response to the behavioral analgesic manipulation (distraction), or opioid receptor blockade. Subjects will participate in four experimental sessions (in a randomized order); in each of these they will be exposed to capsaicin ""alone"" or during a distraction task, and will undergo double-blinded administration of either naloxone, an opioid antagonist, or saline. Collectively, the findings from this proposed study will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying ethnic differences in pain perception, and will provide the most definitive answer to date regarding the contribution of endogenous opioids to ethnic differences in pain, Identifying the neurobiological pathways that contribute to ethnic differences in the experience of pain will eventually provide targets for intervention to reduce the scope and impact of pain among African-Americans.             ",Ethnic differences in effects of opioid blockade and behavioral analgesia on pain,7545033,F32NS063624,"['Effectiveness ', ' Purpose ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Economics ', ' distraction ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Pain Research ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Endogenous Opiates ', ' endogenous opioid ', ' Laboratories ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Opioid ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Naloxone ', ' Narcanti ', ' Narcan ', ' Morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenyl)-, (5alpha)- ', ' Narcotic Antagonists ', ' Opioid Antagonists ', ' Opiate Antagonist ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Perception ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saline ', ' Saline Solution ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Capsaicin ', ' 8-Methyl-N-Vanillyl-6-Nonenamide ', ' 6-Nonenamide, N-((4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl)-8-methyl-, (E)- ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cost ', ' coping ', ' Persistent pain ', ' Population ', ' ']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2008,46826,0.49752260916277885
"Low Back: A Multi-Center Clinical Trial DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Low back pain is considered to be one of the most widely experienced health problems in the U.S. and the world. Estimated costs to those who are severely disabled from low back pain range from $30-70 billion annually. Rates of spinal surgery in the US have increased sharply over time, and 12-fold geographic variation in rates of these surgeries has been documented. Despite these trends, there is little evidence establishing the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of surgical therapy versus non-operative management. The broad objective of the proposed research is to improve clinical decision making with respect to the surgical treatment of low back pain and associated leg symptoms in three major diagnostic groups: intervertebral disc herniation (IDH), spinal stenosis (SpS), and degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS). The Spine Patient Outcomes Research Trial (SPORT) has currently enrolled 2,317 patients with IDH, SpS and DS in three multi-center randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and associated observational cohorts to compare surgical to non-operative treatment for low back pain. By the end of the first funding cycle (November 2004),      states. When completed, this will be largest and most methodologically sound study of the three most common diagnostic groups for which spine surgery is performed. SPORT II will extend the original follow-up for an additional five years. The primary endpoints will be long-term changes in health-related quality of life as measured by the SF-36 health status questionnaire and disease-specific disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index. Secondary long-term endpoints will include patient satisfaction with treatment, preference-weighted health outcomes to estimate quality-adjusted life  years (QALYS), resource utilization and costs. SPORT II will provide insights into many methodological  and clinical questions, including the generalizability of RCT results; patient preferences; disparity issues  with respect to race, gender, and age; and geographic variability of clinical and economic outcomes.  The RCT and observational cohorts will be integrated to estimate the cost-effectiveness of surgical vs. nonoperative interventions. Completion of SPORT II will provide, for the first time, both short and long term scientific evidence as to the relative efficacy/effectiveness of surgical versus non-surgical treatment for the three most commonly diagnosed lumbar spine conditions.

"The influence of Race on Pain Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is the most common reason people access healthcare in the United States and has been identified as a major public health problem. Despite this attention, investigators have found racial and ethnic disparities in pain management. In systematic literature reviews, it has been found that African Americans are more at risk than Caucasians for experiencing under-treatment of pain (Cintron & Morrison, 2006; Ezenwa, Ameringer, Ward, & Serlin, 2006). There are also racial differences in the prevalence of pain. In a Center for Disease Control study using the 2002 National Health Interview Survey; it was found that 34% of African Americans compared to 22.6% of Caucasians with arthritis had severe pain (Bolen, Sniezek, Theis, Helmick, & et al., 2005). Consistent with the above report, there are racial differences on the impact of pain. For instance, 59.6% of African Americans compared to 30.3% of Caucasians reported pain severe enough to impact behavior (Riley & Gilbert, 2002). The overall goal of my program of research is to better understand racial disparities in pain management. As a first step toward this goal, I will explore the influence of two race-related stressors, perceived discrimination and hopelessness on disparities in pain management. Perceived discrimination is defined as chronic and routine experiences of unfair treatment. Hopelessness is a negative expectation about one's present and future life. This study will test relationships proposed in a conceptual model which suggests that the effect of race on pain outcomes (pain severity, opioid dose, satisfaction with pain treatment, and quality of life) is mediated by perceived discrimination and hopelessness. The specific aims of this study are (1) to examine the relationship between race and pain outcomes and (2) to test whether perceived discrimination and hopelessness mediate the relationship between race and pain outcomes. This study will be a secondary analysis of data from a large cross-sectional survey of patients with chronic noncancer pain. Understanding the role of perceived discrimination and hopelessness on disparities in pain management may be useful in the future design of culturally appropriate pain management educational interventions for African Americans and culturally sensitive educational interventions for healthcare providers. This study will help reduce the public health problems that arise from poorly treated pain (e.g., unnecessary suffering, delayed healing, and lengthened hospitalization).          ",The influence of Race on Pain Outcomes,7483486,F31NR010820,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' ward ', ' Dose ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Chronic ', ' Opioid ', ' satisfaction ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Review Literature ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arthritis ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Caucasians ', ' Severities ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' Controlled Study ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Impaired wound healing ', ' delayed wound healing ', ' abnormal tissue repair ', ' Impaired tissue repair ', ' Impaired healing ', ' Healing delayed ', ' Healing abnormal ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2008,40557,0.46643630762400157
"Ethnicity and Pain: Psychosocial Stress and Stress Responses DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We propose to investigate ethnic differences in biological pain regulatory mechanisms and psychosocial factors. Specifically, we will examine ethnic differences in temporal summation of heat pain, which may be indicative of central sensitization in pain pathways, the relationships involving stress-responsive biological measures and pain sensitivity, as well as psychosocial factors known to predict pain in African Americans. A sample of 88 medically healthy individuals (50% African American; 50% Women) will be recruited to participate. Individuals will report to the lab for a testing session, during which the participants will complete psychosocial measures to assess stress, coping, and emotion expression. The subjects will undergo testing for pain tolerance to hand cold pressor pain and tourniquet ischemic pain, and the temporal summation procedure involving delivery of heat pulses at 53¿C will be administered.. Blood pressure and plasma norepinephrine, cortisol, and beta-endorphin levels will then be measured at baseline and during a standardized mental stressor battery. The results of this study are expected to provide insight into biobehavioral and psychosocial factors that may contribute to ethnic disparities in clinical pain.

"Disparities in osteoarthritis: focus on occupational activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of pain and disability among older adults and therefore a condition of particular importance to the National Institute on Aging. Racial minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) are at greater risk for OA, and one key factor that may underlie these disparities is exposure to occupational and household tasks that involve substantial joint loading (i.e., bending, lifting heavy objects). The overall goal of this project is to advance understanding of specific occupational risks for knee and hip OA and how these factors may mediate racial and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence and severity of OA. This proposal is in response to NIH Program Announcement PA-06-0543, Mechanisms, Models, Measurement, and Management in Pain Research and will focus on two aspects of this PA: Epidemiology of Pain and Health Disparities. The proposed research involves a series of secondary data analyses of two large OA studies: the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project (JoCo OA) and the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). JoCo OA is one of the largest population-based prospective studies of OA, involving over 4,000 African American and Caucasian residents of Johnston County, NC. OAI is a multi-center longitudinal prospective observational study of knee OA, involving an ethnically diverse sample of approximately 4,500 individuals who have or are at risk for tibiofemoral OA. We will examine the following research questions among these two cohorts: 1. Do occupational and household activity exposures mediate associations of race and SES with hip and knee OA prevalence and radiographic severity? 2. Do current occupational and household activities mediate the association of race with joint pain severity or progression in pain severity in knee OA? 3. Are occupational and household activity exposures associated with OA incidence, and do these associations differ according to race or SES? We have outlined specific plans for seven sets of analyses related to the above research questions, and based on these findings will also conduct additional analyses in areas of importance. We plan to complete three sets of analyses in year one and four sets of analyses in year two of the award period, submitting a corresponding manuscript for each. Because osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability, affecting about half of all older adults, it is a key public health concern. This project aims to understand how occupational and household activities are related to OA and whether these risk factors explain the higher rates of OA that have been observed among racial minority groups and individuals with lower socioeconomic status. This information will ultimately be used to design programs to reduce occupational and household risks for OA among vulnerable individuals.

"Pain Treatment Decisions: Influence of Sex, Race, and Age    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project is designed to investigate the relative contributions of gender, race and ethnicity, and age to health care providers decisions about pain treatment. Considerable anecdotal and correlational data suggest that men and women receive different treatment for a variety of pain conditions. Similarly, there are disparities in the treatment of different racial groups with respect to pain treatment. Published data and our pilot research have shown that older pain sufferers may be less likely to receive pain medication compared to younger patients. The application represents a competing renewal of our ""Sex vs. Gender in Pain Perception"" grant which demonstrated that social learning, particularly gender-related stereotypes and expectations about pain were powerful determinants of sex differences in pain responding. We also demonstrated that these gender-related expectations influenced the perception of others' pain. We propose to employ an innovative LENS model approach, delivered via the internet, to capture the decision policies of dentists, nurses, and physicians who will make decisions about multimedia case vignettes of ""Virtual Humans"" with different presentations of pain. The LENS model methodology will allow for the determination of an individual's or group's statistically reliable predictors of the decisions about pain treatment. The innovative, ""Virtual Human"", Web-based delivery system will allow for the recruitment of larger sample sizes with sufficient representation of sexes, and racial groups for statistical analyses of differences between them. By employing a facial expression coding system we will be able to standardize the degree of pain expression across gender, age, and race. Systematic variability in decisions about pain treatment will therefore be a function of the health care provider's predisposition to use sex, race, and age cues in making decisions about pain. This methodology will allow for an examination of the contribution of these key variables and tests of specific hypotheses about social learning influences on provider's treatment decisions. The research addresses the public health need to understand, recognize and change gender, race, and age disparities in the assessment and treatment of pain.

"A Novel Approach to Elucidate Mechanisms for Disparity in Cancer Pain Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Title: A Novel Approach to Elucidate Mechanisms for Disparity in Cancer Pain Outcomes This study responds to the broad challenge area (04) Clinical Research, and the specific challenge topic, 04- NR-102* Methods to Enhance Palliative Care and End-of-Life Research.      Racial/ethnic disparities in palliative care outcomes are increasingly reported in the literature including inequalities in hospice enrollment, differential preference for high technology care at the end-of-life, and disparities in symptom management outcomes. Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis (CBC) is promising valuation technique grounded in the Random Utility Theory and mathematical psychology to understand what people value and what really drives them to choose one set of alternatives over another when faced with competing choices. While the technique is well established in the marketing arena and consumer research, the application of CBC in the healthcare field is relatively new, although there is growing interest in this methodology. CBC may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic disparities in palliative care outcomes. This potentially important application of CBC in studying sources of disparities has not been exploited in palliative care research. Using cancer pain treatment disparities as an exemplar, we propose to investigate the utility and predictive validity of CBC in identifying mechanisms underlying racial disparities in cancer pain treatment outcomes. Accumulating evidence suggests that African Americans are less likely to receive guideline recommended analgesia despite risk-adjustment and even among those insured at similar levels as non-minority individuals. The system and provider-level factors have not been able to fully explicate the mechanisms contributing to these disparities. Patient-level factors, including patients' attitudes and preferences towards pain treatment, that may also account for clinical disparities may hold the answer. Using CBC, this prospective study offers a unique conceptual, methodological, and analytical lens to understanding what value patients place in analgesic treatment for cancer pain and link this unique information to a comprehensive set of socio-demographic, illness and pain-related variables. Predictive ability of a measure is a critical determinant of its validity; the proposed study also assesses the predictive validity of CBC by investigating the relationship between stated preference (CBC utilities) and actual adherence to prescription analgesia for cancer pain. Moreover, the research carefully incorporates an analysis of racial disparities across aims to further understanding of clinical differences in cancer pain outcomes. The scientific approach identified in this study will lay the foundation for developing patient-centered interventions that incorporate patient preferences into complex medical decision-making in improving cancer pain outcomes and by extension outcomes in other symptom management settings. At University of Pennsylvania, we are well-positioned to quickly expand our research capacity and employee- base benefitting the science and the overall economy. In keeping with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the current project will create 7 new jobs (1 full-time, 4 part-time, and 2 per-diem). Healthcare often involves making competing choices under risks and uncertainties. This research uses a novel technique, Choice-based Conjoint Analysis (CBC), to understand if African Americans and Whites with cancer pain use different mental trade-offs in arriving at pain treatment decisions; have differential preferences for cancer pain treatment; and how this may relate to their adherence to pain medications for cancer pain. CBC method has implications for generating knowledge about how subgroups of patients make decisions regarding choices such as symptom management, advanced care planning, hospice enrollment, or the use of technologically advanced end-of-life care. Findings will help identify targets sensitive to tailored, patient-centered interventions in improving equity in palliative care outcomes.               Project Narrative: Healthcare often involves making competing choices under risks and uncertainties.

"Sex Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Responses: Psychosocial and Genetic I    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sex Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Responses: Psychosocial and Genetic Influences ABSTRACT: Pain is one of the most costly and pervasive public health problems, with women and minorities facing increased risk for under-treated and mismanaged pain. Women, compared to men, report more frequent and intense pain and have increased prevalence of debilitating pain across a multitude of conditions. Women also represent the majority of the 40 million outpatient and ambulatory surgeries conducted each year. Acute post- operative pain and under-treatment of pain are well-documented and lead to prolonged recovery and potentially to development of chronic long-term pain conditions. Despite incongruent findings of sex differences in analgesic efficacy, consistent reports show that women experience between 30%-75% more adverse drug reactions (ADRs) compared to men. ADRs can lead to life-threatening complications, discontinuation of pain treatment, prolonged recovery and non-compliance. Recent pharmacogenomic studies have demonstrated that genotype may contribute to sex differences in pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) responses to certain drugs. Genetic and nongenetic contributions to sex differences in opioid analgesia, related side effects and treatment outcome have received limited attention in the field of pain research. This study will use a common acute clinical pain model to identify and characterize psychosocial, physiological and genetic factors that contribute to sex differences in pain perception, analgesia and side effects. Aim 1 will determine sex differences in perceptual and physiological responses to acute post-operative pain and will examine how those are related to genetic, pre-operative psychophysical and psychosocial factors. Aim 2 will determine sex differences in opioid analgesia and side effects and will examine genetic, PK, PD, and psychosocial factors that explain group differences in analgesic responses. 140 male and female patients (age range 16-45) who undergo third molar extraction will be included in this study. Preoperatively, we will assess experimental pain responses and psychosocial measures. We will monitor post-operative pain levels along with PK/PD responses to the opioid fentanyl. We will examine sex differences in post-operative pain, analgesic responses and side effects immediately and for several hours post-surgery and for 3 days post-procedure. The study is designed to build a foundation for a R01 grant proposal supporting an independent line of clinically-relevant experimental pain research. This project will enhance understanding of translational research in pain as well as biopsychosocial factors that contribute to health disparities in pain and its treatment, particularly for women. Additionally, this study will provide insight into the complex genetic, PK/PD processes involved in post- operative pain and analgesic responses and will elucidate biopsychosocial contributions to sex differences in pain and side effects. The ultimate goal is to develop translational research that will reduce the increased burden of clinical pain in women through the development of tailored interventions designed to enhance the quality of life for women, consistent with priorities of the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain is one of the most costly and pervasive public health problems in the United States, and women are at increased risk for under-treatment of pain.

"Disparities in Analgesic Preference for Cancer Pain: A Conjoint Analysis Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Meghani is a junior faculty member whose long-term career goal is to attain success as an independent investigator devoted to understanding and eliminating racial/ethnic disparities in cancer pain outcomes. Racial differences in the treatment of pain are increasingly reported in the literature. While the evidence of these differences is growing, the basis for them remains largely unknown. While provider and system-level factors contribute to these disparities, equally important is to understand factors that relate to patients' preference and use of analgesia for cancer pain. Through this 3-year K01 award, Dr. Meghani seeks to broaden her scientific approach to understanding disparities in cancer pain outcomes by engaging in extensive training in the theory and methodology of consumer behavior, patients' decision-making, and stated-preference techniques. The training plan takes advantage of the vast resources and scholarly opportunities available at the candidate's renowned academic center inclusive of the structured mentorship, didactic courses, informal seminars, institutes, and colloquia. The highly qualified mentorship team contributes complimentary expertise to the training plan and a multidisciplinary perspective representing the fields of medicine, nursing, and marketing. Utilizing Choice-based Conjoint (CBC) Analysis, a well established marketing technique to elicit consumer preference, the proposed research investigates 1) if African Americans and Whites have different preference structures related to analgesic treatment for cancer pain, and if so, what trade-offs they employ in making cancer pain treatment decisions; 2) what is the relative impact of patients' socio-demographic, illness, and pain-related characteristics on their analgesic preference; and 3) what is the relationship between patients' stated preferences and their reported adherence to prescription analgesic treatment for cancer pain. Data derived from the study will lay the foundation for candidate's long-term goal of developing patient-centered interventions incorporating patient preferences into complex medical decision-making. Relevance: Healthcare often involves making competing choices under risks and uncertainties. This research uses a novel technique to understand if African American and White patients with cancer pain use different mental trade-offs in arriving at pain treatment decisions; have differential preferences for cancer pain treatment; and how this may relate to their adherence to pain medications for cancer pain.          ",Disparities in Analgesic Preference for Cancer Pain: A Conjoint Analysis Study,7661399,K01NR010886,"['Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Neuraxis ', ' Central Nervous System ', ' CNS Nervous System ', ' Accounting ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' alternative treatment ', ' Congresses ', ' meeting reports ', ' Decision Making ', ' Provider ', ' Dependency (Psychology) ', ' emotional dependency ', ' Dependency ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' Employment ', ' Symptoms ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ', ' ECOG ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Qualifying ', ' Cancer Center ', ' trend ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Faculty ', ' Guidelines ', ' Foundations ', ' Imagery ', ' Visualization ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' systematic review ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Hypnosis ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institutes ', ' Training ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' Literature ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' American Cancer Society ', ' Marketing ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Staging ', ' Shapes ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Acupuncture procedure ', ' acupuncture ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Attitude ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' preference ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' consumer behavior ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Litigation ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Consumer Preferences ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Uncertainty ', ' doubt ', ' theories ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Societies ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,K01,2009,28965,0.3899640369353326
"Psycho-sociocultural factors influencing cancer pain management in elderly adults    DESCRIPTION (from applicant): Epidemiological evidence shows that elderly minority adults are less likely to have their cancer pain recorded, are at an increased risk for the misdiagnosis and under-treatment of their cancer pain, and report less relief or analgesic treatment for their pain. This project proposes two phases, a descriptive survey and an educational pain management intervention, to assess if such disparities are influenced by identified social, cultural, or psychological constructs. The primary objective for phase I (descriptive) is to elucidate existing social, cultural, and psychological sources that may influence the experience of cancer pain, satisfaction with cancer pain care and management in elderly Blacks and Whites diagnosed with lung, colon, breast, or prostate cancer. The aims to support this objective are to: 1) assess whether elderly Black and White cancer patients differ in social (discrimination, SES), cultural (cultural heritage, ethnic identity), and psychological (depression, physician mistrust, symptom distress) variables, and to determine if these factors serve as potential mediators explaining differential health outcomes, 2) determine the relationship between identified psychosocial and cultural factors, and 3) assess the utility of a proposed theoretical model in explaining individual differences in identified health outcome variables both within and between race groups of elderly cancer patients. Guided by phase I's conceptual model, the objective for phase II (intervention) is to: 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a cancer pain management education intervention among elderly Black and White cancer patients, and 2) evaluate patients' reactions to and satisfaction with the program, while identifying potential psychological, social, and cultural constructs that present as barriers to effective pain management. To date, we have identified no studies that have examined the impact identified psychosocial and cultural factors (e.g., discrimination, ethnic identity) have on optimal cancer pain management. In addition, there are few interventions designed to address these constructs as they relate to cancer pain care and management among the elderly. Examining these factors will prove pivotal in potentially reducing disparities and eliminating barriers to cancer pain care and management.           ",Psycho-sociocultural factors influencing cancer pain management in elderly adults,7586886,K01CA131722,"['cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' Breast ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Colon ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' depression ', ' Critiques ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Economics ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' symptom management ', ' Florida ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Benign ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' Learning ', ' Literature ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' satisfaction ', ' Mails ', ' Methods ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Social Discrimination ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Arthritis ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Supervision ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Cancer Pain Management ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Investigation ', ' Work ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,K01,2009,130943,0.3600762999568671
"Ethnic differences in effects of opioid blockade and behavioral analgesia on pain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persistent pain is a public health epidemic producing enormous economic costs and profound human suffering. Considerable evidence indicates that, compared to non-Hispanic whites, African Americans are at substantially higher risk for experiencing severe, disabling, clinical pain states (both acute and chronic), and are more sensitive to a broad variety of noxious stimuli delivered in laboratory studies. While major advances in many areas of pain research have been made in recent years, explanations for the ethnic differences observed in responses to pain remain poorly understood. In light of the increasing diversity of the US population, illuminating the mechanisms that underlie ethnic differences in pain perception has become a topic of substantial scientific and clinical importance, and extending this line of research should eventually aid in reducing pain-related disparities in health. Therefore, the purpose of this proposal is to elucidate the role of the endogenous opioid system in contributing to ethnic differences in the experience of pain. Specifically, this project will investigate responses to capsaicin-induced pain, the analgesic effects produced by a cognitive-behavioral pain-coping strategy (i.e., distraction), and whether blockade of the endogenous opioid system affects ethnic differences in pain and analgesia in a sample of 52 medically healthy individuals (50% African American, 50% non-Hispanic White; 50% Women in each ethnic group). The aims of the current proposal are to: 1) evaluate ethnic differences in the contribution of endogenous opioids in pain perception of capsaicin induced pain; 2) characterize differences in the effectiveness of distraction analgesia during capsaicin-induced pain among African Americans and non-Hispanic whites; 3) determine whether ethnic differences in the effectiveness of a distraction analgesia task are influenced by endogenous opioids; and 4) whether psychological factors influence ethnic differences in pain sensitivity, response to the behavioral analgesic manipulation (distraction), or opioid receptor blockade. Subjects will participate in four experimental sessions (in a randomized order); in each of these they will be exposed to capsaicin ""alone"" or during a distraction task, and will undergo double-blinded administration of either naloxone, an opioid antagonist, or saline. Collectively, the findings from this proposed study will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying ethnic differences in pain perception, and will provide the most definitive answer to date regarding the contribution of endogenous opioids to ethnic differences in pain, Identifying the neurobiological pathways that contribute to ethnic differences in the experience of pain will eventually provide targets for intervention to reduce the scope and impact of pain among African-Americans.             ",Ethnic differences in effects of opioid blockade and behavioral analgesia on pain,7644392,F32NS063624,"['Effectiveness ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' distraction ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Pain Research ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Individual ', ' Literature ', ' Opioid ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Naloxone ', ' Narcanti ', ' Narcan ', ' Morphinan-6-one, 4,5-epoxy-3,14-dihydroxy-17-(2-propenyl)-, (5alpha)- ', ' Narcotic Antagonists ', ' Opioid Antagonists ', ' Opiate Antagonist ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Perception ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Saline ', ' Saline Solution ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Techniques ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' economic cost ', ' Laboratory Study ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Capsaicin ', ' 8-Methyl-N-Vanillyl-6-Nonenamide ', ' 6-Nonenamide, N-((4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl)-8-methyl-, (E)- ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' coping ', ' Persistent pain ', ' Population ', ' high risk ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Future ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Affect ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Man (Taxonomy) ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Endogenous Opiates ', ' endogenous opioid ', ' Laboratories ', ' insight ', ' Stimulus ', ' ']",NINDS,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,F32,2009,48185,0.49752260916277885
"Acupuncture to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment (ADDOPT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic pain is a significant public health problem, associated with impairments of physical and psychological functioning. While a third or more of the general population may suffer from chronic pain, it is often under recognized and under treated in health care settings. Low income and minority samples experience disparities in the prevalence of chronic pain, in perceived access to effective pain treatment, and in consultations for pain. A great deal of literature suggests that acupuncture offers potential benefit in the management of chronic pain, but it is rarely available to low income patients. The Acupuncture to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment (ADDOPT) project will introduce and evaluate the addition of acupuncture to the management of chronic pain for ethnically diverse, low-income primary care patients. The project represents a collaboration between the New York City Research and Improvement Networking Group (NYC RING), a practice-based research network dedicated to decreasing health disparities through primary care research, the Continuum Center for Health and Healing, and The Swedish Institute School of Acupuncture. Our intervention will involve addition of weekly acupuncture sessions at 3 urban primary care practices. During training sessions at each practice, primary care providers will become familiar with acupuncture and indications for referral. Patients will be eligible if they experience chronic pain due to neck pain, back pain, or osteoarthritis. Our process evaluation, guided by Glasgow's RE- AIM framework, will assess barriers to implementation and adoption of the intervention in busy urban practices and acceptability to patients and providers. We will employ a quasi- experimental design to assess primary outcomes (pain and quality of life) and obtain preliminary estimates of secondary outcomes (health care utilization and costs) of the intervention at each health center. This design will permit comparison across sites to discern practice level differences in uptake and outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: Chronic pain is often under recognized and under treated, especially in vulnerable populations. Acupuncture offers a potentially effective addition to pain management often not available to low-income patients. Our project will introduce acupuncture into chronic pain treatment in urban safety net primary care sites and evaluate the acceptability to patients, the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing pain and improving quality of life, and obtain preliminary estimates of the effect on health care utilization, medication use, and cost.          ",Acupuncture to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment (ADDOPT),7681156,R21AT004543,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Provider ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' practice-based research network ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Site ', ' Healed ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Institutes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ', ' Joint Commission on Accreditation, Health Care Organizations ', ' JCAHO ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Literature ', ' uptake ', ' Neck ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' New York City ', ' Collaborations ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Schools ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Acupuncture procedure ', ' acupuncture ', ' Pattern ', ' Back Pain ', ' Backache ', ' Back Ache ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' directed attention ', ' directs attention ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Neck Pain ', ' Neckache ', ' Neck Ache ', ' Cervicodynias ', ' Cervicodynia ', ' Cervicalgias ', ' Cervicalgia ', ' Cervical Pain ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sampling ', ' Specialist ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pain-Free ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' safety net ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' routine care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NCCIH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2009,249162,0.45739719558578873
"Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is one of the most costly and pervasive public health problems threatening the Untied States. While ethnic disparities in pain and its treatment have been reported, the influence of ethnicity on responses to analgesics has received scant attention. This study will use a common acute clinical pain model to identify and characterize psychosocial, physiological and genetic factors that contribute to ethnic group differences in pain perception and analgesia. Aim 1 will determine ethnic group differences in perceptual and physiological responses to acute post-operative pain and to examine how those are related to genetic, pre-operative psychophysical and psychosocial factors. Aim 2 will determine ethnic differences in opioid analgesia and side effects and to examine genetic, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and psychosocial factors that explain group differences in analgesic responses. 200 African American and white adults (age range 18-55) who undergo third molar extraction will be included in this study. We will assess preoperative experimental pain responses and psychosocial measures. We will monitor postoperative pain levels along with PK and PD responses to the opioid fentanyl. We will assess group differences in post-operative pain as well as analgesic responses immediately for several hours post surgery and up to 3 days post-procedure. My objectives are designed to establish a foundation upon which to build an independent research career in clinically-relevant experimental neuroscience pain research. The proposed training and mentored research will ultimately enhance my understanding of biopsychosocial factors that contribute to health disparities. I propose 4 main training objectives: 1) Develop expertise in psychophysical and clinical pain assessment with emphasis on ethnic differences; 2) Gain an understanding of the complex genetic, PK/PD processes involved in post-operative pain and analgesic responses; 3) Increase knowledge in advanced biostatistical methodology; and 4) Improve understanding of factors related to ethnic differences acute pain and analgesia. My long-term career goal is to develop a programmatic line of research designed to elucidate biopsychosocial contributions to ethnic differences in pain. Eventually, I would engage in translational research to reduce health disparities in clinical pain through the development of interventions designed to enhance the quality of life of individuals with pain, consistent with the strategic plan of NINDS.          ",Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response,7596327,K01NS055094,"['Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' third molar extraction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Pain Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fentanyl ', ' Propanamide, N-phenyl-N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)- ', ' Phentanyl ', ' Fentyl ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Opioid ', ' analog ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Genetic ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' Attention ', ' Hour ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2009,164293,0.47021887062908685
"HIV-associated Neuropathy: Ethnic Disparities and Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minorities and women now account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections. Neuropathy is the most common neurologic complication of HIV, occurring in up to 60% of patients with advanced disease. Neuropathy is commonly painful and can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Recent clinical trials of treatment for neuropathic pain related to HIV have had disappointing results, raising the question of whether the study medications truly lack efficacy, or if the instruments used to measure pain were poorly suited to the population under study. Pilot data suggest there may be racial and ethnic differences in clinical manifestations of HIV-associated neuropathy, including pain. The goal of this project is to better define these differences and to explore their neuro-biologic and socio-cultural underpinnings. Specific aims are: 1. To determine whether there are differences between racial and ethnic groups in clinical and neurophysiologic features of HIV-associated neuropathy 2. To determine if commonly used pain scales adequately reflect the pain experience of minority, low-literacy patients with HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy (HIV-DSP) 3. To determine whether autonomic neuropathy (AN) is prevalent in HIV-positive minorities 4. To determine whether the characteristic peripheral nerve and skin biopsy pathology of HIV-DSP in the HAART-era varies with race or ethnicity Retrospective analyses will be performed on data collected by the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium and the CNS HIV Antiretroviral Effects Research Study. Going forward, predominantly minority patients will be recruited for detailed neurologic assessment including: administration of pain and symptom scales; detailed neurologic assessment and quantification of deficits using validated instruments; neurophysiologic testing (nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing and autonomic testing); and skin biopsy. Peripheral nerve pathology will be studied using autopsy specimens from the Manhattan HIV Brain Bank.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropathy is a common complication of HIV which significantly reduces quality of life, and for which there is no FDA-approved treatment. HIV now disproportionately affects minorities, so if effective treatments for neuropathy are to be developed, more information is needed about its clinical and pathologic manifestations in these populations, including the reporting of pain.           ",HIV-associated Neuropathy: Ethnic Disparities and Pathogenesis,7757948,K23NS066789,"['Skin ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Polyneuropathy ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Affect ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' literacy ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' autonomic neuropathy ', ' Neural Conduction ', ' Nerve Conduction ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Hypersensitivity skin testing ', ' immunologic skin test ', ' hypersensitivity test ', ' Skin Tests ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' Sensory ', ' Biopsy ', ' experience ', ' immunopathology ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' advanced disease ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Accounting ', ' Complication ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' National NeuroAids Tissue Consortium ', ' NNTC ', ' ']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2009,170127,0.3691724212408785
"Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is one of the most costly and pervasive public health problems threatening the Untied States. While ethnic disparities in pain and its treatment have been reported, the influence of ethnicity on responses to analgesics has received scant attention. This study will use a common acute clinical pain model to identify and characterize psychosocial, physiological and genetic factors that contribute to ethnic group differences in pain perception and analgesia. Aim 1 will determine ethnic group differences in perceptual and physiological responses to acute post-operative pain and to examine how those are related to genetic, pre-operative psychophysical and psychosocial factors. Aim 2 will determine ethnic differences in opioid analgesia and side effects and to examine genetic, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and psychosocial factors that explain group differences in analgesic responses. 200 African American and white adults (age range 18-55) who undergo third molar extraction will be included in this study. We will assess preoperative experimental pain responses and psychosocial measures. We will monitor postoperative pain levels along with PK and PD responses to the opioid fentanyl. We will assess group differences in post-operative pain as well as analgesic responses immediately for several hours post surgery and up to 3 days post-procedure. My objectives are designed to establish a foundation upon which to build an independent research career in clinically-relevant experimental neuroscience pain research. The proposed training and mentored research will ultimately enhance my understanding of biopsychosocial factors that contribute to health disparities. I propose 4 main training objectives: 1) Develop expertise in psychophysical and clinical pain assessment with emphasis on ethnic differences; 2) Gain an understanding of the complex genetic, PK/PD processes involved in post-operative pain and analgesic responses; 3) Increase knowledge in advanced biostatistical methodology; and 4) Improve understanding of factors related to ethnic differences acute pain and analgesia. My long-term career goal is to develop a programmatic line of research designed to elucidate biopsychosocial contributions to ethnic differences in pain. Eventually, I would engage in translational research to reduce health disparities in clinical pain through the development of interventions designed to enhance the quality of life of individuals with pain, consistent with the strategic plan of NINDS.

"The influence of Race on Pain Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is the most common reason people access healthcare in the United States and has been identified as a major public health problem. Despite this attention, investigators have found racial and ethnic disparities in pain management. In systematic literature reviews, it has been found that African Americans are more at risk than Caucasians for experiencing under-treatment of pain (Cintron & Morrison, 2006; Ezenwa, Ameringer, Ward, & Serlin, 2006). There are also racial differences in the prevalence of pain. In a Center for Disease Control study using the 2002 National Health Interview Survey; it was found that 34% of African Americans compared to 22.6% of Caucasians with arthritis had severe pain (Bolen, Sniezek, Theis, Helmick, & et al., 2005). Consistent with the above report, there are racial differences on the impact of pain. For instance, 59.6% of African Americans compared to 30.3% of Caucasians reported pain severe enough to impact behavior (Riley & Gilbert, 2002). The overall goal of my program of research is to better understand racial disparities in pain management. As a first step toward this goal, I will explore the influence of two race-related stressors, perceived discrimination and hopelessness on disparities in pain management. Perceived discrimination is defined as chronic and routine experiences of unfair treatment. Hopelessness is a negative expectation about one's present and future life. This study will test relationships proposed in a conceptual model which suggests that the effect of race on pain outcomes (pain severity, opioid dose, satisfaction with pain treatment, and quality of life) is mediated by perceived discrimination and hopelessness. The specific aims of this study are (1) to examine the relationship between race and pain outcomes and (2) to test whether perceived discrimination and hopelessness mediate the relationship between race and pain outcomes. This study will be a secondary analysis of data from a large cross-sectional survey of patients with chronic noncancer pain. Understanding the role of perceived discrimination and hopelessness on disparities in pain management may be useful in the future design of culturally appropriate pain management educational interventions for African Americans and culturally sensitive educational interventions for healthcare providers. This study will help reduce the public health problems that arise from poorly treated pain (e.g., unnecessary suffering, delayed healing, and lengthened hospitalization).          ",The influence of Race on Pain Outcomes,7578236,F31NR010820,"['Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' ward ', ' Dose ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' National Health Interview Survey ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Chronic ', ' Opioid ', ' satisfaction ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Review Literature ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arthritis ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Attention ', ' Caucasians ', ' Severities ', ' Behavior ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' Controlled Study ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Reporting ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Modeling ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Impaired wound healing ', ' delayed wound healing ', ' abnormal tissue repair ', ' Impaired tissue repair ', ' Impaired healing ', ' Healing delayed ', ' Healing abnormal ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN-MADISON,F31,2009,21745,0.46643630762400157
"Do Patient Requests Affect Doctor's Decisions? A Complementary Experimental and Q    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. healthcare environment has changed dramatically in the last several decades. Patients are increasingly knowledge-empowered (through internet access) and ""activated"" (through direct advertising) to seek care from physicians who are increasingly salaried employees in large medical settings (adhering to organizational priorities). ""Activated patients"" often suggest specific diagnoses to their primary care physicians. Some 30 percent now request specific medications (discovered on television or by internet searches) of which 40 percent receive the requested prescription. Using complementary research methods (factorial experimentation and rigorous qualitative research) we propose to: a) describe how different primary care physicians respond to specific prescription requests from different patients (factorial experiment); and b) explain the reasons why they do so (""think aloud"" qualitative techniques). Within a single, cost-efficient study, we propose two experiments focusing on common medical conditions (sciatica and osteoarthritis of the knee) which generate high levels of healthcare utilization, prescribing and costs, to address the following specific aims: 1. To estimate the independent influence of patient attributes on a physician's compliance with a request for a pain medication. Is a request from certain patients more likely to be successful? 2. To estimate the independent influence of provider characteristics on the diagnosis and management of the two pain conditions presented. Are certain physicians more likely to accede to a patient's request? 3. To understand the influence of healthcare system or organizational factors on prescribing and management. Does the size, ownership, practice setting or practice culture influence decisions? 4. A complementary qualitative component will identify the underlying cognitive reasoning processes that explain the observed variability in decisions uncovered by the experimental component of the study. Our findings will have implications for everyday clinical practice, healthcare policy and educational interventions designed to improve the quality of decision making. First, variability in the quality of care provided by primary care physicians for commonly presented pain is of widespread national concern. Second, the influence of patient requests on provider behavior remains poorly understood, but is likely to increase in the U.S. and elsewhere (DTCA of pharmaceuticals is about to be introduced throughout the countries of the European Union). Third, polypharmacy (especially pain medications) is of increasing concern in the US, particularly among older patients with multiple co-morbidities who often consult a range of specialists in addition to primary care providers. Fourth, moving from the description of healthcare variations (how?) to explanation of their cognitive origins (why?) marks a new direction in clinical decision making research and is a necessary pre-requisite for educational interventions. Public Health Relevance: We propose to use a factorial experiment to understand Clinical Decision Making (CDM) when activated patients make requests for a specific pain medication. The implications for a continual and rapid increase of direct to consumer advertising (by Internet, TV, and print), broadening health disparities in chronic pain management, and growing prevalence of chronic pain has significant health policy implications. This study aims to disentangle the patient (gender, race, SES) and physician factors (experience and gender) related to chronic pain management and opioid use, and underlying cognitive reasoning that produce the decisions we observe.                           7.

"Disparities in osteoarthritis: focus on occupational activity    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is the leading cause of pain and disability among older adults and therefore a condition of particular importance to the National Institute on Aging. Racial minorities and individuals with low socioeconomic status (SES) are at greater risk for OA, and one key factor that may underlie these disparities is exposure to occupational and household tasks that involve substantial joint loading (i.e., bending, lifting heavy objects). The overall goal of this project is to advance understanding of specific occupational risks for knee and hip OA and how these factors may mediate racial and socioeconomic disparities in the prevalence and severity of OA. This proposal is in response to NIH Program Announcement PA-06-0543, Mechanisms, Models, Measurement, and Management in Pain Research and will focus on two aspects of this PA: Epidemiology of Pain and Health Disparities. The proposed research involves a series of secondary data analyses of two large OA studies: the Johnston County Osteoarthritis Project (JoCo OA) and the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI). JoCo OA is one of the largest population-based prospective studies of OA, involving over 4,000 African American and Caucasian residents of Johnston County, NC. OAI is a multi-center longitudinal prospective observational study of knee OA, involving an ethnically diverse sample of approximately 4,500 individuals who have or are at risk for tibiofemoral OA. We will examine the following research questions among these two cohorts: 1. Do occupational and household activity exposures mediate associations of race and SES with hip and knee OA prevalence and radiographic severity? 2. Do current occupational and household activities mediate the association of race with joint pain severity or progression in pain severity in knee OA? 3. Are occupational and household activity exposures associated with OA incidence, and do these associations differ according to race or SES? We have outlined specific plans for seven sets of analyses related to the above research questions, and based on these findings will also conduct additional analyses in areas of importance. We plan to complete three sets of analyses in year one and four sets of analyses in year two of the award period, submitting a corresponding manuscript for each. Because osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and disability, affecting about half of all older adults, it is a key public health concern. This project aims to understand how occupational and household activities are related to OA and whether these risk factors explain the higher rates of OA that have been observed among racial minority groups and individuals with lower socioeconomic status. This information will ultimately be used to design programs to reduce occupational and household risks for OA among vulnerable individuals.

"Psycho-sociocultural factors influencing cancer pain management in elderly adults    DESCRIPTION (from applicant): Epidemiological evidence shows that elderly minority adults are less likely to have their cancer pain recorded, are at an increased risk for the misdiagnosis and under-treatment of their cancer pain, and report less relief or analgesic treatment for their pain. This project proposes two phases, a descriptive survey and an educational pain management intervention, to assess if such disparities are influenced by identified social, cultural, or psychological constructs. The primary objective for phase I (descriptive) is to elucidate existing social, cultural, and psychological sources that may influence the experience of cancer pain, satisfaction with cancer pain care and management in elderly Blacks and Whites diagnosed with lung, colon, breast, or prostate cancer. The aims to support this objective are to: 1) assess whether elderly Black and White cancer patients differ in social (discrimination, SES), cultural (cultural heritage, ethnic identity), and psychological (depression, physician mistrust, symptom distress) variables, and to determine if these factors serve as potential mediators explaining differential health outcomes, 2) determine the relationship between identified psychosocial and cultural factors, and 3) assess the utility of a proposed theoretical model in explaining individual differences in identified health outcome variables both within and between race groups of elderly cancer patients. Guided by phase I's conceptual model, the objective for phase II (intervention) is to: 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a cancer pain management education intervention among elderly Black and White cancer patients, and 2) evaluate patients' reactions to and satisfaction with the program, while identifying potential psychological, social, and cultural constructs that present as barriers to effective pain management. To date, we have identified no studies that have examined the impact identified psychosocial and cultural factors (e.g., discrimination, ethnic identity) have on optimal cancer pain management. In addition, there are few interventions designed to address these constructs as they relate to cancer pain care and management among the elderly. Examining these factors will prove pivotal in potentially reducing disparities and eliminating barriers to cancer pain care and management.           RELEVANCE (See instructions):  There is growing concen that minority cancer patients are less likely to have their cancer pain recorded,  report receiving less pain relief or analgesic treatment, and are at an increased risk for the misdiagnosis and  undertreatment of their cancer pain. There is a collective urgency to address these factors, and to implement  interventions that may assist in reducing these inequities and disparities, particularly among the elderly  patient.",Psycho-sociocultural factors influencing cancer pain management in elderly adults,7938804,K01CA131722,"['Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Economics ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Symptoms ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' racism ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' post intervention ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mails ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Prostate ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Social Discrimination ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Cancer Pain Management ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Breast ', ' Participant ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Genus Cola ', ' Cola ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Colon ', ' Instruction ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Outcome ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,K01,2010,135739,0.3863339039134626
"Acupuncture to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment (ADDOPT)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic pain is a significant public health problem, associated with impairments of physical and psychological functioning. While a third or more of the general population may suffer from chronic pain, it is often under recognized and under treated in health care settings. Low income and minority samples experience disparities in the prevalence of chronic pain, in perceived access to effective pain treatment, and in consultations for pain. A great deal of literature suggests that acupuncture offers potential benefit in the management of chronic pain, but it is rarely available to low income patients. The Acupuncture to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment (ADDOPT) project will introduce and evaluate the addition of acupuncture to the management of chronic pain for ethnically diverse, low-income primary care patients. The project represents a collaboration between the New York City Research and Improvement Networking Group (NYC RING), a practice-based research network dedicated to decreasing health disparities through primary care research, the Continuum Center for Health and Healing, and The Swedish Institute School of Acupuncture. Our intervention will involve addition of weekly acupuncture sessions at 3 urban primary care practices. During training sessions at each practice, primary care providers will become familiar with acupuncture and indications for referral. Patients will be eligible if they experience chronic pain due to neck pain, back pain, or osteoarthritis. Our process evaluation, guided by Glasgow's RE- AIM framework, will assess barriers to implementation and adoption of the intervention in busy urban practices and acceptability to patients and providers. We will employ a quasi- experimental design to assess primary outcomes (pain and quality of life) and obtain preliminary estimates of secondary outcomes (health care utilization and costs) of the intervention at each health center. This design will permit comparison across sites to discern practice level differences in uptake and outcomes.       PUBLIC HEALTH REVELANCE: Chronic pain is often under recognized and under treated, especially in vulnerable populations. Acupuncture offers a potentially effective addition to pain management often not available to low-income patients. Our project will introduce acupuncture into chronic pain treatment in urban safety net primary care sites and evaluate the acceptability to patients, the effectiveness of acupuncture in reducing pain and improving quality of life, and obtain preliminary estimates of the effect on health care utilization, medication use, and cost.          ",Acupuncture to Decrease Disparities in Outcomes of Pain Treatment (ADDOPT),7916349,R21AT004543,"['cost effectiveness ', ' Provider ', ' Complementary and alternative medicine ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Low income ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Process ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Adoption ', ' Future ', ' practice-based research network ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Site ', ' Healed ', ' Phase ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Institutes ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations ', ' Joint Commission on Accreditation, Health Care Organizations ', ' JCAHO ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Literature ', ' uptake ', ' Neck ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' New York City ', ' Collaborations ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Schools ', ' programs ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Acupuncture procedure ', ' acupuncture ', ' Pattern ', ' Back Pain ', ' Backache ', ' Back Ache ', ' Visit ', ' Services ', ' directed attention ', ' directs attention ', ' experience ', ' functional status ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Reporting ', ' Neck Pain ', ' Neckache ', ' Neck Ache ', ' Cervicodynias ', ' Cervicodynia ', ' Cervicalgias ', ' Cervicalgia ', ' Cervical Pain ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Sampling ', ' Specialist ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Pain-Free ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' healing ', ' health related quality of life ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' safety net ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' routine care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' usual care ', ' Consultations ', ' ']",NCCIH,ALBERT EINSTEIN COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,R21,2010,283514,0.45739719558578873
"Sex Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Responses: Psychosocial and Genetic I    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sex Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Responses: Psychosocial and Genetic Influences ABSTRACT: Pain is one of the most costly and pervasive public health problems, with women and minorities facing increased risk for under-treated and mismanaged pain. Women, compared to men, report more frequent and intense pain and have increased prevalence of debilitating pain across a multitude of conditions. Women also represent the majority of the 40 million outpatient and ambulatory surgeries conducted each year. Acute post- operative pain and under-treatment of pain are well-documented and lead to prolonged recovery and potentially to development of chronic long-term pain conditions. Despite incongruent findings of sex differences in analgesic efficacy, consistent reports show that women experience between 30%-75% more adverse drug reactions (ADRs) compared to men. ADRs can lead to life-threatening complications, discontinuation of pain treatment, prolonged recovery and non-compliance. Recent pharmacogenomic studies have demonstrated that genotype may contribute to sex differences in pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) responses to certain drugs. Genetic and nongenetic contributions to sex differences in opioid analgesia, related side effects and treatment outcome have received limited attention in the field of pain research. This study will use a common acute clinical pain model to identify and characterize psychosocial, physiological and genetic factors that contribute to sex differences in pain perception, analgesia and side effects. Aim 1 will determine sex differences in perceptual and physiological responses to acute post-operative pain and will examine how those are related to genetic, pre-operative psychophysical and psychosocial factors. Aim 2 will determine sex differences in opioid analgesia and side effects and will examine genetic, PK, PD, and psychosocial factors that explain group differences in analgesic responses. 140 male and female patients (age range 16-45) who undergo third molar extraction will be included in this study. Preoperatively, we will assess experimental pain responses and psychosocial measures. We will monitor post-operative pain levels along with PK/PD responses to the opioid fentanyl. We will examine sex differences in post-operative pain, analgesic responses and side effects immediately and for several hours post-surgery and for 3 days post-procedure. The study is designed to build a foundation for a R01 grant proposal supporting an independent line of clinically-relevant experimental pain research. This project will enhance understanding of translational research in pain as well as biopsychosocial factors that contribute to health disparities in pain and its treatment, particularly for women. Additionally, this study will provide insight into the complex genetic, PK/PD processes involved in post- operative pain and analgesic responses and will elucidate biopsychosocial contributions to sex differences in pain and side effects. The ultimate goal is to develop translational research that will reduce the increased burden of clinical pain in women through the development of tailored interventions designed to enhance the quality of life for women, consistent with priorities of the NIH Office of Research on Women's Health.

"RidCancerPain Intervention in a Hispanic Population Along the US-Mexico Border    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Developing, testing, and refining a culturally and linguistically appropriate intervention for Mexican Americans with cancer pain will contribute to the elimination of health disparities in this population. This goal is congruent with the overall NIH mission to support science that reduces the burden of illness and disability. Funding will stimulate the educational and economic status of students by providing five job positions (ARRA purpose) and expose Hispanic nursing students to meritorious research. Last, the project will strengthen the research capacity of the School of Nursing in a Minority Serving Institution (R-15 purpose) by increasing the pool of future nurse scientists and establishing the infrastructure for future research in a minority population plagued   with disparities. Cancer pain is of significant concern on social, economic and individual levels for the estimated 11 million Americans who have a cancer diagnosis (American Cancer Society, 2008). In a recent systematic review of the world-wide prevalence of pain in patients with cancer, those with metastatic, advanced or terminal disease reported pain prevalence rates of 64%, with more than one-third grading their pain as moderate or severe (vanden Beuken-van Everdingen et al., 2007). Individuals from underserved populations are more likely than the overall United States population to suffer from inadequate cancer pain management (Cintron & Morrison, 2006; Green et al., 2003; McNeill, Reynolds, & Ney, 2007; National Cancer Institute, 2005). Such disparities in pain management increase the likelihood of minorities suffering from the costly consequences of uncontrolled pain such as depression, sleep disorders, lost work productivity, and impaired relationships with family and friends (American Pain Foundation, 2009; Monsivais & Robinson, 2008). Patient beliefs, attitudes, and communication styles are tightly interwoven, culturally bound, and can be significant barriers to effective pain management (Ward et al., 1993; Gunnarsdottir, Donovan, Serlin, Voge, & Ward, 2002). In turn, inadequate assessment by providers of patients' beliefs and attitudes, coupled with poor provider communication, contribute to disparities in cancer pain management for vulnerable populations   (Green et al., 2003; Cintron & Morrison, 2006; McNeill et al., 2007). Cancer pain communication problems are of special concern for those of Hispanic origin, because cancers with higher rates among Hispanics, such as stomach, liver, biliary tract, and uterine cervix, are generally associated with extreme pain (American Cancer Society, 2009). In areas along the US-Mexico border in far west Texas where Hispanics of Mexican American origin exceed 78% of the population, the need for culturally and linguistically effective interventions for improved cancer pain management is critical. Emerging evidence suggests an individualized educational intervention called RidCancerPain (Ward et al,   2008; Ward et al., 2009) is effective in overcoming barriers to pain management and can promote decreased pain, improved mood, and increased quality of life. Further testing of this promising intervention is needed in minority populations. Therefore the purpose of this study is to develop, test, and refine a cancer pain intervention to meet the cultural and linguistic needs of Hispanics along the US-Mexico border. We will do this by translating the RidCancerPain intervention into Spanish and pilot testing the intervention for acceptability and feasibility in the target population. This process will include the translation of other research materials necessary for pilot-testing the intervention, i.e. Barriers Questionnaire II (BQ II), Satisfaction Survey, and a single item eligibility question. The specific aims of this project are to: 1. Translate the RidCancerPain intervention guide, Barriers Questionnaire II (BQ II), Satisfaction Survey, and eligibility question into Spanish by using teams of undergraduate students under the supervision of the co-investigator to conduct text analysis and extensive research in constructive corpus terminology, translate, and field test the intervention guide and other materials into Spanish for Spanish speakers living along the US-Mexico border (Hatim, 2001; House, 1981, 1997; Toury, 1995) 2. Test the acceptability of the RidCancerPain intervention in a Hispanic Population along the US-Mexico Border by conducting a pretest-posttest single group trial and measuring acceptability of the intervention with the Satisfaction Survey 3. Assess the feasibility of conducting a trial of the RidCancerPain intervention in a Hispanic Population with cancer-related pain along the US-Mexico Border including obtaining initial estimates of the effect sizes by conducting a pretest-posttest single group trial. This project will set the stage for submitting an application to conduct a large, well-powered randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the RidCancerPain intervention. The future study will test the hypothesis that RidCancerPain is more efficacious than standard care with respect to decreasing attitudinal barriers and improving cancer pain management for a Hispanic population along the US-Mexico border.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer pain is of significant concern on social, economic, and individual levels for the estimated 11 million Americans with a cancer diagnosis. The RidCancerPain intervention will enhance effective pain management strategies for Hispanics along the US-Mexico   border, a goal congruent with the overall NIH mission to support science that reduces the   burden of illness and disability.           Cancer pain is of significant concern on social, economic, and individual levels for the estimated 11 million Americans with a cancer diagnosis.

"Do Patient Requests Affect Doctor's Decisions? A Complementary Experimental and Q    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. healthcare environment has changed dramatically in the last several decades. Patients are increasingly knowledge-empowered (through internet access) and ""activated"" (through direct advertising) to seek care from physicians who are increasingly salaried employees in large medical settings (adhering to organizational priorities). ""Activated patients"" often suggest specific diagnoses to their primary care physicians. Some 30 percent now request specific medications (discovered on television or by internet searches) of which 40 percent receive the requested prescription. Using complementary research methods (factorial experimentation and rigorous qualitative research) we propose to: a) describe how different primary care physicians respond to specific prescription requests from different patients (factorial experiment); and b) explain the reasons why they do so (""think aloud"" qualitative techniques). Within a single, cost-efficient study, we propose two experiments focusing on common medical conditions (sciatica and osteoarthritis of the knee) which generate high levels of healthcare utilization, prescribing and costs, to address the following specific aims: 1. To estimate the independent influence of patient attributes on a physician's compliance with a request for a pain medication. Is a request from certain patients more likely to be successful? 2. To estimate the independent influence of provider characteristics on the diagnosis and management of the two pain conditions presented. Are certain physicians more likely to accede to a patient's request? 3. To understand the influence of healthcare system or organizational factors on prescribing and management. Does the size, ownership, practice setting or practice culture influence decisions? 4. A complementary qualitative component will identify the underlying cognitive reasoning processes that explain the observed variability in decisions uncovered by the experimental component of the study. Our findings will have implications for everyday clinical practice, healthcare policy and educational interventions designed to improve the quality of decision making. First, variability in the quality of care provided by primary care physicians for commonly presented pain is of widespread national concern. Second, the influence of patient requests on provider behavior remains poorly understood, but is likely to increase in the U.S. and elsewhere (DTCA of pharmaceuticals is about to be introduced throughout the countries of the European Union). Third, polypharmacy (especially pain medications) is of increasing concern in the US, particularly among older patients with multiple co-morbidities who often consult a range of specialists in addition to primary care providers. Fourth, moving from the description of healthcare variations (how?) to explanation of their cognitive origins (why?) marks a new direction in clinical decision making research and is a necessary pre-requisite for educational interventions. Public Health Relevance: We propose to use a factorial experiment to understand Clinical Decision Making (CDM) when activated patients make requests for a specific pain medication. The implications for a continual and rapid increase of direct to consumer advertising (by Internet, TV, and print), broadening health disparities in chronic pain management, and growing prevalence of chronic pain has significant health policy implications. This study aims to disentangle the patient (gender, race, SES) and physician factors (experience and gender) related to chronic pain management and opioid use, and underlying cognitive reasoning that produce the decisions we observe.                           7.

"Yoga vs. Physical Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain in Minority Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects 5-10% of U.S. adults annually and disproportionately impacts individuals from minority and low income backgrounds due to disparities in access and treatment. Pilot data collected at one of the proposed study sites demonstrate yoga is a feasible and possibly effective intervention for CLBP in minority populations. Evidence from multiple studies supports a moderate benefit in CLBP for exercise therapy individually-delivered by a physical therapist. Moreover, physical therapy is the most common, reimbursed, non-pharmacologic treatment recommended by physicians for CLBP. Our primary study objective is to compare the effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for the treatment of CLBP in a predominantly low income minority population. A 12 week comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial for CLBP is proposed with three treatment arms: (1) A standardized weekly hatha yoga protocol delivered in a class format; (2) a standardized evidence-based exercise therapy protocol individually delivered by a physical therapist; and (3) education delivered through a self-care book. A racially diverse population of 260 adults with CLBP will be recruited from Boston Medical Center and six affiliated community health centers and randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to yoga, physical therapy, and education, respectively. The application's primary aim is to determine the comparative effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for three outcomes at 12 weeks: pain intensity, back-specific function, and use of pain medication. For each of these outcomes, patients randomized to the yoga group are hypothesized to demonstrate clinically and statistically greater improvements than patients in the physical therapy or education groups. After the 12 week intervention period, half of the yoga and physical therapy participants will be randomly selected to participate in a 40 week ongoing structured yoga or physical therapy maintenance program. Pain, function, and pain medication use will be compared between maintenance and non-maintenance groups. Cost and utilization data will also be collected so cost effectiveness analyses from the perspective of society, the third party payer, and the patient can be performed. Together, results from these studies will help determine whether it is justifiable for yoga, currently a ""complementary"" therapy, to become an acceptable ""mainstream"" treatment for chronic low back pain. 1   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic low back pain is a substantial cause of suffering, disability, and cost in U.S. society. Individuals from low income minority backgrounds may be more affected by chronic low back pain due to disparities in health care access and treatment.

"A Novel Approach to Elucidate Mechanisms for Disparity in Cancer Pain Outcomes    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Title: A Novel Approach to Elucidate Mechanisms for Disparity in Cancer Pain Outcomes This study responds to the broad challenge area (04) Clinical Research, and the specific challenge topic, 04- NR-102* Methods to Enhance Palliative Care and End-of-Life Research.      Racial/ethnic disparities in palliative care outcomes are increasingly reported in the literature including inequalities in hospice enrollment, differential preference for high technology care at the end-of-life, and disparities in symptom management outcomes. Choice-Based Conjoint Analysis (CBC) is promising valuation technique grounded in the Random Utility Theory and mathematical psychology to understand what people value and what really drives them to choose one set of alternatives over another when faced with competing choices. While the technique is well established in the marketing arena and consumer research, the application of CBC in the healthcare field is relatively new, although there is growing interest in this methodology. CBC may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying racial/ethnic disparities in palliative care outcomes. This potentially important application of CBC in studying sources of disparities has not been exploited in palliative care research. Using cancer pain treatment disparities as an exemplar, we propose to investigate the utility and predictive validity of CBC in identifying mechanisms underlying racial disparities in cancer pain treatment outcomes. Accumulating evidence suggests that African Americans are less likely to receive guideline recommended analgesia despite risk-adjustment and even among those insured at similar levels as non-minority individuals. The system and provider-level factors have not been able to fully explicate the mechanisms contributing to these disparities. Patient-level factors, including patients' attitudes and preferences towards pain treatment, that may also account for clinical disparities may hold the answer. Using CBC, this prospective study offers a unique conceptual, methodological, and analytical lens to understanding what value patients place in analgesic treatment for cancer pain and link this unique information to a comprehensive set of socio-demographic, illness and pain-related variables. Predictive ability of a measure is a critical determinant of its validity; the proposed study also assesses the predictive validity of CBC by investigating the relationship between stated preference (CBC utilities) and actual adherence to prescription analgesia for cancer pain. Moreover, the research carefully incorporates an analysis of racial disparities across aims to further understanding of clinical differences in cancer pain outcomes. The scientific approach identified in this study will lay the foundation for developing patient-centered interventions that incorporate patient preferences into complex medical decision-making in improving cancer pain outcomes and by extension outcomes in other symptom management settings. At University of Pennsylvania, we are well-positioned to quickly expand our research capacity and employee- base benefitting the science and the overall economy. In keeping with the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the current project will create 7 new jobs (1 full-time, 4 part-time, and 2 per-diem). Healthcare often involves making competing choices under risks and uncertainties. This research uses a novel technique, Choice-based Conjoint Analysis (CBC), to understand if African Americans and Whites with cancer pain use different mental trade-offs in arriving at pain treatment decisions; have differential preferences for cancer pain treatment; and how this may relate to their adherence to pain medications for cancer pain. CBC method has implications for generating knowledge about how subgroups of patients make decisions regarding choices such as symptom management, advanced care planning, hospice enrollment, or the use of technologically advanced end-of-life care. Findings will help identify targets sensitive to tailored, patient-centered interventions in improving equity in palliative care outcomes.               Project Narrative: Healthcare often involves making competing choices under risks and uncertainties.

"Pain Treatment Decisions: Influence of Sex, Race, and Age    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed project is designed to investigate the relative contributions of gender, race and ethnicity, and age to health care providers decisions about pain treatment. Considerable anecdotal and correlational data suggest that men and women receive different treatment for a variety of pain conditions. Similarly, there are disparities in the treatment of different racial groups with respect to pain treatment. Published data and our pilot research have shown that older pain sufferers may be less likely to receive pain medication compared to younger patients. The application represents a competing renewal of our ""Sex vs. Gender in Pain Perception"" grant which demonstrated that social learning, particularly gender-related stereotypes and expectations about pain were powerful determinants of sex differences in pain responding. We also demonstrated that these gender-related expectations influenced the perception of others' pain. We propose to employ an innovative LENS model approach, delivered via the internet, to capture the decision policies of dentists, nurses, and physicians who will make decisions about multimedia case vignettes of ""Virtual Humans"" with different presentations of pain. The LENS model methodology will allow for the determination of an individual's or group's statistically reliable predictors of the decisions about pain treatment. The innovative, ""Virtual Human"", Web-based delivery system will allow for the recruitment of larger sample sizes with sufficient representation of sexes, and racial groups for statistical analyses of differences between them. By employing a facial expression coding system we will be able to standardize the degree of pain expression across gender, age, and race. Systematic variability in decisions about pain treatment will therefore be a function of the health care provider's predisposition to use sex, race, and age cues in making decisions about pain. This methodology will allow for an examination of the contribution of these key variables and tests of specific hypotheses about social learning influences on provider's treatment decisions. The research addresses the public health need to understand, recognize and change gender, race, and age disparities in the assessment and treatment of pain. The results will have direct implications for treatment and the training of health care professionals, particularly in the assessment of gender, race, and age in their decisions about pain treatment.

"Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pain is one of the most costly and pervasive public health problems threatening the Untied States. While ethnic disparities in pain and its treatment have been reported, the influence of ethnicity on responses to analgesics has received scant attention. This study will use a common acute clinical pain model to identify and characterize psychosocial, physiological and genetic factors that contribute to ethnic group differences in pain perception and analgesia. Aim 1 will determine ethnic group differences in perceptual and physiological responses to acute post-operative pain and to examine how those are related to genetic, pre-operative psychophysical and psychosocial factors. Aim 2 will determine ethnic differences in opioid analgesia and side effects and to examine genetic, pharmacokinetic (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD), and psychosocial factors that explain group differences in analgesic responses. 200 African American and white adults (age range 18-55) who undergo third molar extraction will be included in this study. We will assess preoperative experimental pain responses and psychosocial measures. We will monitor postoperative pain levels along with PK and PD responses to the opioid fentanyl. We will assess group differences in post-operative pain as well as analgesic responses immediately for several hours post surgery and up to 3 days post-procedure. My objectives are designed to establish a foundation upon which to build an independent research career in clinically-relevant experimental neuroscience pain research. The proposed training and mentored research will ultimately enhance my understanding of biopsychosocial factors that contribute to health disparities. I propose 4 main training objectives: 1) Develop expertise in psychophysical and clinical pain assessment with emphasis on ethnic differences; 2) Gain an understanding of the complex genetic, PK/PD processes involved in post-operative pain and analgesic responses; 3) Increase knowledge in advanced biostatistical methodology; and 4) Improve understanding of factors related to ethnic differences acute pain and analgesia. My long-term career goal is to develop a programmatic line of research designed to elucidate biopsychosocial contributions to ethnic differences in pain. Eventually, I would engage in translational research to reduce health disparities in clinical pain through the development of interventions designed to enhance the quality of life of individuals with pain, consistent with the strategic plan of NINDS.          ",Ethnic Differences in Acute Pain and Analgesic Response,7795685,K01NS055094,"['Pharmacogenomics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Pain Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fentanyl ', ' Propanamide, N-phenyl-N-(1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl)- ', ' Phentanyl ', ' Fentyl ', ' Foundations ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Age ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Procedures ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' Visual ', ' National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ', ' NINDS ', ' Individual ', ' young adult ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' Opioid ', ' analog ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Drug Kinetics ', ' Pharmacokinetics ', ' Genetic ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' psychophysical ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Absence of pain sensation ', ' analgesia ', ' No sensitivity to pain ', ' Feels no pain ', ' Absence of sensibility to pain ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Knowledge ', ' Attention ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Pharmacodynamics ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' third molar extraction ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' clinically relevant ', ' clinical relevance ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K01,2010,167602,0.47021887062908685
"HIV-associated Neuropathy: Ethnic Disparities and Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minorities and women now account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections. Neuropathy is the most common neurologic complication of HIV, occurring in up to 60% of patients with advanced disease. Neuropathy is commonly painful and can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Recent clinical trials of treatment for neuropathic pain related to HIV have had disappointing results, raising the question of whether the study medications truly lack efficacy, or if the instruments used to measure pain were poorly suited to the population under study. Pilot data suggest there may be racial and ethnic differences in clinical manifestations of HIV-associated neuropathy, including pain. The goal of this project is to better define these differences and to explore their neuro-biologic and socio-cultural underpinnings. Specific aims are: 1. To determine whether there are differences between racial and ethnic groups in clinical and neurophysiologic features of HIV-associated neuropathy 2. To determine if commonly used pain scales adequately reflect the pain experience of minority, low-literacy patients with HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy (HIV-DSP) 3. To determine whether autonomic neuropathy (AN) is prevalent in HIV-positive minorities 4. To determine whether the characteristic peripheral nerve and skin biopsy pathology of HIV-DSP in the HAART-era varies with race or ethnicity Retrospective analyses will be performed on data collected by the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium and the CNS HIV Antiretroviral Effects Research Study. Going forward, predominantly minority patients will be recruited for detailed neurologic assessment including: administration of pain and symptom scales; detailed neurologic assessment and quantification of deficits using validated instruments; neurophysiologic testing (nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing and autonomic testing); and skin biopsy. Peripheral nerve pathology will be studied using autopsy specimens from the Manhattan HIV Brain Bank.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropathy is a common complication of HIV which significantly reduces quality of life, and for which there is no FDA-approved treatment. HIV now disproportionately affects minorities, so if effective treatments for neuropathy are to be developed, more information is needed about its clinical and pathologic manifestations in these populations, including the reporting of pain.           ",HIV-associated Neuropathy: Ethnic Disparities and Pathogenesis,7910480,K23NS066789,"['Skin ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Polyneuropathy ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Affect ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Goals ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurologic ', ' Neurological ', ' literacy ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' autonomic neuropathy ', ' Neural Conduction ', ' Nerve Conduction ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' instrument ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Hypersensitivity skin testing ', ' immunologic skin test ', ' hypersensitivity test ', ' Skin Tests ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Neuropathy ', ' neuropathic ', ' Sensory ', ' Biopsy ', ' experience ', ' immunopathology ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' advanced disease ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' Measures ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Accounting ', ' Complication ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' FDA approved ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' National NeuroAids Tissue Consortium ', ' NNTC ', ' ']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2010,170127,0.3691724212408785

"Racial disparities in pain experience: Neuroimaging and behavioral investigations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial disparities exist in access to and quality of health care treatment of pain (e.g. Todd et al., 1993 & 2000), a medical condition that affects more Americans than heart disease, diabetes, and cancer combined (CDC, 2006). Compared to Caucasian-Americans, African Americans experience clinical (Edwards et al., 2001) and experimental pain to a greater extent and with greater frequency, likely due to both genetic and environmental factors, and yet are more likely to be undertreated for pain in medical settings (Green et al., 2003; Bonham, 2001). Racial disparities in pain may result from both basic biological differences in how pain is experienced and perceived across racial groups as well as how the pain of different racial groups is perceived and treated in medical settings by healthcare professionals. First, African-Americans are more likely to suffer from acute and chronic pain that accompanies sickle cell disease, a genetic blood disorder characterized by the predominance of hemoglobin S (Hb S) arising from a known mutation of a single SNP of the 2-globin gene (Kwiatkowski, 2005). Second, due to these negative stereotypes, African-Americans typically encounter increased experience with racial discrimination or race-based social pain in interpersonal and work settings, which decreases health, increases mortality (Williams et al., 1997), and may lead to increased sensitivity to and experience of physical pain in this population. Third, racial stereotypes and prejudice can also affect perception and medical judgments of pain (Freeman & Payne, 2000, van Ryn & Burke, 2000), leading to under or inappropriate treatment of pain conditions particularly for African-Americans (Freeman & Payne, 2000). Finally, the potential difficulty or inability to readily receive appropriate medical treatment for pain can lead African-Americans to mistrust or avoid medical settings (Corbie-Smith, Thomas, St George, 2002) which may further exacerbate existing or emerging pain conditions and lead to persistent racial disparities in pain. The aim of the proposed series of neuroimaging and behavioral studies is to investigate the effect of race on the neural response to pain perception and experience, as well as whether racial stereotypes and prejudice affect how both doctors and lay people respond to the physical pain of others. Findings from the proposed research may have important implications for addressing the neurobiological and psychological mechanisms underlying population health disparities in pain experience and care across racial groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities exist in the experience and medical treatment of pain, a medical condition that affects more Americans than heart disease, diabetes, and cancer combined (CDC, 2006) (e.g. Todd et al., 1993 & 2000). The aim of the proposed series of studies is to investigate the effect of race on the neural response to physical pain perception and experience, and to examine the effects of racial stereotyping and prejudice on pain perception and diagnosis in a medical and non-medical setting.           Racial disparities exist in the experience and medical treatment of pain, a medical condition that affects more Americans than heart disease, diabetes, and cancer combined (CDC, 2006) (e.g. Todd et al., 1993 & 2000).

"Do Patient Requests Affect Doctor's Decisions? A Complementary Experimental and Q    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. healthcare environment has changed dramatically in the last several decades. Patients are increasingly knowledge-empowered (through internet access) and ""activated"" (through direct advertising) to seek care from physicians who are increasingly salaried employees in large medical settings (adhering to organizational priorities). ""Activated patients"" often suggest specific diagnoses to their primary care physicians. Some 30 percent now request specific medications (discovered on television or by internet searches) of which 40 percent receive the requested prescription. Using complementary research methods (factorial experimentation and rigorous qualitative research) we propose to: a) describe how different primary care physicians respond to specific prescription requests from different patients (factorial experiment); and b) explain the reasons why they do so (""think aloud"" qualitative techniques). Within a single, cost-efficient study, we propose two experiments focusing on common medical conditions (sciatica and osteoarthritis of the knee) which generate high levels of healthcare utilization, prescribing and costs, to address the following specific aims: 1. To estimate the independent influence of patient attributes on a physician's compliance with a request for a pain medication. Is a request from certain patients more likely to be successful? 2. To estimate the independent influence of provider characteristics on the diagnosis and management of the two pain conditions presented. Are certain physicians more likely to accede to a patient's request? 3. To understand the influence of healthcare system or organizational factors on prescribing and management. Does the size, ownership, practice setting or practice culture influence decisions? 4. A complementary qualitative component will identify the underlying cognitive reasoning processes that explain the observed variability in decisions uncovered by the experimental component of the study. Our findings will have implications for everyday clinical practice, healthcare policy and educational interventions designed to improve the quality of decision making. First, variability in the quality of care provided by primary care physicians for commonly presented pain is of widespread national concern. Second, the influence of patient requests on provider behavior remains poorly understood, but is likely to increase in the U.S. and elsewhere (DTCA of pharmaceuticals is about to be introduced throughout the countries of the European Union). Third, polypharmacy (especially pain medications) is of increasing concern in the US, particularly among older patients with multiple co-morbidities who often consult a range of specialists in addition to primary care providers. Fourth, moving from the description of healthcare variations (how?) to explanation of their cognitive origins (why?) marks a new direction in clinical decision making research and is a necessary pre-requisite for educational interventions. Public Health Relevance: We propose to use a factorial experiment to understand Clinical Decision Making (CDM) when activated patients make requests for a specific pain medication. The implications for a continual and rapid increase of direct to consumer advertising (by Internet, TV, and print), broadening health disparities in chronic pain management, and growing prevalence of chronic pain has significant health policy implications. This study aims to disentangle the patient (gender, race, SES) and physician factors (experience and gender) related to chronic pain management and opioid use, and underlying cognitive reasoning that produce the decisions we observe.                         7.

"Social and behavioral influences on clinical communication and pain management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to white patients with advanced cancer, black patients experience inferior pain control and less frequent and less effective discussions about symptoms, prognosis and treatment preferences. It is not clear the degree to which these differences are due to patient factors (e.g. asking fewer questions) or physician factors (e.g. implicit/unconscious racial bias, poor communication). Preliminary studies suggest that activating patients to be more assertive and to ask more questions during the visit can mitigate racial differences in communication and pain management. The proposed study addresses this critical question though a field experiment. Using novel standardized patient methodology, we will randomly assign black or white patients with identical cancer history and symptoms to primary care and oncology physicians to examine whether potentially mutable patient and physician behaviors (activation and patient-centered communication) might mitigate some of these racial differences, including those that are due to implicit biases. Aims: 1. To examine the magnitude of racial differences in physicians' assessment of pain, discussions about  prognosis and treatment choices, and use of guideline-concordant pain management. 2. To examine whether patient activation mitigates racial differences in physician communication behaviors  and pain management decisions. 3. To explore potential moderators of racial differences in physician communication behaviors and pain  management decisions, such as patient-centered communication and implicit unconscious bias. Methods: We will conduct a randomized experiment examining mutable patient and physician behaviors. We will create 4 unannounced standardized patient (SP, ""secret shopper"") roles portraying identical scenarios - a 70-year old patient with advanced cancer and uncontrolled pain - differing only by patient race (black/white) and level of activation (high/typical). We will randomly assign 120 physicians to see 2 unannounced covert SPs of the same race over a 12-month period, but differing according to activation. Outcome measures: We will transcribe and code audio-recorded physician-SP visits. We will code the depth of physician pain assessment using the Measure of Physician Pain Assessment, developed in our pilot (Cronbach's 1 = .68). We will assess prognosis and treatment choice communication using the Prognosis and Treatment Choices measure, which we developed in our pilot (Cronbach's 1 = 0.80). We found racial differences on both of these outcomes in our pilot. We will assess guideline-concordant pain medication recommendations using chart audit and review of transcripts. We will assess Exploring and Validating Concerns a component of patient-centered communication that has been associated with prescribing behavior, and the Implicit Associations Test, a measure of implicit bias to examine their moderating effects (Aim 3).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project will identify the degree to which racial disparities exist in physicians' communication with patients with advanced cancer with regard to pain control, prognosis and treatment choices. We will also study whether patients who are ""activated"" -- those who ask more questions and are more involved in their care -- experience fewer racial disparities. Results from this research will inform interventions for physicians and patients to promote better communication and thereby reduce or eliminate racial disparities in care.           Our project will identify the degree to which racial disparities exist in physicians' communication with patients with advanced cancer with regard to pain control, prognosis and treatment choices.

"Psycho-sociocultural factors influencing cancer pain management in elderly adults    DESCRIPTION (from applicant): Epidemiological evidence shows that elderly minority adults are less likely to have their cancer pain recorded, are at an increased risk for the misdiagnosis and under-treatment of their cancer pain, and report less relief or analgesic treatment for their pain. This project proposes two phases, a descriptive survey and an educational pain management intervention, to assess if such disparities are influenced by identified social, cultural, or psychological constructs. The primary objective for phase I (descriptive) is to elucidate existing social, cultural, and psychological sources that may influence the experience of cancer pain, satisfaction with cancer pain care and management in elderly Blacks and Whites diagnosed with lung, colon, breast, or prostate cancer. The aims to support this objective are to: 1) assess whether elderly Black and White cancer patients differ in social (discrimination, SES), cultural (cultural heritage, ethnic identity), and psychological (depression, physician mistrust, symptom distress) variables, and to determine if these factors serve as potential mediators explaining differential health outcomes, 2) determine the relationship between identified psychosocial and cultural factors, and 3) assess the utility of a proposed theoretical model in explaining individual differences in identified health outcome variables both within and between race groups of elderly cancer patients. Guided by phase I's conceptual model, the objective for phase II (intervention) is to: 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a cancer pain management education intervention among elderly Black and White cancer patients, and 2) evaluate patients' reactions to and satisfaction with the program, while identifying potential psychological, social, and cultural constructs that present as barriers to effective pain management. To date, we have identified no studies that have examined the impact identified psychosocial and cultural factors (e.g., discrimination, ethnic identity) have on optimal cancer pain management. In addition, there are few interventions designed to address these constructs as they relate to cancer pain care and management among the elderly. Examining these factors will prove pivotal in potentially reducing disparities and eliminating barriers to cancer pain care and management.           RELEVANCE (See instructions):  There is growing concen that minority cancer patients are less likely to have their cancer pain recorded,  report receiving less pain relief or analgesic treatment, and are at an increased risk for the misdiagnosis and  undertreatment of their cancer pain. There is a collective urgency to address these factors, and to implement  interventions that may assist in reducing these inequities and disparities, particularly among the elderly  patient.",Psycho-sociocultural factors influencing cancer pain management in elderly adults,8127907,K01CA131722,"['Psychological Factors ', ' post intervention ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Goals ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Participant ', ' Economics ', ' Phase ', ' Prevalence ', ' programs ', ' Health ', ' Risk ', ' Source ', ' Age ', ' Patients ', ' experience ', ' Knowledge ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Outcome ', ' base ', ' Research ', ' Physicians ', ' Mediating ', ' Sampling ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Population ', ' Measures ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Evaluation ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Reaction ', ' Address ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Individual Differences ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' psychosocial ', ' intervention program ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Perception ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Minority ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Gender ', ' satisfaction ', ' Caring ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' social ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Data ', ' Distress ', ' Mails ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Reporting ', ' Symptoms ', ' Instruction ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' older patient ', ' elderly patient ', ' Modeling ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Educational Materials ', ' racism ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' Social Discrimination ', ' Cancer Pain Management ', ' cancer pain ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,K01,2011,140069,0.3863339039134626
"HIV-associated Neuropathy: Ethnic Disparities and Pathogenesis    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minorities and women now account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections. Neuropathy is the most common neurologic complication of HIV, occurring in up to 60% of patients with advanced disease. Neuropathy is commonly painful and can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Recent clinical trials of treatment for neuropathic pain related to HIV have had disappointing results, raising the question of whether the study medications truly lack efficacy, or if the instruments used to measure pain were poorly suited to the population under study. Pilot data suggest there may be racial and ethnic differences in clinical manifestations of HIV-associated neuropathy, including pain. The goal of this project is to better define these differences and to explore their neuro-biologic and socio-cultural underpinnings. Specific aims are: 1. To determine whether there are differences between racial and ethnic groups in clinical and neurophysiologic features of HIV-associated neuropathy 2. To determine if commonly used pain scales adequately reflect the pain experience of minority, low-literacy patients with HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy (HIV-DSP) 3. To determine whether autonomic neuropathy (AN) is prevalent in HIV-positive minorities 4. To determine whether the characteristic peripheral nerve and skin biopsy pathology of HIV-DSP in the HAART-era varies with race or ethnicity Retrospective analyses will be performed on data collected by the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium and the CNS HIV Antiretroviral Effects Research Study. Going forward, predominantly minority patients will be recruited for detailed neurologic assessment including: administration of pain and symptom scales; detailed neurologic assessment and quantification of deficits using validated instruments; neurophysiologic testing (nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing and autonomic testing); and skin biopsy. Peripheral nerve pathology will be studied using autopsy specimens from the Manhattan HIV Brain Bank.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Neuropathy is a common complication of HIV which significantly reduces quality of life, and for which there is no FDA-approved treatment. HIV now disproportionately affects minorities, so if effective treatments for neuropathy are to be developed, more information is needed about its clinical and pathologic manifestations in these populations, including the reporting of pain.           Neuropathy is a common complication of HIV which significantly reduces quality of life, and for which there  is no FDA-approved treatment.

"Improving Functional Status in African Americans with Cancer Pain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pain is the most common and distressing symptom experienced by cancer patients and often lowers functional status. Our prior research showed that these disparities arise in part from a lower perception of control over pain. A great deal of clinical experience and research has shown that interventions need to be highly individualized and responsive to the rapidly-changing needs of patients with pain. Because of this, and with shorter hospital stays, patients and their caregivers are more than ever responsible for daily pain and symptom management. Unfortunately, they are not typically prepared for this responsibility. Including both patients and caregivers in interventions is essential since caregivers' beliefs directly affect pain management success. Our ultimate goal is to improve the function of diverse patients with chronic pain. To help cancer patients and caregivers effectively manage pain, we developed and tested a 1-session intervention that included medication management and pain advocacy content. That study showed the central role of perception of control over pain in self management. We are now expanding the intervention to include a third component called Living with Pain. The Living with Pain component is new in the cancer pain population where it can be helpful in maximizing function in spite of pain. We are also increasing the number and type of visits (dose) and providing continuous access for problem solving. Among cancer patients, African Americans report the highest levels of pain and symptom distress, and lower levels of function. Our prior research showed that these disparities arise in part from lower perceptions of control over pain. The new intervention, Power Over Pain - Coaching (POP-C), is tailored to the culture of African American cancer patients and their caregivers and individualized to the unique needs of each patient and caregiver. The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of the POP-C intervention to improve function among African American outpatients with cancer pain. This study will contribute significantly to the advancement of pain research by addressing a challenge of treatment that has remained unsolved for a traditionally under-represented minority. When shown to be effective, this intervention can then be adapted for other diverse populations with cancer-related pain or chronic non-cancer pain.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Social justice is the core value of the American public health system. African American cancer patients bear a disproportionate burden from pain and the resultant limitations in function. Excess morbidity from inadequately managed cancer pain in the African American community results in high levels of human suffering, increased family caregiver burdens, and both hidden and explicit economic costs. Effective nursing interventions such as the Power over Pain - Coaching program being tested in this study hold great promise for pain relief among individual cancer patients and their families while we work towards an end to the current systemic disparities in access, treatment, and outcomes.              Social justice is the core value of the American public health system.

"Social and behavioral influences on clinical communication and pain management    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to white patients with advanced cancer, black patients experience inferior pain control and less frequent and less effective discussions about symptoms, prognosis and treatment preferences. It is not clear the degree to which these differences are due to patient factors (e.g. asking fewer questions) or physician factors (e.g. implicit/unconscious racial bias, poor communication). Preliminary studies suggest that activating patients to be more assertive and to ask more questions during the visit can mitigate racial differences in communication and pain management. The proposed study addresses this critical question though a field experiment. Using novel standardized patient methodology, we will randomly assign black or white patients with identical cancer history and symptoms to primary care and oncology physicians to examine whether potentially mutable patient and physician behaviors (activation and patient-centered communication) might mitigate some of these racial differences, including those that are due to implicit biases. Aims: 1. To examine the magnitude of racial differences in physicians' assessment of pain, discussions about  prognosis and treatment choices, and use of guideline-concordant pain management. 2. To examine whether patient activation mitigates racial differences in physician communication behaviors  and pain management decisions. 3. To explore potential moderators of racial differences in physician communication behaviors and pain  management decisions, such as patient-centered communication and implicit unconscious bias. Methods: We will conduct a randomized experiment examining mutable patient and physician behaviors. We will create 4 unannounced standardized patient (SP, ""secret shopper"") roles portraying identical scenarios - a 70-year old patient with advanced cancer and uncontrolled pain - differing only by patient race (black/white) and level of activation (high/typical). We will randomly assign 120 physicians to see 2 unannounced covert SPs of the same race over a 12-month period, but differing according to activation. Outcome measures: We will transcribe and code audio-recorded physician-SP visits. We will code the depth of physician pain assessment using the Measure of Physician Pain Assessment, developed in our pilot (Cronbach's 1 = .68). We will assess prognosis and treatment choice communication using the Prognosis and Treatment Choices measure, which we developed in our pilot (Cronbach's 1 = 0.80). We found racial differences on both of these outcomes in our pilot. We will assess guideline-concordant pain medication recommendations using chart audit and review of transcripts. We will assess Exploring and Validating Concerns a component of patient-centered communication that has been associated with prescribing behavior, and the Implicit Associations Test, a measure of implicit bias to examine their moderating effects (Aim 3).      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project will identify the degree to which racial disparities exist in physicians' communication with patients with advanced cancer with regard to pain control, prognosis and treatment choices. We will also study whether patients who are ""activated"" -- those who ask more questions and are more involved in their care -- experience fewer racial disparities.

"HIV-associated Neuropathy: Ethnic Disparities and Pathogenesis Minorities and women now account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections. Neuropathy is the  most common neurologic complication of HIV, occurring in up to 60% of patients with advanced disease.  Neuropathy is commonly painful and can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Recent clinical  trials of treatment for neuropathic pain related to HIV have had disappointing results, raising the question of  whether the study medications truly lack efficacy, or if the instruments used to measure pain were poorly  suited to the population under study. Pilot data suggest there may be racial and ethnic differences in clinical  manifestations of HIV-associated neuropathy, including pain. The goal of this project is to better define  these differences and to explore their neuro-biologic and socio-cultural underpinnings. Specific aims are:    1. To determine whether there are differences between racial and ethnic groups in clinical and  neurophysiologic features of HIV-associated neuropathy  2. To determine if commonly used pain scales adequately reflect the pain experience of minority,  low-literacy patients with HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy (HIV-DSP)  3. To determine whether autonomic neuropathy (AN) is prevalent in HIV-positive minorities  4. To determine whether the characteristic peripheral nerve and skin biopsy pathology of HIV-DSP in the  HAART-era varies with race or ethnicity    Retrospective analyses will be performed on data collected by the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium  and the CNS HIV Antiretroviral Effects Research Study. Going forward, predominantly minority patients will  be recruited for detailed neurologic assessment including: administration of pain and symptom scales;  detailed neurologic assessment and quantification of deficits using validated instruments; neurophysiologic  testing (nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing and autonomic testing); and skin biopsy.  Peripheral nerve pathology will be studied using autopsy specimens from the Manhattan HIV Brain Bank. Neuropathy is a common complication of HIV which significantly reduces quality of life, and for which there  is no FDA-approved treatment. HIV now disproportionately affects minorities, so if effective treatments for  neuropathy are to be developed, more information is needed about its clinical and pathologic manifestations  in these populations, including the reporting of pain.",HIV-associated Neuropathy: Ethnic Disparities and Pathogenesis,8303342,K23NS066789,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Biopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' literacy ', ' Nerve Conduction ', ' Neural Conduction ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Polyneuropathy ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' autonomic neuropathy ', ' neuroAIDS ', ' AIDS neuropathy ', ' instrument ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' Sensory ', ' experience ', ' immunopathology ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' advanced disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' Skin ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' FDA approved ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2012,175645,0.3691724212408785
"Everyday Quality of Life in Blacks and Whites with Osteoarthritis     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research examines relationships among pain, everyday activities and mood states, and long-term quality of life among African American (AA; Black) and non-Hispanic White (NHW; White) older adults with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Recent evidence suggests considerable divergence in the experience and effects of this potentially very debilitating disorder among AAs and NHWs. Unfortunately, there has been little in-depth research on racial/ethnic (R/E) differences previous work on racial/ethnic (R/E) disparities in basic experience of OA symptoms, and in the emotional impact of those symptoms and related disability. This research addresses that gap in a longitudinal study of OA pain, functional disability and emotional well-being of AAs and NHWs. Working from a biopsychosocial model, we shall use functional assessments, self-reports, and real-time assessments of activities, symptoms and mood states to construct a comprehensive view of how OA affects physical and emotional functioning. Specific aims are (1) to describe racial/ethnic differences in associations among pain, disability, and emotional well-being of persons with OA of the knee; (2) to identify origins of those differences in (a) biological factors such as disease process and general health, (b) social factors such as demographic characteristics, and (ii) psychological factors, including stable personal characteristics and transitory (within-day) affective, cognitive and behavioral responses to knee symptoms; (3) to use experience sampling methods (ESM) and actigraphy to investigate how racial/ethnic differences in global associations among pain, functional limitations and emotional distress are reflected in the daily lives of OA sufferers, and (4) to explore how the interplay of transitory (within-day) symptoms, activities and mood states influences long-term physical and emotional well-being. These aims will be achieved in a 5-year, multi- site project examining cross-sectional and longitudinal associations among demographic and health characteristics, OA-related pain and disability, restriction of everyday activities, and emotional well-being. A sample of 220 AA and 220 NHW adults aged 50+ with physician-diagnosed OA of the knee will complete a comprehensive baseline assessment tapping biological, psychological and social vulnerability to OA pain and its effects; objective functional limitations; pain; activity restriction, and emotiona distress. Immediately post- baseline, participants will complete a 7-day ESM procedure comprising actigraphic assessment of activity levels along with 4 daily telephone contacts to assess current symptoms, activities, and moods. One year later, participants will repeat all measures, including the ESM component, to capture changes in overall physical and emotional well-being as well as patterns of daily activity and moods. Resulting data will offer unprecedented insight into the global factors that differentiate AAs' and NHWs' experience of OA symptoms, and how daily experiences are concatenated to influence longer-term physical and emotional well-being.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic illness and the leading cause of pain and disability among older adults. As the population ages, prevalence of OA is rising sharply; this, in turn, portends rising rates of disability and health care costs. Osteoarthritis's characteristic pain and functional limitations place persons at increased risk of significant emotional distress; that distress may, in turn, fuel OA pain and hasten functional decline. There are clear differences in the epidemiology of OA among African American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) older adults, but surprisingly little is known about racial/ethnic disparities in the functional and emotional effects of OA. This study fills that gap by examining how OA of the knee affects everyday activities and emotional well-being of older AAs and NHWs, and how those effects change over a one-year period.              Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic illness and the leading cause of pain and disability among older adults.

"Do Patient Requests Affect Doctor's Decisions? A Complementary Experimental and Q    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The U.S. healthcare environment has changed dramatically in the last several decades. Patients are increasingly knowledge-empowered (through internet access) and ""activated"" (through direct advertising) to seek care from physicians who are increasingly salaried employees in large medical settings (adhering to organizational priorities). ""Activated patients"" often suggest specific diagnoses to their primary care physicians. Some 30 percent now request specific medications (discovered on television or by internet searches) of which 40 percent receive the requested prescription. Using complementary research methods (factorial experimentation and rigorous qualitative research) we propose to: a) describe how different primary care physicians respond to specific prescription requests from different patients (factorial experiment); and b) explain the reasons why they do so (""think aloud"" qualitative techniques). Within a single, cost-efficient study, we propose two experiments focusing on common medical conditions (sciatica and osteoarthritis of the knee) which generate high levels of healthcare utilization, prescribing and costs, to address the following specific aims: 1. To estimate the independent influence of patient attributes on a physician's compliance with a request for a pain medication. Is a request from certain patients more likely to be successful? 2. To estimate the independent influence of provider characteristics on the diagnosis and management of the two pain conditions presented. Are certain physicians more likely to accede to a patient's request? 3. To understand the influence of healthcare system or organizational factors on prescribing and management. Does the size, ownership, practice setting or practice culture influence decisions? 4. A complementary qualitative component will identify the underlying cognitive reasoning processes that explain the observed variability in decisions uncovered by the experimental component of the study. Our findings will have implications for everyday clinical practice, healthcare policy and educational interventions designed to improve the quality of decision making. First, variability in the quality of care provided by primary care physicians for commonly presented pain is of widespread national concern. Second, the influence of patient requests on provider behavior remains poorly understood, but is likely to increase in the U.S. and elsewhere (DTCA of pharmaceuticals is about to be introduced throughout the countries of the European Union). Third, polypharmacy (especially pain medications) is of increasing concern in the US, particularly among older patients with multiple co-morbidities who often consult a range of specialists in addition to primary care providers. Fourth, moving from the description of healthcare variations (how?) to explanation of their cognitive origins (why?) marks a new direction in clinical decision making research and is a necessary pre-requisite for educational interventions. Public Health Relevance: We propose to use a factorial experiment to understand Clinical Decision Making (CDM) when activated patients make requests for a specific pain medication. The implications for a continual and rapid increase of direct to consumer advertising (by Internet, TV, and print), broadening health disparities in chronic pain management, and growing prevalence of chronic pain has significant health policy implications. This study aims to disentangle the patient (gender, race, SES) and physician factors (experience and gender) related to chronic pain management and opioid use, and underlying cognitive reasoning that produce the decisions we observe.                         7.

"Improving Functional Status in African Americans with Cancer Pain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pain is the most common and distressing symptom experienced by cancer patients and often lowers functional status. Our prior research showed that these disparities arise in part from a lower perception of control over pain. A great deal of clinical experience and research has shown that interventions need to be highly individualized and responsive to the rapidly-changing needs of patients with pain. Because of this, and with shorter hospital stays, patients and their caregivers are more than ever responsible for daily pain and symptom management. Unfortunately, they are not typically prepared for this responsibility. Including both patients and caregivers in interventions is essential since caregivers' beliefs directly affect pain management success. Our ultimate goal is to improve the function of diverse patients with chronic pain. To help cancer patients and caregivers effectively manage pain, we developed and tested a 1-session intervention that included medication management and pain advocacy content. That study showed the central role of perception of control over pain in self management. We are now expanding the intervention to include a third component called Living with Pain. The Living with Pain component is new in the cancer pain population where it can be helpful in maximizing function in spite of pain. We are also increasing the number and type of visits (dose) and providing continuous access for problem solving. Among cancer patients, African Americans report the highest levels of pain and symptom distress, and lower levels of function. Our prior research showed that these disparities arise in part from lower perceptions of control over pain. The new intervention, Power Over Pain - Coaching (POP-C), is tailored to the culture of African American cancer patients and their caregivers and individualized to the unique needs of each patient and caregiver. The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of the POP-C intervention to improve function among African American outpatients with cancer pain. This study will contribute significantly to the advancement of pain research by addressing a challenge of treatment that has remained unsolved for a traditionally under-represented minority. When shown to be effective, this intervention can then be adapted for other diverse populations with cancer-related pain or chronic non-cancer pain.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Social justice is the core value of the American public health system. African American cancer patients bear a disproportionate burden from pain and the resultant limitations in function. Excess morbidity from inadequately managed cancer pain in the African American community results in high levels of human suffering, increased family caregiver burdens, and both hidden and explicit economic costs. Effective nursing interventions such as the Power over Pain - Coaching program being tested in this study hold great promise for pain relief among individual cancer patients and their families while we work towards an end to the current systemic disparities in access, treatment, and outcomes.

"Yoga vs. Physical Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain in Minority Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects 5-10% of U.S. adults annually and disproportionately impacts individuals from minority and low income backgrounds due to disparities in access and treatment. Pilot data collected at one of the proposed study sites demonstrate yoga is a feasible and possibly effective intervention for CLBP in minority populations. Evidence from multiple studies supports a moderate benefit in CLBP for exercise therapy individually-delivered by a physical therapist. Moreover, physical therapy is the most common, reimbursed, non-pharmacologic treatment recommended by physicians for CLBP. Our primary study objective is to compare the effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for the treatment of CLBP in a predominantly low income minority population. A 12 week comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial for CLBP is proposed with three treatment arms: (1) A standardized weekly hatha yoga protocol delivered in a class format; (2) a standardized evidence-based exercise therapy protocol individually delivered by a physical therapist; and (3) education delivered through a self-care book. A racially diverse population of 260 adults with CLBP will be recruited from Boston Medical Center and six affiliated community health centers and randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to yoga, physical therapy, and education, respectively. The application's primary aim is to determine the comparative effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for three outcomes at 12 weeks: pain intensity, back-specific function, and use of pain medication. For each of these outcomes, patients randomized to the yoga group are hypothesized to demonstrate clinically and statistically greater improvements than patients in the physical therapy or education groups. After the 12 week intervention period, half of the yoga and physical therapy participants will be randomly selected to participate in a 40 week ongoing structured yoga or physical therapy maintenance program. Pain, function, and pain medication use will be compared between maintenance and non-maintenance groups. Cost and utilization data will also be collected so cost effectiveness analyses from the perspective of society, the third party payer, and the patient can be performed. Together, results from these studies will help determine whether it is justifiable for yoga, currently a ""complementary"" therapy, to become an acceptable ""mainstream"" treatment for chronic low back pain. 1   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic low back pain is a substantial cause of suffering, disability, and cost in U.S. society. Individuals from low income minority backgrounds may be more affected by chronic low back pain due to disparities in health care access and treatment. Our study will compare the effectiveness of yoga to physical therapy for the treatment of chronic low back pain in 260 racially diverse adults recruited from urban community health centers. 1              Project Narrative Chronic low back pain is a substantial cause of suffering, disability, and cost in U.S. society.

"Management of Post Operative Pain in Underserved Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of the over five million children who undergo surgery in the United States, it is estimated that up to 65% will experience significant pain while in hospital and later at home. Over the past decade outpatient surgery has become much more prevalent and as a result the burden of managing postoperative pain at home falls mostly on the parents. Unfortunately, a number of studies by our laboratory as well as others indicate that many children's pain after surgery is significantly undertreated in home settings. Understanding the role of ethnicity and culture in the experience of postoperative pain at home settings is of particular importance when one considers that nearly 25% of children under the age of 5 in the United States are Hispanic. In adults, the existence of ethnic differences in perception, assessment, and treatment across settings and types of pain is well established. Indeed, the Institute of Medicine has recommended that the investigation of the sources of ethnic disparities in pain management and potential intervention strategies be a research priority. At the current time there is significant paucity of studies or interventions in this area in children. Our laboratry has demonstrated that parents of children of Hispanic origin with low socioeconomic status (SES) are significantly more likely to have misconceptions about pain management and after undergoing surgery these children are significantly more likely to receive less analgesics while at home. As a next step, we submit the need to understand the barriers for pain management in this unique population and next develop a specific intervention. The goal of this R21 application is to identify barriers to postoperative pain management in children of Hispanic origin of low SES. The study will employ both quantitative and qualitative approaches. In a follow up R01 investigation, we plan to develop and test a tailored intervention that will be directed at this underserved population. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: At the conclusion of the study, we will have identified specific barriers to pain management at home in an underserved population. Additionally, this information will allow us to develop a data-driven intervention that will improv the present disparity in pain management of Hispanic children at home.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The present study seeks to identify the sources of ethnic disparities in pain management after surgery among children of Hispanic origin of low SES. Understanding potential barriers (i.e., misconceptions, miscommunication, cultural values) will allow us to develop in a follow up application an innovative, evidence- based, culturally-tailored intervention that will address these barriers to successful pain management.              At the conclusion of the study, we will have identified specific barriers to pain management at home in an underserved population.

"Racial disparities in pain experience: Neuroimaging and behavioral investigations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Racial disparities exist in access to and quality of health care treatment of pain (e.g. Todd et al., 1993 & 2000), a medical condition that affects more Americans than heart disease, diabetes, and cancer combined (CDC, 2006). Compared to Caucasian-Americans, African Americans experience clinical (Edwards et al., 2001) and experimental pain to a greater extent and with greater frequency, likely due to both genetic and environmental factors, and yet are more likely to be undertreated for pain in medical settings (Green et al., 2003; Bonham, 2001). Racial disparities in pain may result from both basic biological differences in how pain is experienced and perceived across racial groups as well as how the pain of different racial groups is perceived and treated in medical settings by healthcare professionals. First, African-Americans are more likely to suffer from acute and chronic pain that accompanies sickle cell disease, a genetic blood disorder characterized by the predominance of hemoglobin S (Hb S) arising from a known mutation of a single SNP of the 2-globin gene (Kwiatkowski, 2005). Second, due to these negative stereotypes, African-Americans typically encounter increased experience with racial discrimination or race-based social pain in interpersonal and work settings, which decreases health, increases mortality (Williams et al., 1997), and may lead to increased sensitivity to and experience of physical pain in this population. Third, racial stereotypes and prejudice can also affect perception and medical judgments of pain (Freeman & Payne, 2000, van Ryn & Burke, 2000), leading to under or inappropriate treatment of pain conditions particularly for African-Americans (Freeman & Payne, 2000). Finally, the potential difficulty or inability to readily receive appropriate medical treatment for pain can lead African-Americans to mistrust or avoid medical settings (Corbie-Smith, Thomas, St George, 2002) which may further exacerbate existing or emerging pain conditions and lead to persistent racial disparities in pain. The aim of the proposed series of neuroimaging and behavioral studies is to investigate the effect of race on the neural response to pain perception and experience, as well as whether racial stereotypes and prejudice affect how both doctors and lay people respond to the physical pain of others. Findings from the proposed research may have important implications for addressing the neurobiological and psychological mechanisms underlying population health disparities in pain experience and care across racial groups.        Racial disparities exist in the experience and medical treatment of pain, a medical condition that affects more Americans than heart disease, diabetes, and cancer combined (CDC, 2006) (e.g. Todd et al., 1993 & 2000). The aim of the proposed series of studies is to investigate the effect of race on the neural response to physical pain perception and experience, and to examine the effects of racial stereotyping and prejudice on pain perception and diagnosis in a medical and non-medical setting.

"Psycho-sociocultural factors influencing cancer pain management in elderly adults Epidemiological evidence shows that elderly minority adults are less likely to have their cancer pain  recorded, are at an increased risk for the misdiagnosis and under-treatment of their cancer pain, and report   less relief or analgesic treatment for their pain. This project proposes two phases, a descriptive survey and  an educational pain management intervention, to assess if such disparities are influenced by identified  social, cultural, or psychological constructs. The primary objective for phase I (descriptive) is to elucidate  existing social, cultural, and psychological sources that may influence the experience of cancer pain,  satisfaction with cancer pain care and management in elderly Blacks and Whites diagnosed with lung, colon,  breast, or prostate cancer. The aims to support this objective are to: 1) assess whether elderly Black and  White cancer patients differ in social (discrimination, SES), cultural (cultural heritage, ethnic identity), and  psychological (depression, physician mistrust, symptom distress) variables, and to determine if these factors  serve as potential mediators explaining differential health outcomes, 2) determine the relationship between  identified psychosocial and cultural factors, and 3) assess the utility of a proposed theoretical model in  explaining individual differences in identified health outcome variables both within and between race groups  of elderly cancer patients. Guided by phase I's conceptual model, the objective for phase II (intervention) is  to: 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a cancer pain management education intervention among  elderly Black and White cancer patients, and 2) evaluate patients' reactions to and satisfaction with the  program, while identifying potential psychological, social, and cultural constructs that present as barriers to  effective pain management. To date, we have identified no studies that have examined the impact identified  psychosocial and cultural factors (e.g., discrimination, ethnic identity) have on optimal cancer pain  management. In addition, there are few interventions designed to address these constructs as they relate to  cancer pain care and management among the elderly. Examining these factors will prove pivotal in  potentially reducing disparities and eliminating barriers to cancer pain care and management. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  There is growing concen that minority cancer patients are less likely to have their cancer pain recorded,  report receiving less pain relief or analgesic treatment, and are at an increased risk for the misdiagnosis and  undertreatment of their cancer pain. There is a collective urgency to address these factors, and to implement  interventions that may assist in reducing these inequities and disparities, particularly among the elderly  patient.",Psycho-sociocultural factors influencing cancer pain management in elderly adults,8323936,K01CA131722,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Mails ', ' Theoretic Models ', ' Theoretical model ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk ', ' Social Discrimination ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' racism ', ' Evaluation ', ' Distress ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' satisfaction ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Cancer Pain Management ', ' Reaction ', ' Source ', ' psychosocial ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' intervention program ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' Colonic Carcinoma ', ' Colon Cancer ', ' Colon Carcinoma ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Educational Materials ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' post intervention ', ' Instruction ', ' Minority ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' Pain intensity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA,K01,2012,140069,0.3863339039134626
"Native American Pain Disparities: Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences 7.0. Project Summary/Abstract Native Americans (NAs) have a higher prevalence of pain than non-Hispanic whites and other U.S. minority groups. Yet, there is a lack of pain research in NAs, with only 28 papers on pain published in over 30 years. Moreover, no study has assessed pain processing to identify whether pain sensitivity (conscious pain experience), central sensitization (augmented pain signaling in the CNS), and/or CNS pain inhibition (descending pain modulation) contribute to this disparity. Our pilot data indicate that relative to non-Hispanic whites, NAs have lower pain sensitivity (e.g., higher pain tolerance) and show reduced central sensitization (reduced CNS response to pain) on a physiological measure (i.e., temporal summation of the nociceptive flexion reflex). This suggests their CNS responds differently to noxious input, which could have significant clinical implications. Specifically, being less pain sensitive may place NAs at risk for chronic pain because they could have difficulty detecting and preventing tissue damage and/or protecting tissue damage once it has occurred. However, results from these pilot data need to be replicated in a larger sample. Aim 1 will be to determine whether healthy, pain-free Native Americans (n=120) have lowered pain sensitivity, reduced central sensitization, and enhanced pain inhibitory processes relative to a non-Hispanic white control group (n=120). Testing will occur across two sessions using well-validated, state-of-the-art, quantitative sensory testing methods to assess pain processing from subjective (e.g., pain report) and physiological (nociceptive flexion reflex) pain outcomes. Pain sensitivity will be comprehensively assessed from pain threshold, tolerance, and report in response to multiple stimulus modalities (heat, cold, mechanical pressure, ischemia, electrocutaneous). Central sensitization will be assessed from: 1) temporal summation of heat pain (a subjective measure of sensitization), 2) nociceptive flexion reflex threshold (NFR, a physiological measure of spinal nociception), and 3) temporal summation of NFR (a physiological measure of spinal cord hyperexcitability). CNS inhibition of pain and NFR will be assessed from: 1) conditioned pain modulation (i.e., pain inhibits pain) and 2) emotional controls of nociception (i.e., pleasant emotions inhibit pain, unpleasant emotions enhance pain). Aim 2 is to identify individual differences that contribute to altered pain processing in NAs. Thus, pain coping (e.g., pain catastrophizing), sociocultural variables (e.g., ethnic identity), and heredity (i.e., blood quantu level) will be examined to determine whether they are associated with group differences in pain. This research is expected to impact minority health disparities in at least 5 ways: 1) identify mechanisms contributing to pain disparities in NAs, 2) determine if pain disparities in NAs result from physiological processes (e.g., CNS pain inhibition), 3) provide evidence that pain risk is physiologically different in NAs thus identifying the need for tailored interventions, 4) inform methods to assess NAs at-risk for chronic pain, and 5) promote interventions to eliminate pain disparity in NAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Native Americans have a high prevalence of chronic pain. To identify mechanisms contributing to this disparity, the current study will compare healthy, pain-free, Native Americans and non-Hispanic whites on well- validated measures of pain sensitivity (conscious pain experience), central sensitization (augmented CNS pain signaling), and CNS pain inhibition (mechanisms that regulate pain). Analyses will also examine whether group differences in pain are associated with coping style, socioculture, and/or heredity. Information obtained will inform: treatment interventions to reduce pain disparity and methods to screen at-risk individuals.            ",Native American Pain Disparities: Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences,8484318,R01MD007807,"['abstracting ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Control Groups ', ' Emotions ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' Heredity ', ' Ischemia ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Paper ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' pressure ', ' Publishing ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Reflex ', ' Reflex action ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' Injury ', ' exhaust ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' Stimulus ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Native Americans ', ' Reaction ', ' Sensory ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Spinal ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' experience ', ' mechanical pressure ', ' Participant ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Pain-Free ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Economic Burden ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Pain Research ', ' Process ', ' minority health ', ' productivity loss ', ' Minority ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' central sensitization ', ' inhibit pain ', ' pain inhibition ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,R01,2013,301928,0.5203472507924157
"Adherence in African Americans Being Treated for Cancer Pain    African Americans experience a disproportionate burden of cancer pain, suffer worse treatment outcomes, and have overall poor adherence to pain medication. Unfortunately, past research on pain has not fully explored factors important to cancer pain relief and treatment adherence in an economically diverse group of African Americans. Knowledge of the reasons why individuals do not adhere to pain treatment is essential if we are to better understand why they receive inadequate pain relief when adequate treatments are available. The proposed application moves beyond previous understanding of adherence by exploring the context of individuals - the social network and neighborhood that surround them and influence their behavior. This examination of social contextual factors requires a mixed method multilevel approach to explore the ""what"" and ""how"" of opiate adherence. Framed in a social ecological model, the aims of this study are to examine the influence of individual (symptom profile including pain and depression, pain beliefs, education, and gender) interpersonal (religious and social support), and neighborhood factors (socioeconomic measures, segregation, and drug related crime) on ""around the clock"" opiate adherence in African Americans being treated for cancer pain. A parallel mixed method design approach will be used that includes a quantitative and qualitative strand. The quantitative strand will provide information on what factors influence opiate adherence and the qualitative strand will provide a rich description of how these factors affect adherence. Along with the execution of this research, a comprehensive training and career mentoring plan will be carried out at Emory University under the mentorship of experts in symptom outcomes, pain disparities, medication adherence, and community factors of sociodemographic outcomes of health. The candidate's training goals include: 1) develop expertise in mixed- method research focusing on a minority sample being treated for cancer pain; 2) acquire methodological skills in geospatial analysis and statistics in order to better understand sources of disparities in non-adherence to opiates; and 3) build skills to position for next steps in the research trajectory. The goal of this project is to enhance understanding of pain medication adherence in African Americans. The long-range goal is to identify effective mechanisms to improve cancer pain relief, especially for those suffering the highest burden of cancer, African Americans. This training grant will prepare the candidate to be a successful independent researcher with preliminary information to improve pain management through treatment/assessment recommendations and/or patient and community interventions to ultimately improve pain management in African Americans with cancer pain. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience a disproportionate burden of cancer pain, suffer worse treatment outcomes, and have overall poor adherence to pain medication. The proposed study will examine individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood factors of opiate adherence for an economically diverse sample of AAs with cancer pain. Knowledge of the reasons why individuals do not adhere to pain treatment is essential if we are to better understand why they receive inadequate pain relief when adequate treatments are available. The overall project goal is to enhance understanding of pain medication adherence. It will also provide preliminary information on which to base treatment/assessment recommendations and/or patient and community interventions to improve cancer pain management in African Americans.            ",Adherence in African Americans Being Treated for Cancer Pain  ,8618009,K01NR014673,"['Affect ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Crime ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' geographic site ', ' MeSH Descriptors Class 4 ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Household Heads ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Household ', ' indexing ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Persons ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Poverty ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' statistics ', ' Time ', ' unemployed ', ' out of work ', ' joblessness ', ' jobless ', ' Unemployment ', ' Universities ', ' Vacuum ', ' Friends ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' segregation ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' career ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Individual ', ' Acquaintances ', ' Opiates ', ' Knowledge ', ' Cancer Pain Management ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Church ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' advanced disease ', ' novel ', ' economic cost ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' caregiver stress ', ' care giver stress ', ' Care giver Burden ', ' Caregiver Burden ', ' acquired immunodeficiency syndrome clinical trial group ', ' acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) clinical trial group ', ' ACTG ', ' AACTG - adult AIDS clinical trial group ', ' AACTG ', ' AIDS clinical trial group ', ' therapy cooperation ', ' therapy compliance ', ' patient adherence ', ' compliance cooperation ', ' Treatment Compliance ', ' Patient Cooperation ', ' Patient Compliance ', ' Compliance behavior ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Monitor ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' family influence ', ' public health relevance ', ' treatment adherence ', ' ']",NINR,EMORY UNIVERSITY,K01,2013,91761,0.43956114825351633
"Yoga vs. Physical Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain in Minority Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects 5-10% of U.S. adults annually and disproportionately impacts individuals from minority and low income backgrounds due to disparities in access and treatment. Pilot data collected at one of the proposed study sites demonstrate yoga is a feasible and possibly effective intervention for CLBP in minority populations. Evidence from multiple studies supports a moderate benefit in CLBP for exercise therapy individually-delivered by a physical therapist. Moreover, physical therapy is the most common, reimbursed, non-pharmacologic treatment recommended by physicians for CLBP. Our primary study objective is to compare the effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for the treatment of CLBP in a predominantly low income minority population. A 12 week comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial for CLBP is proposed with three treatment arms: (1) A standardized weekly hatha yoga protocol delivered in a class format; (2) a standardized evidence-based exercise therapy protocol individually delivered by a physical therapist; and (3) education delivered through a self-care book. A racially diverse population of 260 adults with CLBP will be recruited from Boston Medical Center and six affiliated community health centers and randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to yoga, physical therapy, and education, respectively. The application's primary aim is to determine the comparative effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for three outcomes at 12 weeks: pain intensity, back-specific function, and use of pain medication. For each of these outcomes, patients randomized to the yoga group are hypothesized to demonstrate clinically and statistically greater improvements than patients in the physical therapy or education groups. After the 12 week intervention period, half of the yoga and physical therapy participants will be randomly selected to participate in a 40 week ongoing structured yoga or physical therapy maintenance program. Pain, function, and pain medication use will be compared between maintenance and non-maintenance groups. Cost and utilization data will also be collected so cost effectiveness analyses from the perspective of society, the third party payer, and the patient can be performed. Together, results from these studies will help determine whether it is justifiable for yoga, currently a ""complementary"" therapy, to become an acceptable ""mainstream"" treatment for chronic low back pain. 1   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic low back pain is a substantial cause of suffering, disability, and cost in U.S. society. Individuals from low income minority backgrounds may be more affected by chronic low back pain due to disparities in health care access and treatment. Our study will compare the effectiveness of yoga to physical therapy for the treatment of chronic low back pain in 260 racially diverse adults recruited from urban community health centers. 1              Project Narrative Chronic low back pain is a substantial cause of suffering, disability, and cost in U.S. society.

"Psycho-sociocultural factors influencing cancer pain management in elderly adults Epidemiological evidence shows that elderly minority adults are less likely to have their cancer pain  recorded, are at an increased risk for the misdiagnosis and under-treatment of their cancer pain, and report   less relief or analgesic treatment for their pain. This project proposes two phases, a descriptive survey and  an educational pain management intervention, to assess if such disparities are influenced by identified  social, cultural, or psychological constructs. The primary objective for phase I (descriptive) is to elucidate  existing social, cultural, and psychological sources that may influence the experience of cancer pain,  satisfaction with cancer pain care and management in elderly Blacks and Whites diagnosed with lung, colon,  breast, or prostate cancer. The aims to support this objective are to: 1) assess whether elderly Black and  White cancer patients differ in social (discrimination, SES), cultural (cultural heritage, ethnic identity), and  psychological (depression, physician mistrust, symptom distress) variables, and to determine if these factors  serve as potential mediators explaining differential health outcomes, 2) determine the relationship between  identified psychosocial and cultural factors, and 3) assess the utility of a proposed theoretical model in  explaining individual differences in identified health outcome variables both within and between race groups  of elderly cancer patients. Guided by phase I's conceptual model, the objective for phase II (intervention) is  to: 1) determine the feasibility and acceptability of a cancer pain management education intervention among  elderly Black and White cancer patients, and 2) evaluate patients' reactions to and satisfaction with the  program, while identifying potential psychological, social, and cultural constructs that present as barriers to  effective pain management. To date, we have identified no studies that have examined the impact identified  psychosocial and cultural factors (e.g., discrimination, ethnic identity) have on optimal cancer pain  management. In addition, there are few interventions designed to address these constructs as they relate to  cancer pain care and management among the elderly. Examining these factors will prove pivotal in  potentially reducing disparities and eliminating barriers to cancer pain care and management. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  There is growing concen that minority cancer patients are less likely to have their cancer pain recorded,  report receiving less pain relief or analgesic treatment, and are at an increased risk for the misdiagnosis and  undertreatment of their cancer pain.

"Management of Post Operative Pain in Underserved Populations     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of the over five million children who undergo surgery in the United States, it is estimated that up to 65% will experience significant pain while in hospital and later at home. Over the past decade outpatient surgery has become much more prevalent and as a result the burden of managing postoperative pain at home falls mostly on the parents. Unfortunately, a number of studies by our laboratory as well as others indicate that many children's pain after surgery is significantly undertreated in home settings. Understanding the role of ethnicity and culture in the experience of postoperative pain at home settings is of particular importance when one considers that nearly 25% of children under the age of 5 in the United States are Hispanic. In adults, the existence of ethnic differences in perception, assessment, and treatment across settings and types of pain is well established. Indeed, the Institute of Medicine has recommended that the investigation of the sources of ethnic disparities in pain management and potential intervention strategies be a research priority. At the current time there is significant paucity of studies or interventions in this area in children. Our laboratry has demonstrated that parents of children of Hispanic origin with low socioeconomic status (SES) are significantly more likely to have misconceptions about pain management and after undergoing surgery these children are significantly more likely to receive less analgesics while at home. As a next step, we submit the need to understand the barriers for pain management in this unique population and next develop a specific intervention. The goal of this R21 application is to identify barriers to postoperative pain management in children of Hispanic origin of low SES. The study will employ both quantitative and qualitative approaches. In a follow up R01 investigation, we plan to develop and test a tailored intervention that will be directed at this underserved population.   At the conclusion of the study, we will have identified specific barriers to pain management at home in an underserved population. Additionally, this information will allow us to develop a data-driven intervention that will improv the present disparity in pain management of Hispanic children at home.

"Improving Functional Status in African Americans with Cancer Pain    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Pain is the most common and distressing symptom experienced by cancer patients and often lowers functional status. Our prior research showed that these disparities arise in part from a lower perception of control over pain. A great deal of clinical experience and research has shown that interventions need to be highly individualized and responsive to the rapidly-changing needs of patients with pain. Because of this, and with shorter hospital stays, patients and their caregivers are more than ever responsible for daily pain and symptom management. Unfortunately, they are not typically prepared for this responsibility. Including both patients and caregivers in interventions is essential since caregivers' beliefs directly affect pain management success. Our ultimate goal is to improve the function of diverse patients with chronic pain. To help cancer patients and caregivers effectively manage pain, we developed and tested a 1-session intervention that included medication management and pain advocacy content. That study showed the central role of perception of control over pain in self management. We are now expanding the intervention to include a third component called Living with Pain. The Living with Pain component is new in the cancer pain population where it can be helpful in maximizing function in spite of pain. We are also increasing the number and type of visits (dose) and providing continuous access for problem solving. Among cancer patients, African Americans report the highest levels of pain and symptom distress, and lower levels of function. Our prior research showed that these disparities arise in part from lower perceptions of control over pain. The new intervention, Power Over Pain - Coaching (POP-C), is tailored to the culture of African American cancer patients and their caregivers and individualized to the unique needs of each patient and caregiver. The purpose of the study is to determine the efficacy of the POP-C intervention to improve function among African American outpatients with cancer pain. This study will contribute significantly to the advancement of pain research by addressing a challenge of treatment that has remained unsolved for a traditionally under-represented minority. When shown to be effective, this intervention can then be adapted for other diverse populations with cancer-related pain or chronic non-cancer pain.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Social justice is the core value of the American public health system. African American cancer patients bear a disproportionate burden from pain and the resultant limitations in function. Excess morbidity from inadequately managed cancer pain in the African American community results in high levels of human suffering, increased family caregiver burdens, and both hidden and explicit economic costs. Effective nursing interventions such as the Power over Pain - Coaching program being tested in this study hold great promise for pain relief among individual cancer patients and their families while we work towards an end to the current systemic disparities in access, treatment, and outcomes.

"Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and functional limitation in the United States. There are significant individual and ethnic group differences in the experience of OA. An improved understanding of factors contributing to the disparities and a biomarker reflecting the variability is needed. The research goals and career development training objectives identified in this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award application have been developed to obtain the training and experience to pursue investigations of the biological interface of chronic pain and psychosocial stress in knee OA. Entitled Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study, the proposed study expands on current research supported in part through the Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) specific to Dr. Sibille's research interests and career ambitions. Additionally, the proposed research aligns with the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) Long Range Plan for Fiscal Years 2010-2014 and the 2010 NIAMS Roundtable Summary.  My career goals are to: 1) excel in an academic medical setting as a clinical/translational pain investigator with expertise in osteoarthritis involved in patient-oriented research and 2) contribute to the research and medical community through scholarship and education with an overall goal of improving the management, functioning, and quality of life for individuals with osteoarthritis and other pain-related conditions. My career development training objectives incorporate activities and experiences pertinent to my research goals and necessary to obtain R01 funding by 2016.  Objective 1: Develop a comprehensive knowledge-base in osteoarthritis  Objective 2: Broaden skills in multi-modal assessment of pain and functional limitations  Objective 3: Increase understanding of genetics and stress-related biological systems  Objective 4: Enhance management skills necessary to function as an independent researcher  Objective 5: Strengthen skills in clinical/translational research, statistics, and scholarship  My career development research and training efforts will be guided by an exceptional mentoring team, Roger Fillingim, Ph.D., Primary Mentor, will provide guidance and oversight in the multi-modal assessment of pain and functional limitations; the integration of biological and psychosocial factors; and my overall career development. Roland Staud, M.D., will oversee the development of a comprehensive knowledge-base in osteoarthritis. Christiaan Leeuwenburgh, Ph.D., Co-Mentor, will provide direction in areas related to metabolic processes, evaluating biological markers, and developing the skills necessary for translational investigation. Taimour Langaee, Ph.D., Co-Mentor, will assist with training and development in the areas of immunology, genetics, and telomere measures. Bruce McEwen, Ph.D., Consultant/Co-Mentor, will direct my training specific to neuroendocrine functioning, the effects of stress on health, and the application of the allostatic load model in the study of knee osteoarthritis. My transition to research independence will also be benefited by relationships developed in the OA Network, an advisory and collaborative group of clinician/researchers.  A comprehensive training plan has been developed that includes didactic coursework, clinical and laboratory experience, directed study; individual and group mentoring meetings; involvement in lab meetings, research interest groups, journal clubs; attendance and presentations at professional conferences; manuscript and grant development; research responsibilities; and academic/department contributions. Completion of the proposed training plan will include obtaining a Certificate of Clinical Translational Research by 2014 through the University of Florida Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The training environment at the University of Florida is outstanding. In addition to the educational programs and resources available through the CTSI, I have the opportunity to train and work with accomplished basic and clinical researchers through the Comprehensive Center for Pain Research, the College of Dentistry, the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence, and the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center.  The proposed research study is novel, multidisciplinary, and translational. The objectives of the study are to prospectively evaluate associations of pain and functional limitations with a developing measure of system burden in ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA and explore the role of various biopsychosocial factors that may be protective or increase vulnerability for pain and functional decline.  There are numerous opportunities with significant clinical implications to extend the translational research efforts proposed. Long-term goals are to elucidate biological markers of system burden in knee OA, delineate resilience and vulnerability factors for prevention and treatment, and establish a composite of biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions. Importantly, the information generated by this research will make a significant scientific contribution as this represents the first study to prospectively examine biological markers of system burden, knee OA status, pain severity, and functional limitations among ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoarthritis is a prevalent condition and a leading cause of disability. We will evaluate changes in pain, functioning, and biological measures reflecting system burden over a four year period in a large group of ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee osteoarthritis. This information will provide an improved understanding of individual differences in osteoarthritis symptoms, help identify targets for prevention and treatment, and provide a measure for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions.            ",Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study,8510154,K23AR062099,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', '

"HIV-associated Neuropathy: Ethnic Disparities and Pathogenesis Minorities and women now account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections. Neuropathy is the  most common neurologic complication of HIV, occurring in up to 60% of patients with advanced disease.  Neuropathy is commonly painful and can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Recent clinical  trials of treatment for neuropathic pain related to HIV have had disappointing results, raising the question of  whether the study medications truly lack efficacy, or if the instruments used to measure pain were poorly  suited to the population under study. Pilot data suggest there may be racial and ethnic differences in clinical  manifestations of HIV-associated neuropathy, including pain. The goal of this project is to better define  these differences and to explore their neuro-biologic and socio-cultural underpinnings. Specific aims are:    1. To determine whether there are differences between racial and ethnic groups in clinical and  neurophysiologic features of HIV-associated neuropathy  2. To determine if commonly used pain scales adequately reflect the pain experience of minority,  low-literacy patients with HIV-associated distal sensory polyneuropathy (HIV-DSP)  3. To determine whether autonomic neuropathy (AN) is prevalent in HIV-positive minorities  4. To determine whether the characteristic peripheral nerve and skin biopsy pathology of HIV-DSP in the  HAART-era varies with race or ethnicity    Retrospective analyses will be performed on data collected by the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium  and the CNS HIV Antiretroviral Effects Research Study. Going forward, predominantly minority patients will  be recruited for detailed neurologic assessment including: administration of pain and symptom scales;  detailed neurologic assessment and quantification of deficits using validated instruments; neurophysiologic  testing (nerve conduction studies, quantitative sensory testing and autonomic testing); and skin biopsy.  Peripheral nerve pathology will be studied using autopsy specimens from the Manhattan HIV Brain Bank. Neuropathy is a common complication of HIV which significantly reduces quality of life, and for which there  is no FDA-approved treatment. HIV now disproportionately affects minorities, so if effective treatments for  neuropathy are to be developed, more information is needed about its clinical and pathologic manifestations  in these populations, including the reporting of pain.",HIV-associated Neuropathy: Ethnic Disparities and Pathogenesis,8512818,K23NS066789,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Autopsy ', ' Biopsy ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complication ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus Type III ', ' Human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' HTLV-III ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HIV Infections ', ' seropositive (AIDS test) ', ' antigen positive AIDS test ', ' antibody positive AIDS test ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Antibody Positivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' AIDS Seropositivity ', ' AIDS Seroconversion ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' literacy ', ' Nerve Conduction ', ' Neural Conduction ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pathology ', ' Patients ', ' Peripheral Nerves ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Diagnostic Findings ', ' Signs and Symptoms ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' Polyneuropathy ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' autonomic neuropathy ', ' neuroAIDS ', ' AIDS neuropathy ', ' instrument ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' Knowledge ', ' neuropathic ', ' Neuropathy ', ' Sensory ', ' experience ', ' immunopathology ', ' antiretroviral ', ' anti-retroviral ', ' Antiretroviral Agents ', ' Anti-Retroviral Agents ', ' Biopsy Sample ', ' Biopsy Specimen ', ' advanced disease ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Reporting ', ' highly active anti-retroviral therapy ', ' HAART ', ' Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy ', ' Skin ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' trial treatment ', ' trial regimen ', ' Clinical Treatment ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' neuropathic pain ', ' painful neuropathy ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' FDA approved ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' ']",NINDS,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,K23,2013,175644,0.3691724212408785
"Native American Pain Disparities: Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences 7.0. Project Summary/Abstract Native Americans (NAs) have a higher prevalence of pain than non-Hispanic whites and other U.S. minority groups. Yet, there is a lack of pain research in NAs, with only 28 papers on pain published in over 30 years. Moreover, no study has assessed pain processing to identify whether pain sensitivity (conscious pain experience), central sensitization (augmented pain signaling in the CNS), and/or CNS pain inhibition (descending pain modulation) contribute to this disparity. Our pilot data indicate that relative to non-Hispanic whites, NAs have lower pain sensitivity (e.g., higher pain tolerance) and show reduced central sensitization (reduced CNS response to pain) on a physiological measure (i.e., temporal summation of the nociceptive flexion reflex). This suggests their CNS responds differently to noxious input, which could have significant clinical implications. Specifically, being less pain sensitive may place NAs at risk for chronic pain because they could have difficulty detecting and preventing tissue damage and/or protecting tissue damage once it has occurred. However, results from these pilot data need to be replicated in a larger sample. Aim 1 will be to determine whether healthy, pain-free Native Americans (n=120) have lowered pain sensitivity, reduced central sensitization, and enhanced pain inhibitory processes relative to a non-Hispanic white control group (n=120). Testing will occur across two sessions using well-validated, state-of-the-art, quantitative sensory testing methods to assess pain processing from subjective (e.g., pain report) and physiological (nociceptive flexion reflex) pain outcomes. Pain sensitivity will be comprehensively assessed from pain threshold, tolerance, and report in response to multiple stimulus modalities (heat, cold, mechanical pressure, ischemia, electrocutaneous). Central sensitization will be assessed from: 1) temporal summation of heat pain (a subjective measure of sensitization), 2) nociceptive flexion reflex threshold (NFR, a physiological measure of spinal nociception), and 3) temporal summation of NFR (a physiological measure of spinal cord hyperexcitability). CNS inhibition of pain and NFR will be assessed from: 1) conditioned pain modulation (i.e., pain inhibits pain) and 2) emotional controls of nociception (i.e., pleasant emotions inhibit pain, unpleasant emotions enhance pain). Aim 2 is to identify individual differences that contribute to altered pain processing in NAs. Thus, pain coping (e.g., pain catastrophizing), sociocultural variables (e.g., ethnic identity), and heredity (i.e., blood quantu level) will be examined to determine whether they are associated with group differences in pain. This research is expected to impact minority health disparities in at least 5 ways: 1) identify mechanisms contributing to pain disparities in NAs, 2) determine if pain disparities in NAs result from physiological processes (e.g., CNS pain inhibition), 3) provide evidence that pain risk is physiologically different in NAs thus identifying the need for tailored interventions, 4) inform methods to assess NAs at-risk for chronic pain, and 5) promote interventions to eliminate pain disparity in NAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Native Americans have a high prevalence of chronic pain. To identify mechanisms contributing to this disparity, the current study will compare healthy, pain-free, Native Americans and non-Hispanic whites on well- validated measures of pain sensitivity (conscious pain experience), central sensitization (augmented CNS pain signaling), and CNS pain inhibition (mechanisms that regulate pain). Analyses will also examine whether group differences in pain are associated with coping style, socioculture, and/or heredity. Information obtained will inform: treatment interventions to reduce pain disparity and methods to screen at-risk individuals.            ",Native American Pain Disparities: Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences,8693014,R01MD007807,"['abstracting ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Control Groups ', ' Emotions ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' Heredity ', ' Ischemia ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Paper ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' pressure ', ' Publishing ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Reflex ', ' Reflex action ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' Injury ', ' exhaust ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' Stimulus ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Native Americans ', ' Reaction ', ' Sensory ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Spinal ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' experience ', ' mechanical pressure ', ' Participant ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Pain-Free ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Economic Burden ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Pain Research ', ' Process ', ' minority health ', ' productivity loss ', ' Minority ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' central sensitization ', ' inhibit pain ', ' pain inhibition ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,R01,2014,303486,0.5203472507924157
"Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and functional limitation in the United States. There are significant individual and ethnic group differences in the experience of OA. An improved understanding of factors contributing to the disparities and a biomarker reflecting the variability is needed. The research goals and career development training objectives identified in this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award application have been developed to obtain the training and experience to pursue investigations of the biological interface of chronic pain and psychosocial stress in knee OA. Entitled Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study, the proposed study expands on current research supported in part through the Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) specific to Dr. Sibille's research interests and career ambitions. Additionally, the proposed research aligns with the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) Long Range Plan for Fiscal Years 2010-2014 and the 2010 NIAMS Roundtable Summary.  My career goals are to: 1) excel in an academic medical setting as a clinical/translational pain investigator with expertise in osteoarthritis involved in patient-oriented research and 2) contribute to the research and medical community through scholarship and education with an overall goal of improving the management, functioning, and quality of life for individuals with osteoarthritis and other pain-related conditions. My career development training objectives incorporate activities and experiences pertinent to my research goals and necessary to obtain R01 funding by 2016.  Objective 1: Develop a comprehensive knowledge-base in osteoarthritis  Objective 2: Broaden skills in multi-modal assessment of pain and functional limitations  Objective 3: Increase understanding of genetics and stress-related biological systems  Objective 4: Enhance management skills necessary to function as an independent researcher  Objective 5: Strengthen skills in clinical/translational research, statistics, and scholarship  My career development research and training efforts will be guided by an exceptional mentoring team, Roger Fillingim, Ph.D., Primary Mentor, will provide guidance and oversight in the multi-modal assessment of pain and functional limitations; the integration of biological and psychosocial factors; and my overall career development. Roland Staud, M.D., will oversee the development of a comprehensive knowledge-base in osteoarthritis. Christiaan Leeuwenburgh, Ph.D., Co-Mentor, will provide direction in areas related to metabolic processes, evaluating biological markers, and developing the skills necessary for translational investigation. Taimour Langaee, Ph.D., Co-Mentor, will assist with training and development in the areas of immunology, genetics, and telomere measures. Bruce McEwen, Ph.D., Consultant/Co-Mentor, will direct my training specific to neuroendocrine functioning, the effects of stress on health, and the application of the allostatic load model in the study of knee osteoarthritis. My transition to research independence will also be benefited by relationships developed in the OA Network, an advisory and collaborative group of clinician/researchers.  A comprehensive training plan has been developed that includes didactic coursework, clinical and laboratory experience, directed study; individual and group mentoring meetings; involvement in lab meetings, research interest groups, journal clubs; attendance and presentations at professional conferences; manuscript and grant development; research responsibilities; and academic/department contributions. Completion of the proposed training plan will include obtaining a Certificate of Clinical Translational Research by 2014 through the University of Florida Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The training environment at the University of Florida is outstanding. In addition to the educational programs and resources available through the CTSI, I have the opportunity to train and work with accomplished basic and clinical researchers through the Comprehensive Center for Pain Research, the College of Dentistry, the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence, and the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center.  The proposed research study is novel, multidisciplinary, and translational. The objectives of the study are to prospectively evaluate associations of pain and functional limitations with a developing measure of system burden in ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA and explore the role of various biopsychosocial factors that may be protective or increase vulnerability for pain and functional decline.  There are numerous opportunities with significant clinical implications to extend the translational research efforts proposed. Long-term goals are to elucidate biological markers of system burden in knee OA, delineate resilience and vulnerability factors for prevention and treatment, and establish a composite of biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions. Importantly, the information generated by this research will make a significant scientific contribution as this represents the first study to prospectively examine biological markers of system burden, knee OA status, pain severity, and functional limitations among ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoarthritis is a prevalent condition and a leading cause of disability. We will evaluate changes in pain, functioning, and biological measures reflecting system burden over a four year period in a large group of ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee osteoarthritis. This information will provide an improved understanding of individual differences in osteoarthritis symptoms, help identify targets for prevention and treatment, and provide a measure for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions.            ",Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study,8641321,K23AR062099,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', '

"Yoga vs. Physical Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain in Minority Populations    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects 5-10% of U.S. adults annually and disproportionately impacts individuals from minority and low income backgrounds due to disparities in access and treatment. Pilot data collected at one of the proposed study sites demonstrate yoga is a feasible and possibly effective intervention for CLBP in minority populations. Evidence from multiple studies supports a moderate benefit in CLBP for exercise therapy individually-delivered by a physical therapist. Moreover, physical therapy is the most common, reimbursed, non-pharmacologic treatment recommended by physicians for CLBP. Our primary study objective is to compare the effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for the treatment of CLBP in a predominantly low income minority population. A 12 week comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial for CLBP is proposed with three treatment arms: (1) A standardized weekly hatha yoga protocol delivered in a class format; (2) a standardized evidence-based exercise therapy protocol individually delivered by a physical therapist; and (3) education delivered through a self-care book. A racially diverse population of 260 adults with CLBP will be recruited from Boston Medical Center and six affiliated community health centers and randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to yoga, physical therapy, and education, respectively. The application's primary aim is to determine the comparative effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for three outcomes at 12 weeks: pain intensity, back-specific function, and use of pain medication. For each of these outcomes, patients randomized to the yoga group are hypothesized to demonstrate clinically and statistically greater improvements than patients in the physical therapy or education groups. After the 12 week intervention period, half of the yoga and physical therapy participants will be randomly selected to participate in a 40 week ongoing structured yoga or physical therapy maintenance program. Pain, function, and pain medication use will be compared between maintenance and non-maintenance groups. Cost and utilization data will also be collected so cost effectiveness analyses from the perspective of society, the third party payer, and the patient can be performed. Together, results from these studies will help determine whether it is justifiable for yoga, currently a ""complementary"" therapy, to become an acceptable ""mainstream"" treatment for chronic low back pain. 1   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic low back pain is a substantial cause of suffering, disability, and cost in U.S. society. Individuals from low income minority backgrounds may be more affected by chronic low back pain due to disparities in health care access and treatment. Our study will compare the effectiveness of yoga to physical therapy for the treatment of chronic low back pain in 260 racially diverse adults recruited from urban community health centers. 1              Project Narrative Chronic low back pain is a substantial cause of suffering, disability, and cost in U.S. society.

"Virtual Perspective-Taking to Reduce Race and SES Disparities in Pain Care     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed project is to test a novel perspective-taking intervention aimed at reducing racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Previous studies found that Black and low SES patients are less likely to receive guideline-concordant pain care relative to White and high SES patients, respectively. Studies also found that clinicians contribute to these treatment disparities, which directly impact patient outcomes. Few interventions effectively reduce racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Interventions that target clinicians are especially scarce. According to research and theory, enhancing clinician perspective-taking is a promising strategy for improving the care of Black and low SES patients, and this strategy should be pursued during medical training to maximize its effectiveness. Unfortunately, there are numerous limitations and practical constraints to traditional perspective-taking interventions, which reduce their implementation and effectiveness. To overcome these barriers, we developed an innovative methodology that utilizes computer-simulated patients and environments to assess, understand, and remediate pain treatment disparities. In the proposed project, we aim to leverage this approach to test a theoretically-informed, evidence-based intervention to reduce racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Using computer-simulated patients and environments, our intervention provides real-time feedback to trainees about their pain treatment biases, includes one-on-one interactions with virtual patients with pain, and includes videos of these patients engaging in daily life activities with pain. Our approach allows for the intervention to be individually-tailored to each trainee, thereby enhancing its impact. It also allows for individual trainees to gain exposure to a greater range of racially and socioeconomically diverse patients than can normally be obtained in traditional training settings. Based on previous research and sound theory, we hypothesize that our perspective-taking intervention will increase trainees' knowledge of their own biases, enhance trainees' empathy toward patients, and reduce trainees' anxiety/threat toward patients, and that these changes will be the primary mechanisms underlying reductions in pain treatment disparities. This project represents a critical next step in the nation's goal of reducing racial ad SES disparities and improving pain care. Our intervention could be readily incorporated into medical school and continuing education curricula for widespread dissemination. Our approach could also be leveraged to reduce disparities for other conditions of public health significance, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Given that clinicians are key participants in patient care and are a primary source of health disparities, the proposed project has direct implications for improving care for vulnerable patients. This project will also inform scientific understanding of the mechanisms (e.g., bias awareness, patient empathy, patient anxiety/threat) underlying treatment disparities, as well as medical education to enhance the delivery of equitable, patient-centered care.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses an important societal issue and represents a critical next step in the nation's goal of reducing health disparities and improving pain care.

"Adherence in African Americans Being Treated for Cancer Pain       DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience a disproportionate burden of cancer pain, suffer worse treatment outcomes, and have overall poor adherence to pain medication. Unfortunately, past research on pain has not fully explored factors important to cancer pain relief and treatment adherence in an economically diverse group of African Americans. Knowledge of the reasons why individuals do not adhere to pain treatment is essential if we are to better understand why they receive inadequate pain relief when adequate treatments are available. The proposed application moves beyond previous understanding of adherence by exploring the context of individuals - the social network and neighborhood that surround them and influence their behavior. This examination of social contextual factors requires a mixed method multilevel approach to explore the ""what"" and ""how"" of opiate adherence. Framed in a social ecological model, the aims of this study are to examine the influence of individual (symptom profile including pain and depression, pain beliefs, education, and gender) interpersonal (religious and social support), and neighborhood factors (socioeconomic measures, segregation, and drug related crime) on ""around the clock"" opiate adherence in African Americans being treated for cancer pain. A parallel mixed method design approach will be used that includes a quantitative and qualitative strand. The quantitative strand will provide information on what factors influence opiate adherence and the qualitative strand will provide a rich description of how these factors affect adherence. Along with the execution of this research, a comprehensive training and career mentoring plan will be carried out at Emory University under the mentorship of experts in symptom outcomes, pain disparities, medication adherence, and community factors of sociodemographic outcomes of health. The candidate's training goals include: 1) develop expertise in mixed- method research focusing on a minority sample being treated for cancer pain; 2) acquire methodological skills in geospatial analysis and statistics in order to better understand sources of disparities in non-adherence to opiates; and 3) build skills to position for next steps in the research trajectory. The goal of this project is to enhance understanding of pain medication adherence in African Americans. The long-range goal is to identify effective mechanisms to improve cancer pain relief, especially for those suffering the highest burden of cancer, African Americans. This training grant will prepare the candidate to be a successful independent researcher with preliminary information to improve pain management through treatment/assessment recommendations and/or patient and community interventions to ultimately improve pain management in African Americans with cancer pain.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience a disproportionate burden of cancer pain, suffer worse treatment outcomes, and have overall poor adherence to pain medication. The proposed study will examine individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood factors of opiate adherence for an economically diverse sample of AAs with cancer pain. Knowledge of the reasons why individuals do not adhere to pain treatment is essential if we are to better understand why they receive inadequate pain relief when adequate treatments are available. The overall project goal is to enhance understanding of pain medication adherence.

"Yoga vs. Physical Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain in Minority Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects 5-10% of U.S. adults annually and disproportionately impacts individuals from minority and low income backgrounds due to disparities in access and treatment. Pilot data collected at one of the proposed study sites demonstrate yoga is a feasible and possibly effective intervention for CLBP in minority populations. Evidence from multiple studies supports a moderate benefit in CLBP for exercise therapy individually-delivered by a physical therapist. Moreover, physical therapy is the most common, reimbursed, non-pharmacologic treatment recommended by physicians for CLBP. Our primary study objective is to compare the effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for the treatment of CLBP in a predominantly low income minority population. A 12 week comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial for CLBP is proposed with three treatment arms: (1) A standardized weekly hatha yoga protocol delivered in a class format; (2) a standardized evidence-based exercise therapy protocol individually delivered by a physical therapist; and (3) education delivered through a self-care book. A racially diverse population of 260 adults with CLBP will be recruited from Boston Medical Center and six affiliated community health centers and randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to yoga, physical therapy, and education, respectively. The application's primary aim is to determine the comparative effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for three outcomes at 12 weeks: pain intensity, back-specific function, and use of pain medication. For each of these outcomes, patients randomized to the yoga group are hypothesized to demonstrate clinically and statistically greater improvements than patients in the physical therapy or education groups. After the 12 week intervention period, half of the yoga and physical therapy participants will be randomly selected to participate in a 40 week ongoing structured yoga or physical therapy maintenance program. Pain, function, and pain medication use will be compared between maintenance and non-maintenance groups. Cost and utilization data will also be collected so cost effectiveness analyses from the perspective of society, the third party payer, and the patient can be performed. Together, results from these studies will help determine whether it is justifiable for yoga, currently a ""complementary"" therapy, to become an acceptable ""mainstream"" treatment for chronic low back pain. 1    Project Narrative Chronic low back pain is a substantial cause of suffering, disability, and cost in U.S. society. Individuals from low income minority backgrounds may be more affected by chronic low back pain due to disparities in health care access and treatment. Our study will compare the effectiveness of yoga to physical therapy for the treatment of chronic low back pain in 260 racially diverse adults recruited from urban community health centers. 1",Yoga vs. Physical Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain in Minority Populations,8990064,R01AT005956,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Books ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Expenditure ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Low Income Population ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Maintenance ', ' Moods ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Education ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Safety ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Yoga ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Third-Party Payer ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Exercise Therapy ', ' Physical therapy exercises ', ' Inferior ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Complementary therapies ', ' Physiotherapy Procedure ', ' Physiotherapy (Techniques) ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical Therapy Techniques ', ' Physical Therapy Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' Population ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' function improvement ', ' functional improvement ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' economic implication ', ' arm ', ' Pain intensity ', ' ']",NCCIH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,184623,0.31186525093536616
"Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PTSD and chronic pain are highly prevalent and each is associated with long-term disability and substance abuse, exacting enormous emotional, functional, and financial tolls on individuals and society. PTSD and chronic pain are frequently co-morbid with overlap between 20% and 70%, representing an enormous public health problem. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which PTSD and chronic pain become intertwined is limited. The majority of studies of the PTSD/chronic pain co-morbidity are cross- sectional, and focused on a single chronic pain condition, limiting causal inferences and generalizability to other chronic pain conditions. Chronic pain is also related to a high prevalence of substance abuse. To understand how trauma-related PTSD, and resilience and vulnerability factors contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse requires prospective designs. Such research is vital among inner-city African American women, who are more likely to experience traumatic stress and pain, but are less likely to be treated appropriately; a phenomenon perhaps leading to greater risk for disability and substance abuse. We propose to examine 3 models related to the development of PTSD/chronic pain pairing and development of substance abuse in people initially presenting with acute pain (not caused by a traumatic event) in a 6-month prospective design. First is the Main Effects Model in which the level of PTSD symptoms at baseline will predict the likelihood of a transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse at 6 months. Second is the Moderation Model in which baseline vulnerability and resilience factors interact with PTSD symptoms to predict the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later. Third is the Mediator Model in which relationships between baseline levels of PTSD symptoms and the development of chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later are mediated by vulnerability and resilience factors at 3 months. Inner-city women (N=600) presenting to an Emergency Department with a complaint of acute bodily pain, ages 18-40 yrs, will be recruited. Only women presenting with acute pelvic/abdominal, neck/shoulder or low back pain, and who do not have a chronic pain history will be enrolled. We will assess trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, pain sensitivity, substance dependence and abuse, acute pain and psychosocial resilience and vulnerability factors across 3 waves (baseline, 3- and 6-months), and obtain additional phone assessment of pain intensity and interference at 1-, 2-, 4-, and 5-months. Inner-city women were chosen because of their high likelihood of exposure to ongoing traumatic events and the opportunity to illuminate a health disparity involving the PTSD/chronic pain pairing among inner-city minority women in particular. The public health problem posed by co-morbid PTSD, chronic pain and substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic pain and developing substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PTSD and chronic pain frequently co-occur with 20-70% of people with chronic pain conditions reporting trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. The public health problem posed by co-occurring PTSD, chronic pain and concomitant substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Results from this prospective study of how PTSD influences the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse will shed light on this well-documented but poorly understood co-morbidity. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions.            ",Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women,8959791,R01DA039522,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Age ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Neck ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvis ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Shoulder ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' tool ', ' psychosocial ', ' inner city ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain interference ', ' Pain intensity ', ' ']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,618230,0.334506989553484
"Native American Pain Disparities: Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences 7.0. Project Summary/Abstract Native Americans (NAs) have a higher prevalence of pain than non-Hispanic whites and other U.S. minority groups. Yet, there is a lack of pain research in NAs, with only 28 papers on pain published in over 30 years. Moreover, no study has assessed pain processing to identify whether pain sensitivity (conscious pain experience), central sensitization (augmented pain signaling in the CNS), and/or CNS pain inhibition (descending pain modulation) contribute to this disparity. Our pilot data indicate that relative to non-Hispanic whites, NAs have lower pain sensitivity (e.g., higher pain tolerance) and show reduced central sensitization (reduced CNS response to pain) on a physiological measure (i.e., temporal summation of the nociceptive flexion reflex). This suggests their CNS responds differently to noxious input, which could have significant clinical implications. Specifically, being less pain sensitive may place NAs at risk for chronic pain because they could have difficulty detecting and preventing tissue damage and/or protecting tissue damage once it has occurred. However, results from these pilot data need to be replicated in a larger sample. Aim 1 will be to determine whether healthy, pain-free Native Americans (n=120) have lowered pain sensitivity, reduced central sensitization, and enhanced pain inhibitory processes relative to a non-Hispanic white control group (n=120). Testing will occur across two sessions using well-validated, state-of-the-art, quantitative sensory testing methods to assess pain processing from subjective (e.g., pain report) and physiological (nociceptive flexion reflex) pain outcomes. Pain sensitivity will be comprehensively assessed from pain threshold, tolerance, and report in response to multiple stimulus modalities (heat, cold, mechanical pressure, ischemia, electrocutaneous). Central sensitization will be assessed from: 1) temporal summation of heat pain (a subjective measure of sensitization), 2) nociceptive flexion reflex threshold (NFR, a physiological measure of spinal nociception), and 3) temporal summation of NFR (a physiological measure of spinal cord hyperexcitability). CNS inhibition of pain and NFR will be assessed from: 1) conditioned pain modulation (i.e., pain inhibits pain) and 2) emotional controls of nociception (i.e., pleasant emotions inhibit pain, unpleasant emotions enhance pain). Aim 2 is to identify individual differences that contribute to altered pain processing in NAs. Thus, pain coping (e.g., pain catastrophizing), sociocultural variables (e.g., ethnic identity), and heredity (i.e., blood quantu level) will be examined to determine whether they are associated with group differences in pain. This research is expected to impact minority health disparities in at least 5 ways: 1) identify mechanisms contributing to pain disparities in NAs, 2) determine if pain disparities in NAs result from physiological processes (e.g., CNS pain inhibition), 3) provide evidence that pain risk is physiologically different in NAs thus identifying the need for tailored interventions, 4) inform methods to assess NAs at-risk for chronic pain, and 5) promote interventions to eliminate pain disparity in NAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Native Americans have a high prevalence of chronic pain. To identify mechanisms contributing to this disparity, the current study will compare healthy, pain-free, Native Americans and non-Hispanic whites on well- validated measures of pain sensitivity (conscious pain experience), central sensitization (augmented CNS pain signaling), and CNS pain inhibition (mechanisms that regulate pain). Analyses will also examine whether group differences in pain are associated with coping style, socioculture, and/or heredity. Information obtained will inform: treatment interventions to reduce pain disparity and methods to screen at-risk individuals.            ",Native American Pain Disparities: Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences,8805745,R01MD007807,"['abstracting ', ' Awareness ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Control Groups ', ' Emotions ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Heating ', ' Heredity ', ' Ischemia ', ' Methods ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Paper ', ' Physiologic Processes ', ' Organismal Process ', ' Organism-Level Process ', ' Physiological Processes ', ' pressure ', ' Publishing ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Reflex ', ' Reflex action ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Medulla Spinalis ', ' Spinal Cord ', ' Testing ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' Injury ', ' exhaust ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Ensure ', ' disability ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' Stimulus ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Native Americans ', ' Reaction ', ' Sensory ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Spinal ', ' directs attention ', ' directed attention ', ' experience ', ' mechanical pressure ', ' Participant ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Modality ', ' Reporting ', ' Emotional ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Pain-Free ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Economic Burden ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Pain Research ', ' Process ', ' minority health ', ' productivity loss ', ' Minority ', ' quantum ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' central sensitization ', ' inhibit pain ', ' pain inhibition ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TULSA,R01,2015,305091,0.5203472507924157

"Self-Applied Wearable Ultrasound Therapy for Osteoarthritis Management in Underserved Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints which affects 27 million Americans, causing chronic pain, limited mobility and overall reduction in the quality of life. Americans with OA currently manage their symptoms through lifestyle changes (weight loss, exercise, etc.), physiotherapy, and medications to reduce pain and inflammation. Although OA affects individuals from all races and backgrounds, minorities and individuals lacking access to quality healthcare experience more negative outcomes and worse disease progressions, including severe pain and working limitations. Therapeutic ultrasound has shown promise as a non-pharmaceutical treatment for OA, but limitations on the accessibility, cost and length of treatment have prevented therapeutic ultrasound from becoming widespread. The investigative team proposes to develop a portable, wearable, self-applied ultrasound device to deliver multi-hour Sustained Acoustic Medicine for OsteoArthritis (SAMOA). The teams Phase I proposal demonstrated that the SAMOA device could be engineered for daily therapeutic self-application by the participants at home, and that SAMOA significantly reduced the pain of knee OA over the placebo device. This Phase II project further develops SAMOA and moves towards commercialization of the technology for the symptomatic management of OA. First, the SAMOA device will be engineered for improved ergonomic function in the arthritic community, ensuring that all user-interface elements are streamlined for those who may have reduced manual strength or dexterity. Second, the device will be evaluated in a larger clinical trial, providing a statistical demonstration of the treatment's benefit across minority groups which will be essential for regulatory approval and acceptance in the medical community. Third, the SAMOA device will be tested in the field for a real-world evaluation of how physicians prescribe, and patients adopt and interact with the device, providing a critical final test of the system. The SAMOA medical device will have a cost under $100 to purchase and under $20 per month to operate, making it broadly accessible and less costly to operate for 1 year than 3 months of many prescription medications. After the successful completion of Phase II, SAMOA technology will have the potential to be adopted as a pharmaceutical-free alternative to traditional OA care. Furthermore, the ease of use and low cost of this device will make it accessible to minorities and underserved communities, reducing disparities in healthcare across America.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work is relevant to the symptomatic management of osteoarthritis (OA), which impacts over 27 million Americans. This research seeks to improve the care of osteoarthritis for minorities, non-minorities, and patients with healt disparities by developing a novel, non-pharmaceutical, long duration therapeutic ultrasound device for the treatment of chronic OA pain. The technology has been preliminarily tested with positive results, and now will be refined for general use by the arthritic patient and clinically evaluated as a drug-free approach to OA care.

"Social and behavioral influences on clinical communication and pain management DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Compared to white patients with advanced cancer, black patients experience inferior pain control and less frequent and less effective discussions about symptoms, prognosis and treatment preferences. It is not clear the degree to which these differences are due to patient factors (e.g. asking fewer questions) or physician factors (e.g. implicit/unconscious racial bias, poor communication). Preliminary studies suggest that activating patients to be more assertive and to ask more questions during the visit can mitigate racial differences in communication and pain management. The proposed study addresses this critical question though a field experiment. Using novel standardized patient methodology, we will randomly assign black or white patients with identical cancer history and symptoms to primary care and oncology physicians to examine whether potentially mutable patient and physician behaviors (activation and patient-centered communication) might mitigate some of these racial differences, including those that are due to implicit biases. Aims: 1. To examine the magnitude of racial differences in physicians' assessment of pain, discussions about  prognosis and treatment choices, and use of guideline-concordant pain management. 2. To examine whether patient activation mitigates racial differences in physician communication behaviors  and pain management decisions. 3. To explore potential moderators of racial differences in physician communication behaviors and pain  management decisions, such as patient-centered communication and implicit unconscious bias. Methods: We will conduct a randomized experiment examining mutable patient and physician behaviors. We will create 4 unannounced standardized patient (SP, ""secret shopper"") roles portraying identical scenarios - a 70-year old patient with advanced cancer and uncontrolled pain - differing only by patient race (black/white) and level of activation (high/typical). We will randomly assign 120 physicians to see 2 unannounced covert SPs of the same race over a 12-month period, but differing according to activation. Outcome measures: We will transcribe and code audio-recorded physician-SP visits. We will code the depth of physician pain assessment using the Measure of Physician Pain Assessment, developed in our pilot (Cronbach's 1 = .68). We will assess prognosis and treatment choice communication using the Prognosis and Treatment Choices measure, which we developed in our pilot (Cronbach's 1 = 0.80). We found racial differences on both of these outcomes in our pilot. We will assess guideline-concordant pain medication recommendations using chart audit and review of transcripts. We will assess Exploring and Validating Concerns a component of patient-centered communication that has been associated with prescribing behavior, and the Implicit Associations Test, a measure of implicit bias to examine their moderating effects (Aim 3). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Our project will identify the degree to which racial disparities exist in physicians' communication with patients with advanced cancer with regard to pain control, prognosis and treatment choices. We will also study whether patients who are ""activated"" -- those who ask more questions and are more involved in their care -- experience fewer racial disparities. Results from this research will inform interventions for physicians and patients to promote better communication and thereby reduce or eliminate racial disparities in care.",Social and behavioral influences on clinical communication and pain management,8816046,R01CA155376,"['Affect ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Behavior ', ' Black race ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Learning ', ' Methods ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Measures ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Specialist ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' communication behavior ', ' Label ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Attenuated ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Inferior ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Visit ', ' preference ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' ethnic discrimination ', ' behavioral influence ', ' behavior influence ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Consent ', ' Detection ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Transcript ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Outcome ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' ']",NCI,PURDUE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,489050,0.283439848809723
"Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and functional limitation in the United States. There are significant individual and ethnic group differences in the experience of OA. An improved understanding of factors contributing to the disparities and a biomarker reflecting the variability is needed. The research goals and career development training objectives identified in this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award application have been developed to obtain the training and experience to pursue investigations of the biological interface of chronic pain and psychosocial stress in knee OA. Entitled Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study, the proposed study expands on current research supported in part through the Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) specific to Dr. Sibille's research interests and career ambitions. Additionally, the proposed research aligns with the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) Long Range Plan for Fiscal Years 2010-2014 and the 2010 NIAMS Roundtable Summary.  My career goals are to: 1) excel in an academic medical setting as a clinical/translational pain investigator with expertise in osteoarthritis involved in patient-oriented research and 2) contribute to the research and medical community through scholarship and education with an overall goal of improving the management, functioning, and quality of life for individuals with osteoarthritis and other pain-related conditions. My career development training objectives incorporate activities and experiences pertinent to my research goals and necessary to obtain R01 funding by 2016.  Objective 1: Develop a comprehensive knowledge-base in osteoarthritis  Objective 2: Broaden skills in multi-modal assessment of pain and functional limitations  Objective 3: Increase understanding of genetics and stress-related biological systems  Objective 4: Enhance management skills necessary to function as an independent researcher  Objective 5: Strengthen skills in clinical/translational research, statistics, and scholarship  My career development research and training efforts will be guided by an exceptional mentoring team, Roger Fillingim, Ph.D., Primary Mentor, will provide guidance and oversight in the multi-modal assessment of pain and functional limitations; the integration of biological and psychosocial factors; and my overall career development. Roland Staud, M.D., will oversee the development of a comprehensive knowledge-base in osteoarthritis. Christiaan Leeuwenburgh, Ph.D., Co-Mentor, will provide direction in areas related to metabolic processes, evaluating biological markers, and developing the skills necessary for translational investigation. Taimour Langaee, Ph.D., Co-Mentor, will assist with training and development in the areas of immunology, genetics, and telomere measures. Bruce McEwen, Ph.D., Consultant/Co-Mentor, will direct my training specific to neuroendocrine functioning, the effects of stress on health, and the application of the allostatic load model in the study of knee osteoarthritis. My transition to research independence will also be benefited by relationships developed in the OA Network, an advisory and collaborative group of clinician/researchers.  A comprehensive training plan has been developed that includes didactic coursework, clinical and laboratory experience, directed study; individual and group mentoring meetings; involvement in lab meetings, research interest groups, journal clubs; attendance and presentations at professional conferences; manuscript and grant development; research responsibilities; and academic/department contributions. Completion of the proposed training plan will include obtaining a Certificate of Clinical Translational Research by 2014 through the University of Florida Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The training environment at the University of Florida is outstanding. In addition to the educational programs and resources available through the CTSI, I have the opportunity to train and work with accomplished basic and clinical researchers through the Comprehensive Center for Pain Research, the College of Dentistry, the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence, and the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center.  The proposed research study is novel, multidisciplinary, and translational. The objectives of the study are to prospectively evaluate associations of pain and functional limitations with a developing measure of system burden in ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA and explore the role of various biopsychosocial factors that may be protective or increase vulnerability for pain and functional decline.  There are numerous opportunities with significant clinical implications to extend the translational research efforts proposed. Long-term goals are to elucidate biological markers of system burden in knee OA, delineate resilience and vulnerability factors for prevention and treatment, and establish a composite of biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions. Importantly, the information generated by this research will make a significant scientific contribution as this represents the first study to prospectively examine biological markers of system burden, knee OA status, pain severity, and functional limitations among ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoarthritis is a prevalent condition and a leading cause of disability. We will evaluate changes in pain, functioning, and biological measures reflecting system burden over a four year period in a large group of ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee osteoarthritis. This information will provide an improved understanding of individual differences in osteoarthritis symptoms, help identify targets for prevention and treatment, and provide a measure for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions.",Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study,8826562,K23AR062099,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', '

"Everyday Quality of Life in Blacks and Whites with Osteoarthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research examines relationships among pain, everyday activities and mood states, and long-term quality of life among African American (AA; Black) and non-Hispanic White (NHW; White) older adults with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Recent evidence suggests considerable divergence in the experience and effects of this potentially very debilitating disorder among AAs and NHWs. Unfortunately, there has been little in-depth research on racial/ethnic (R/E) differences previous work on racial/ethnic (R/E) disparities in basic experience of OA symptoms, and in the emotional impact of those symptoms and related disability. This research addresses that gap in a longitudinal study of OA pain, functional disability and emotional well-being of AAs and NHWs. Working from a biopsychosocial model, we shall use functional assessments, self-reports, and real-time assessments of activities, symptoms and mood states to construct a comprehensive view of how OA affects physical and emotional functioning. Specific aims are (1) to describe racial/ethnic differences in associations among pain, disability, and emotional well-being of persons with OA of the knee; (2) to identify origins of those differences in (a) biological factors such as disease process and general health, (b) social factors such as demographic characteristics, and (ii) psychological factors, including stable personal characteristics and transitory (within-day) affective, cognitive and behavioral responses to knee symptoms; (3) to use experience sampling methods (ESM) and actigraphy to investigate how racial/ethnic differences in global associations among pain, functional limitations and emotional distress are reflected in the daily lives of OA sufferers, and (4) to explore how the interplay of transitory (within-day) symptoms, activities and mood states influences long-term physical and emotional well-being. These aims will be achieved in a 5-year, multi- site project examining cross-sectional and longitudinal associations among demographic and health characteristics, OA-related pain and disability, restriction of everyday activities, and emotional well-being. A sample of 220 AA and 220 NHW adults aged 50+ with physician-diagnosed OA of the knee will complete a comprehensive baseline assessment tapping biological, psychological and social vulnerability to OA pain and its effects; objective functional limitations; pain; activity restriction, and emotiona distress. Immediately post- baseline, participants will complete a 7-day ESM procedure comprising actigraphic assessment of activity levels along with 4 daily telephone contacts to assess current symptoms, activities, and moods. One year later, participants will repeat all measures, including the ESM component, to capture changes in overall physical and emotional well-being as well as patterns of daily activity and moods. Resulting data will offer unprecedented insight into the global factors that differentiate AAs' and NHWs' experience of OA symptoms, and how daily experiences are concatenated to influence longer-term physical and emotional well-being. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic illness and the leading cause of pain and disability among older adults. As the population ages, prevalence of OA is rising sharply; this, in turn, portends rising rates of disability and health care costs. Osteoarthritis's characteristic pain and functional limitations place persons at increased risk of significant emotional distress; that distress may, in turn, fuel OA pain and hasten functional decline. There are clear differences in the epidemiology of OA among African American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) older adults, but surprisingly little is known about racial/ethnic disparities in the functional and emotional effects of OA. This study fills that gap by examining how OA of the knee affects everyday activities and emotional well-being of older AAs and NHWs, and how those effects change over a one-year period.",Everyday Quality of Life in Blacks and Whites with Osteoarthritis,8906719,R01AG041655,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Affective Symptoms ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Attention ', ' Natural Products ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Diagnosis ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' indexing ', ' Knee ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Personality ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' Shapes ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' actigraphy ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2015,550616,0.22669871114796178
"Ethnic differences in endogenous pain regulation: PET imaging of opioid receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is the number one motivator for healthcare utilization, affects over 100 million Americans, costs in excess of one trillion dollars annually and exacts profound suffering and physical disability. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that ethnic groups show substantial variability in the experience of acute and clinical pain, with African Americans (AAs) having increased prevalence of a number of clinical pain conditions and reporting higher levels of pain severity and pain-related disability in response to pain when compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Evidence suggests that disparities between these groups are independent of other demographic factors such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, education, employment, marital status, and other potential confounders, such as medical comorbidities and disease duration. These ethnic differences have been mirrored in the laboratory where controlled, systematic noxious stimuli are applied to healthy individuals. Ethnic differences in laboratory pain responses are well-established, suggesting increased sensitivity to noxious stimulation among AAs compared to NHWs. In our previous work, we have demonstrated enhanced responsiveness in AAs to noxious stimulation on several tasks that indirectly assess endogenous pain-inhibitory systems that are at least partially opioid-mediated. Ethnic differences in endogenous opioid neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system suggest that these systems function less efficiently among AAs and may account for a substantial proportion of the ethnic differences observed in pain and analgesic responses. In addition, pharmacogenetic research shows substantial ethnic group differences in the metabolism, clinical effectiveness, and side-effect profiles of many drugs; including analgesics. The overwhelming majority of clinically used opioids elicit their effects through activation of the mu-opioid receptor, making it an extremely relevant target for investigation. We propose to examine ethnic differences in the supraspinal endogenous opioid system using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mu-opioid receptors employing the mu-selective agonist [11C] carfentanil. Healthy AAs and sex, age, SES matched, NHW participants will undergo one baseline (non-pain) and one capsaicin-induced pain PET session using [11C] carfentanil. The current proposal will measure mu-opioid binding potential and examine its role in ethnic group differences in pain sensitivity. Our overarching objective is to investigate the endogenous opioid system as the mechanism underlying the association between ethnicity and pain sensitivity, thereby enhancing our understanding of the neurobiology of ethnic differences. These findings will have far reaching implications; including elucidating a tangible, physiological mechanism underlying ethnic differences in pain, for prescribing analgesics and advancing personalized medicine. Enhancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying ethnic differences in pain is likely to assist in the refinement of targeted interventios to alleviate clinical pain in at-risk populations, and aid in reducing pain-related health disparites. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain is a major public health problem producing enormous economic costs and profound suffering; considerable evidence demonstrates disparities in the experience of acute and clinical pain, with African Americans experiencing a greater burden of pain when compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The current proposal will measure the endogenous opioid system and examine its role in disparities in pain report. Our goal is to investigate the endogenous opioid system as the mechanism underlying the disparities in pain sensitivity, thereby enhancing our understanding of the neurobiology of ethnic/racial differences in pain, which will assist in the refinement of targeted interventions to alleviate clinical pain i at-risk populations, and aid in reducing pain-related health disparities.",Ethnic differences in endogenous pain regulation: PET imaging of opioid receptors,8890213,R01MD009063,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' 8-Methyl-N-Vanillyl-6-Nonenamide ', ' 6-Nonenamide, N-((4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl)-8-methyl-, (E)- ', ' Capsaicin ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Employment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Laboratories ', ' Marital Status ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Play ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Work ', ' carfentanyl ', ' 4-methoxycarbonylfentanyl ', ' 4-methoxycarbonyl fentanyl ', ' carfentanil ', ' μ receptors ', ' μ opioid receptors ', ' mu Receptors ', ' Receptors, Opioid, mu ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' endogenous opioid ', ' Endogenous Opiates ', ' Peripheral Nervous System ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Opioid ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Agonist ', ' Opiates ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Sensory ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' economic cost ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' disease length ', ' disease duration ', ' illness length ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' Binding (Molecular Function) ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Opioid Receptor Binding ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' inhibit pain ', ' pain inhibition ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalized medicine ', ' ']",NIMHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,405000,0.4633439640882996
"Adherence in African Americans Being Treated for Cancer Pain       DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans experience a disproportionate burden of cancer pain, suffer worse treatment outcomes, and have overall poor adherence to pain medication. Unfortunately, past research on pain has not fully explored factors important to cancer pain relief and treatment adherence in an economically diverse group of African Americans. Knowledge of the reasons why individuals do not adhere to pain treatment is essential if we are to better understand why they receive inadequate pain relief when adequate treatments are available. The proposed application moves beyond previous understanding of adherence by exploring the context of individuals - the social network and neighborhood that surround them and influence their behavior. This examination of social contextual factors requires a mixed method multilevel approach to explore the ""what"" and ""how"" of opiate adherence. Framed in a social ecological model, the aims of this study are to examine the influence of individual (symptom profile including pain and depression, pain beliefs, education, and gender) interpersonal (religious and social support), and neighborhood factors (socioeconomic measures, segregation, and drug related crime) on ""around the clock"" opiate adherence in African Americans being treated for cancer pain. A parallel mixed method design approach will be used that includes a quantitative and qualitative strand. The quantitative strand will provide information on what factors influence opiate adherence and the qualitative strand will provide a rich description of how these factors affect adherence. Along with the execution of this research, a comprehensive training and career mentoring plan will be carried out at Emory University under the mentorship of experts in symptom outcomes, pain disparities, medication adherence, and community factors of sociodemographic outcomes of health. The candidate's training goals include: 1) develop expertise in mixed- method research focusing on a minority sample being treated for cancer pain; 2) acquire methodological skills in geospatial analysis and statistics in order to better understand sources of disparities in non-adherence to opiates; and 3) build skills to position for next steps in the research trajectory. The goal of this project is to enhance understanding of pain medication adherence in African Americans. The long-range goal is to identify effective mechanisms to improve cancer pain relief, especially for those suffering the highest burden of cancer, African Americans. This training grant will prepare the candidate to be a successful independent researcher with preliminary information to improve pain management through treatment/assessment recommendations and/or patient and community interventions to ultimately improve pain management in African Americans with cancer pain.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans experience a disproportionate burden of cancer pain, suffer worse treatment outcomes, and have overall poor adherence to pain medication.

"Virtual Perspective-Taking to Reduce Race and SES Disparities in Pain Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed project is to test a novel perspective-taking intervention aimed at reducing racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Previous studies found that Black and low SES patients are less likely to receive guideline-concordant pain care relative to White and high SES patients, respectively. Studies also found that clinicians contribute to these treatment disparities, which directly impact patient outcomes. Few interventions effectively reduce racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Interventions that target clinicians are especially scarce. According to research and theory, enhancing clinician perspective-taking is a promising strategy for improving the care of Black and low SES patients, and this strategy should be pursued during medical training to maximize its effectiveness. Unfortunately, there are numerous limitations and practical constraints to traditional perspective-taking interventions, which reduce their implementation and effectiveness. To overcome these barriers, we developed an innovative methodology that utilizes computer-simulated patients and environments to assess, understand, and remediate pain treatment disparities. In the proposed project, we aim to leverage this approach to test a theoretically-informed, evidence-based intervention to reduce racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Using computer-simulated patients and environments, our intervention provides real-time feedback to trainees about their pain treatment biases, includes one-on-one interactions with virtual patients with pain, and includes videos of these patients engaging in daily life activities with pain. Our approach allows for the intervention to be individually-tailored to each trainee, thereby enhancing its impact. It also allows for individual trainees to gain exposure to a greater range of racially and socioeconomically diverse patients than can normally be obtained in traditional training settings. Based on previous research and sound theory, we hypothesize that our perspective-taking intervention will increase trainees' knowledge of their own biases, enhance trainees' empathy toward patients, and reduce trainees' anxiety/threat toward patients, and that these changes will be the primary mechanisms underlying reductions in pain treatment disparities. This project represents a critical next step in the nation's goal of reducing racial ad SES disparities and improving pain care. Our intervention could be readily incorporated into medical school and continuing education curricula for widespread dissemination. Our approach could also be leveraged to reduce disparities for other conditions of public health significance, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Given that clinicians are key participants in patient care and are a primary source of health disparities, the proposed project has direct implications for improving care for vulnerable patients. This project will also inform scientific understanding of the mechanisms (e.g., bias awareness, patient empathy, patient anxiety/threat) underlying treatment disparities, as well as medical education to enhance the delivery of equitable, patient-centered care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses an important societal issue and represents a critical next step in the nation's goal of reducing health disparities and improving pain care. The results will have direct implications for patient care, medical education, and scientific understanding of racial and socioeconomic disparities in pain treatment.",Virtual Perspective-Taking to Reduce Race and SES Disparities in Pain Care,8884646,R01MD008931,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Affect ', ' Americas ', ' Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Financial cost ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Medical Education ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Face Pain ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Method LOINC Axis 6 ', ' Methodology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' Work ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' missing work ', ' Employee Absenteeism ', ' Absenteeism at work ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' virtual human ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' unique treatment ', ' targeted treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' ']",NIMHD,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2015,366171,0.36796028325355734
"Yoga vs. Physical Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain in Minority Populations DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic low back pain (CLBP) affects 5-10% of U.S. adults annually and disproportionately impacts individuals from minority and low income backgrounds due to disparities in access and treatment. Pilot data collected at one of the proposed study sites demonstrate yoga is a feasible and possibly effective intervention for CLBP in minority populations. Evidence from multiple studies supports a moderate benefit in CLBP for exercise therapy individually-delivered by a physical therapist. Moreover, physical therapy is the most common, reimbursed, non-pharmacologic treatment recommended by physicians for CLBP. Our primary study objective is to compare the effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for the treatment of CLBP in a predominantly low income minority population. A 12 week comparative effectiveness randomized controlled trial for CLBP is proposed with three treatment arms: (1) A standardized weekly hatha yoga protocol delivered in a class format; (2) a standardized evidence-based exercise therapy protocol individually delivered by a physical therapist; and (3) education delivered through a self-care book. A racially diverse population of 260 adults with CLBP will be recruited from Boston Medical Center and six affiliated community health centers and randomized in a 2:2:1 ratio to yoga, physical therapy, and education, respectively. The application's primary aim is to determine the comparative effectiveness of yoga, physical therapy, and education for three outcomes at 12 weeks: pain intensity, back-specific function, and use of pain medication. For each of these outcomes, patients randomized to the yoga group are hypothesized to demonstrate clinically and statistically greater improvements than patients in the physical therapy or education groups. After the 12 week intervention period, half of the yoga and physical therapy participants will be randomly selected to participate in a 40 week ongoing structured yoga or physical therapy maintenance program. Pain, function, and pain medication use will be compared between maintenance and non-maintenance groups. Cost and utilization data will also be collected so cost effectiveness analyses from the perspective of society, the third party payer, and the patient can be performed. Together, results from these studies will help determine whether it is justifiable for yoga, currently a ""complementary"" therapy, to become an acceptable ""mainstream"" treatment for chronic low back pain. 1    Project Narrative Chronic low back pain is a substantial cause of suffering, disability, and cost in U.S. society. Individuals from low income minority backgrounds may be more affected by chronic low back pain due to disparities in health care access and treatment. Our study will compare the effectiveness of yoga to physical therapy for the treatment of chronic low back pain in 260 racially diverse adults recruited from urban community health centers. 1",Yoga vs. Physical Therapy for Chronic Low Back Pain in Minority Populations,9070074,R01AT005956,"['adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' Dorsum ', ' Back ', ' Books ', ' Boston ', ' Communities ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Expenditure ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Insurers ', ' Insurance Carriers ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Low Income Population ', ' achievement Mainstream Education ', ' Mainstreaming ', ' Educational Mainstreaming ', ' Mainstreaming (Education) ', ' Maintenance ', ' Moods ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Physical Education ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Safety ', ' personal care ', ' Self Care ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Yoga ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Third-Party Payer ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Therapeutic ', ' programs ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Exercise Therapy ', ' Physical therapy exercises ', ' Inferior ', ' Medical center ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' Complementary therapies ', ' Physiotherapy Procedure ', ' Physiotherapy (Techniques) ', ' Physiotherapy ', ' Physical Therapy Techniques ', ' Physical Therapy Procedure ', ' Physical Therapeutics ', ' Physical Medicine Procedure ', ' Physiatric Procedure ', ' Physical therapy ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Low income ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' cost-effectiveness analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost effective analysis ', ' Cost Effective Analyses ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' cost ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' Population ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' function improvement ', ' functional improvement ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' economic implication ', ' arm ', ' Pain intensity ', ' ']",NCCIH,BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2015,156342,0.31186525093536616
"Native American Pain Disparities: Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exploring Nociceptive Processing Differences 7.0. Project Summary/Abstract Native Americans (NAs) have a higher prevalence of pain than non-Hispanic whites and other U.S. minority groups. Yet, there is a lack of pain research in NAs, with only 28 papers on pain published in over 30 years. Moreover, no study has assessed pain processing to identify whether pain sensitivity (conscious pain experience), central sensitization (augmented pain signaling in the CNS), and/or CNS pain inhibition (descending pain modulation) contribute to this disparity. Our pilot data indicate that relative to non-Hispanic whites, NAs have lower pain sensitivity (e.g., higher pain tolerance) and show reduced central sensitization (reduced CNS response to pain) on a physiological measure (i.e., temporal summation of the nociceptive flexion reflex). This suggests their CNS responds differently to noxious input, which could have significant clinical implications. Specifically, being less pain sensitive may place NAs at risk for chronic pain because they could have difficulty detecting and preventing tissue damage and/or protecting tissue damage once it has occurred. However, results from these pilot data need to be replicated in a larger sample. Aim 1 will be to determine whether healthy, pain-free Native Americans (n=120) have lowered pain sensitivity, reduced central sensitization, and enhanced pain inhibitory processes relative to a non-Hispanic white control group (n=120). Testing will occur across two sessions using well-validated, state-of-the-art, quantitative sensory testing methods to assess pain processing from subjective (e.g., pain report) and physiological (nociceptive flexion reflex) pain outcomes. Pain sensitivity will be comprehensively assessed from pain threshold, tolerance, and report in response to multiple stimulus modalities (heat, cold, mechanical pressure, ischemia, electrocutaneous). Central sensitization will be assessed from: 1) temporal summation of heat pain (a subjective measure of sensitization), 2) nociceptive flexion reflex threshold (NFR, a physiological measure of spinal nociception), and 3) temporal summation of NFR (a physiological measure of spinal cord hyperexcitability). CNS inhibition of pain and NFR will be assessed from: 1) conditioned pain modulation (i.e., pain inhibits pain) and 2) emotional controls of nociception (i.e., pleasant emotions inhibit pain, unpleasant emotions enhance pain). Aim 2 is to identify individual differences that contribute to altered pain processing in NAs. Thus, pain coping (e.g., pain catastrophizing), sociocultural variables (e.g., ethnic identity), and heredity (i.e., blood quantu level) will be examined to determine whether they are associated with group differences in pain. This research is expected to impact minority health disparities in at least 5 ways: 1) identify mechanisms contributing to pain disparities in NAs, 2) determine if pain disparities in NAs result from physiological processes (e.g., CNS pain inhibition), 3) provide evidence that pain risk is physiologically different in NAs thus identifying the need for tailored interventions, 4) inform methods to assess NAs at-risk for chronic pain, and 5) promote interventions to eliminate pain disparity in NAs.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Native Americans have a high prevalence of chronic pain. To identify mechanisms contributing to this disparity, the current study will compare healthy, pain-free, Native Americans and non-Hispanic whites on well- validated measures of pain sensitivity (conscious pain experience), central sensitization (augmented CNS pain signaling), and CNS pain inhibition (mechanisms that regulate pain).

"Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PTSD and chronic pain are highly prevalent and each is associated with long-term disability and substance abuse, exacting enormous emotional, functional, and financial tolls on individuals and society. PTSD and chronic pain are frequently co-morbid with overlap between 20% and 70%, representing an enormous public health problem. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which PTSD and chronic pain become intertwined is limited. The majority of studies of the PTSD/chronic pain co-morbidity are cross- sectional, and focused on a single chronic pain condition, limiting causal inferences and generalizability to other chronic pain conditions. Chronic pain is also related to a high prevalence of substance abuse. To understand how trauma-related PTSD, and resilience and vulnerability factors contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse requires prospective designs. Such research is vital among inner-city African American women, who are more likely to experience traumatic stress and pain, but are less likely to be treated appropriately; a phenomenon perhaps leading to greater risk for disability and substance abuse. We propose to examine 3 models related to the development of PTSD/chronic pain pairing and development of substance abuse in people initially presenting with acute pain (not caused by a traumatic event) in a 6-month prospective design. First is the Main Effects Model in which the level of PTSD symptoms at baseline will predict the likelihood of a transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse at 6 months. Second is the Moderation Model in which baseline vulnerability and resilience factors interact with PTSD symptoms to predict the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later. Third is the Mediator Model in which relationships between baseline levels of PTSD symptoms and the development of chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later are mediated by vulnerability and resilience factors at 3 months. Inner-city women (N=600) presenting to an Emergency Department with a complaint of acute bodily pain, ages 18-40 yrs, will be recruited. Only women presenting with acute pelvic/abdominal, neck/shoulder or low back pain, and who do not have a chronic pain history will be enrolled. We will assess trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, pain sensitivity, substance dependence and abuse, acute pain and psychosocial resilience and vulnerability factors across 3 waves (baseline, 3- and 6-months), and obtain additional phone assessment of pain intensity and interference at 1-, 2-, 4-, and 5-months. Inner-city women were chosen because of their high likelihood of exposure to ongoing traumatic events and the opportunity to illuminate a health disparity involving the PTSD/chronic pain pairing among inner-city minority women in particular. The public health problem posed by co-morbid PTSD, chronic pain and substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic pain and developing substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PTSD and chronic pain frequently co-occur with 20-70% of people with chronic pain conditions reporting trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. The public health problem posed by co-occurring PTSD, chronic pain and concomitant substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Results from this prospective study of how PTSD influences the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse will shed light on this well-documented but poorly understood co-morbidity. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions.",Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women,9095272,R01DA039522,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Age ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Neck ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvis ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Shoulder ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' psychosocial ', ' inner city ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain interference ', ' Pain intensity ', ' traumatic event ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' pain symptom ', ' painful symptom ', ' ']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,567090,0.334506989553484
"Virtual Perspective-Taking to Reduce Race and SES Disparities in Pain Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed project is to test a novel perspective-taking intervention aimed at reducing racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Previous studies found that Black and low SES patients are less likely to receive guideline-concordant pain care relative to White and high SES patients, respectively. Studies also found that clinicians contribute to these treatment disparities, which directly impact patient outcomes. Few interventions effectively reduce racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Interventions that target clinicians are especially scarce. According to research and theory, enhancing clinician perspective-taking is a promising strategy for improving the care of Black and low SES patients, and this strategy should be pursued during medical training to maximize its effectiveness. Unfortunately, there are numerous limitations and practical constraints to traditional perspective-taking interventions, which reduce their implementation and effectiveness. To overcome these barriers, we developed an innovative methodology that utilizes computer-simulated patients and environments to assess, understand, and remediate pain treatment disparities. In the proposed project, we aim to leverage this approach to test a theoretically-informed, evidence-based intervention to reduce racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Using computer-simulated patients and environments, our intervention provides real-time feedback to trainees about their pain treatment biases, includes one-on-one interactions with virtual patients with pain, and includes videos of these patients engaging in daily life activities with pain. Our approach allows for the intervention to be individually-tailored to each trainee, thereby enhancing its impact. It also allows for individual trainees to gain exposure to a greater range of racially and socioeconomically diverse patients than can normally be obtained in traditional training settings. Based on previous research and sound theory, we hypothesize that our perspective-taking intervention will increase trainees' knowledge of their own biases, enhance trainees' empathy toward patients, and reduce trainees' anxiety/threat toward patients, and that these changes will be the primary mechanisms underlying reductions in pain treatment disparities. This project represents a critical next step in the nation's goal of reducing racial ad SES disparities and improving pain care. Our intervention could be readily incorporated into medical school and continuing education curricula for widespread dissemination. Our approach could also be leveraged to reduce disparities for other conditions of public health significance, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Given that clinicians are key participants in patient care and are a primary source of health disparities, the proposed project has direct implications for improving care for vulnerable patients. This project will also inform scientific understanding of the mechanisms (e.g., bias awareness, patient empathy, patient anxiety/threat) underlying treatment disparities, as well as medical education to enhance the delivery of equitable, patient-centered care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses an important societal issue and represents a critical next step in the nation's goal of reducing health disparities and improving pain care. The results will have direct implications for patient care, medical education, and scientific understanding of racial and socioeconomic disparities in pain treatment.",Virtual Perspective-Taking to Reduce Race and SES Disparities in Pain Care,9042874,R01MD008931,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' Affect ', ' Americas ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' Anxiety ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Skills ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Financial cost ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Decision Making ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Continuance of education ', ' Continuing Education ', ' Medical Education ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Face Pain ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Feedback ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Methodology ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' sound ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Work ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' racism ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Patient-Centered Care ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Source ', ' experience ', ' care seeking ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Categories ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' missing work ', ' Employee Absenteeism ', ' Absenteeism at work ', ' Address ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' virtual ', ' virtual human ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' group intervention ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' implicit bias ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' ']",NIMHD,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2016,365066,0.36796028325355734
"Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and functional limitation in the United States. There are significant individual and ethnic group differences in the experience of OA. An improved understanding of factors contributing to the disparities and a biomarker reflecting the variability is needed. The research goals and career development training objectives identified in this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award application have been developed to obtain the training and experience to pursue investigations of the biological interface of chronic pain and psychosocial stress in knee OA. Entitled Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study, the proposed study expands on current research supported in part through the Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) specific to Dr. Sibille's research interests and career ambitions. Additionally, the proposed research aligns with the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) Long Range Plan for Fiscal Years 2010-2014 and the 2010 NIAMS Roundtable Summary.  My career goals are to: 1) excel in an academic medical setting as a clinical/translational pain investigator with expertise in osteoarthritis involved in patient-oriented research and 2) contribute to the research and medical community through scholarship and education with an overall goal of improving the management, functioning, and quality of life for individuals with osteoarthritis and other pain-related conditions.

A comprehensive training plan has been developed that includes didactic coursework, clinical and laboratory experience, directed study; individual and group mentoring meetings; involvement in lab meetings, research interest groups, journal clubs; attendance and presentations at professional conferences; manuscript and grant development; research responsibilities; and academic/department contributions. Completion of the proposed training plan will include obtaining a Certificate of Clinical Translational Research by 2014 through the University of Florida Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The training environment at the University of Florida is outstanding. In addition to the educational programs and resources available through the CTSI, I have the opportunity to train and work with accomplished basic and clinical researchers through the Comprehensive Center for Pain Research, the College of Dentistry, the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence, and the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center.  The proposed research study is novel, multidisciplinary, and translational. The objectives of the study are to prospectively evaluate associations of pain and functional limitations with a developing measure of system burden in ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA and explore the role of various biopsychosocial factors that may be protective or increase vulnerability for pain and functional decline.  There are numerous opportunities with significant clinical implications to extend the translational research efforts proposed. Long-term goals are to elucidate biological markers of system burden in knee OA, delineate resilience and vulnerability factors for prevention and treatment, and establish a composite of biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions. Importantly, the information generated by this research will make a significant scientific contribution as this represents the first study to prospectively examine biological markers of system burden, knee OA status, pain severity, and functional limitations among ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoarthritis is a prevalent condition and a leading cause of disability. We will evaluate changes in pain, functioning, and biological measures reflecting system burden over a four year period in a large group of ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee osteoarthritis. This information will provide an improved understanding of individual differences in osteoarthritis symptoms, help identify targets for prevention and treatment, and provide a measure for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions.",Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study,9038256,K23AR062099,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult

"Prospective Study of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Chronic Pain and Pain Burden ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden on racial and ethnic minorities. Substantial inequities exist in the pain treatment received by African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. Data suggest that members of these minority groups are not only more likely to develop chronic pain but also to have this pain accompanied by greater pain burden, i.e., greater suffering, poorer life quality, and worse functional impairment. Only modest headway has been made in understanding why race and ethnicity confer pain inequities and how best to address these disparities. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to contribute to the reduction or outright elimination o racial and ethnic pain disparities. The near-term goal of the planned research is to identify a small set of the most promising intervention targets, from among the plethora of posited explanations, for reducing or eliminating racial/ethnic pain disparities. The planned study would be, to our knowledge, the first ever prospective examination of factors posited to underlie racial and ethnic disparities in the transition from acute to chronic pain. The study would also be the first to investigate these issues in the important context of recovery following serious physical injury requiring hospitalization. For the proposed research, a sample of 900 adult survivors of serious physical injury, comprised of roughly equal proportions of African-Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Whites, will be recruited during hospitalization from large trauma centers in Los Angeles, CA and Philadelphia, PA. Interviews will be conducted during hospitalization and at 3-, and 12-month follow-up. Medical records will provide information on injury severity and medication use in-hospital which may influence the course of pain. The specific aims are (1) to determine whether African-American and Latino physical injury survivors experience more severe pain following injury relative to their non-Latino White counterparts; (2) to determine whether African-American and Latino injury survivors experience greater pain burden relative to their non- Latino White counterparts; (3) to determine whether African-American and Latino differences in pain severity or pain burden can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for interventions aimed at reduction or elimination of pain outcome disparities; and (4) To determine whether pain outcomes in at-risk minority groups can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for group-tailored interventions to reduce pain severity and pain burden irrespective of whether these candidates contribute to between-group pain disparities. The knowledge gained from the proposed research has high potential to accelerate efforts aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic pain disparities by identifying promising targets for prevention and intervention efforts to close the pain gap.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden for African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. The proposed prospective investigation will study African-American, Latino, and non-Latino White physical injury survivors from initial hospitalization for a period of one year to identify promising intervention targets to reduce or eliminate racial/ethnic pain disparities.                ",Prospective Study of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Chronic Pain and Pain Burden,9006361,R01MD010372,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medical Records ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' trauma centers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' research study ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' racial minority ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2016,702643,0.4157326854888374
"Self-Applied Wearable Ultrasound Therapy for Osteoarthritis Management in Underserved Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints which affects 27 million Americans, causing chronic pain, limited mobility and overall reduction in the quality of life. Americans with OA currently manage their symptoms through lifestyle changes (weight loss, exercise, etc.), physiotherapy, and medications to reduce pain and inflammation. Although OA affects individuals from all races and backgrounds, minorities and individuals lacking access to quality healthcare experience more negative outcomes and worse disease progressions, including severe pain and working limitations. Therapeutic ultrasound has shown promise as a non-pharmaceutical treatment for OA, but limitations on the accessibility, cost and length of treatment have prevented therapeutic ultrasound from becoming widespread. The investigative team proposes to develop a portable, wearable, self-applied ultrasound device to deliver multi-hour Sustained Acoustic Medicine for OsteoArthritis (SAMOA). The teams Phase I proposal demonstrated that the SAMOA device could be engineered for daily therapeutic self-application by the participants at home, and that SAMOA significantly reduced the pain of knee OA over the placebo device. This Phase II project further develops SAMOA and moves towards commercialization of the technology for the symptomatic management of OA. First, the SAMOA device will be engineered for improved ergonomic function in the arthritic community, ensuring that all user-interface elements are streamlined for those who may have reduced manual strength or dexterity. Second, the device will be evaluated in a larger clinical trial, providing a statistical demonstration of the treatment's benefit across minority groups which will be essential for regulatory approval and acceptance in the medical community. Third, the SAMOA device will be tested in the field for a real-world evaluation of how physicians prescribe, and patients adopt and interact with the device, providing a critical final test of the system. The SAMOA medical device will have a cost under $100 to purchase and under $20 per month to operate, making it broadly accessible and less costly to operate for 1 year than 3 months of many prescription medications. After the successful completion of Phase II, SAMOA technology will have the potential to be adopted as a pharmaceutical-free alternative to traditional OA care. Furthermore, the ease of use and low cost of this device will make it accessible to minorities and underserved communities, reducing disparities in healthcare across America.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work is relevant to the symptomatic management of osteoarthritis (OA), which impacts over 27 million Americans. This research seeks to improve the care of osteoarthritis for minorities, non-minorities, and patients with healt disparities by developing a novel, non-pharmaceutical, long duration therapeutic ultrasound device for the treatment of chronic OA pain. The technology has been preliminarily tested with positive results, and now will be refined for general use by the arthritic patient and clinically evaluated as a drug-free approach to OA care.

"Everyday Quality of Life in Blacks and Whites with Osteoarthritis DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research examines relationships among pain, everyday activities and mood states, and long-term quality of life among African American (AA; Black) and non-Hispanic White (NHW; White) older adults with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Recent evidence suggests considerable divergence in the experience and effects of this potentially very debilitating disorder among AAs and NHWs. Unfortunately, there has been little in-depth research on racial/ethnic (R/E) differences previous work on racial/ethnic (R/E) disparities in basic experience of OA symptoms, and in the emotional impact of those symptoms and related disability. This research addresses that gap in a longitudinal study of OA pain, functional disability and emotional well-being of AAs and NHWs. Working from a biopsychosocial model, we shall use functional assessments, self-reports, and real-time assessments of activities, symptoms and mood states to construct a comprehensive view of how OA affects physical and emotional functioning. Specific aims are (1) to describe racial/ethnic differences in associations among pain, disability, and emotional well-being of persons with OA of the knee; (2) to identify origins of those differences in (a) biological factors such as disease process and general health, (b) social factors such as demographic characteristics, and (ii) psychological factors, including stable personal characteristics and transitory (within-day) affective, cognitive and behavioral responses to knee symptoms; (3) to use experience sampling methods (ESM) and actigraphy to investigate how racial/ethnic differences in global associations among pain, functional limitations and emotional distress are reflected in the daily lives of OA sufferers, and (4) to explore how the interplay of transitory (within-day) symptoms, activities and mood states influences long-term physical and emotional well-being. These aims will be achieved in a 5-year, multi- site project examining cross-sectional and longitudinal associations among demographic and health characteristics, OA-related pain and disability, restriction of everyday activities, and emotional well-being. A sample of 220 AA and 220 NHW adults aged 50+ with physician-diagnosed OA of the knee will complete a comprehensive baseline assessment tapping biological, psychological and social vulnerability to OA pain and its effects; objective functional limitations; pain; activity restriction, and emotiona distress. Immediately post- baseline, participants will complete a 7-day ESM procedure comprising actigraphic assessment of activity levels along with 4 daily telephone contacts to assess current symptoms, activities, and moods. One year later, participants will repeat all measures, including the ESM component, to capture changes in overall physical and emotional well-being as well as patterns of daily activity and moods. Resulting data will offer unprecedented insight into the global factors that differentiate AAs' and NHWs' experience of OA symptoms, and how daily experiences are concatenated to influence longer-term physical and emotional well-being. Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common chronic illness and the leading cause of pain and disability among older adults. As the population ages, prevalence of OA is rising sharply; this, in turn, portends rising rates of disability and health care costs. Osteoarthritis's characteristic pain and functional limitations place persons at increased risk of significant emotional distress; that distress may, in turn, fuel OA pain and hasten functional decline. There are clear differences in the epidemiology of OA among African American (AA) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) older adults, but surprisingly little is known about racial/ethnic disparities in the functional and emotional effects of OA. This study fills that gap by examining how OA of the knee affects everyday activities and emotional well-being of older AAs and NHWs, and how those effects change over a one-year period.",Everyday Quality of Life in Blacks and Whites with Osteoarthritis,9060843,R01AG041655,"['functional capacity ', ' functional ability ', ' daily living functionality ', ' Activities of everyday life ', ' Activities of Daily Living ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Affective Symptoms ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' joint inflammation ', ' arthritic ', ' Arthritis ', ' Attention ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Biological Factors ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Health ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' indexing ', ' Knee ', ' Leisure Activities ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Methods ', ' Moods ', ' Persons ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Personality ', ' Physicians ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' fabric ', ' Textiles ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Procedures ', ' Site ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' Shapes ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' feeling upset ', ' feeling distress ', ' emotional distress ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' actigraphy ', ' Address ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' functional status decline ', ' decline in functional status ', ' decline in function ', ' functional decline ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Affective ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' cognitive process ', ' behavioral response ', ' behavior response ', ' mood symptom ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA IN TUSCALOOSA,R01,2016,407731,0.22669871114796178
"Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is a leading cause of pain and functional limitation in the United States. There are significant individual and ethnic group differences in the experience of OA. An improved understanding of factors contributing to the disparities and a biomarker reflecting the variability is needed. The research goals and career development training objectives identified in this K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award application have been developed to obtain the training and experience to pursue investigations of the biological interface of chronic pain and psychosocial stress in knee OA. Entitled Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study, the proposed study expands on current research supported in part through the Basic Behavioral and Social Science Opportunity Network (OppNet) specific to Dr. Sibille's research interests and career ambitions. Additionally, the proposed research aligns with the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) Long Range Plan for Fiscal Years 2010-2014 and the 2010 NIAMS Roundtable Summary.  My career goals are to: 1) excel in an academic medical setting as a clinical/translational pain investigator with expertise in osteoarthritis involved in patient-oriented research and 2) contribute to the research and medical community through scholarship and education with an overall goal of improving the management, functioning, and quality of life for individuals with osteoarthritis and other pain-related conditions. My career development training objectives incorporate activities and experiences pertinent to my research goals and necessary to obtain R01 funding by 2016.  Objective 1: Develop a comprehensive knowledge-base in osteoarthritis  Objective 2: Broaden skills in multi-modal assessment of pain and functional limitations  Objective 3: Increase understanding of genetics and stress-related biological systems  Objective 4: Enhance management skills necessary to function as an independent researcher  Objective 5: Strengthen skills in clinical/translational research, statistics, and scholarship  My career development research and training efforts will be guided by an exceptional mentoring team, Roger Fillingim, Ph.D., Primary Mentor, will provide guidance and oversight in the multi-modal assessment of pain and functional limitations; the integration of biological and psychosocial factors; and my overall career development. Roland Staud, M.D., will oversee the development of a comprehensive knowledge-base in osteoarthritis. Christiaan Leeuwenburgh, Ph.D., Co-Mentor, will provide direction in areas related to metabolic processes, evaluating biological markers, and developing the skills necessary for translational investigation. Taimour Langaee, Ph.D., Co-Mentor, will assist with training and development in the areas of immunology, genetics, and telomere measures. Bruce McEwen, Ph.D., Consultant/Co-Mentor, will direct my training specific to neuroendocrine functioning, the effects of stress on health, and the application of the allostatic load model in the study of knee osteoarthritis. My transition to research independence will also be benefited by relationships developed in the OA Network, an advisory and collaborative group of clinician/researchers.  A comprehensive training plan has been developed that includes didactic coursework, clinical and laboratory experience, directed study; individual and group mentoring meetings; involvement in lab meetings, research interest groups, journal clubs; attendance and presentations at professional conferences; manuscript and grant development; research responsibilities; and academic/department contributions. Completion of the proposed training plan will include obtaining a Certificate of Clinical Translational Research by 2014 through the University of Florida Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The training environment at the University of Florida is outstanding. In addition to the educational programs and resources available through the CTSI, I have the opportunity to train and work with accomplished basic and clinical researchers through the Comprehensive Center for Pain Research, the College of Dentistry, the Pain Research and Intervention Center of Excellence, and the Claude D. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center.  The proposed research study is novel, multidisciplinary, and translational. The objectives of the study are to prospectively evaluate associations of pain and functional limitations with a developing measure of system burden in ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA and explore the role of various biopsychosocial factors that may be protective or increase vulnerability for pain and functional decline.  There are numerous opportunities with significant clinical implications to extend the translational research efforts proposed. Long-term goals are to elucidate biological markers of system burden in knee OA, delineate resilience and vulnerability factors for prevention and treatment, and establish a composite of biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions. Importantly, the information generated by this research will make a significant scientific contribution as this represents the first study to prospectively examine biological markers of system burden, knee OA status, pain severity, and functional limitations among ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee OA. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Osteoarthritis is a prevalent condition and a leading cause of disability. We will evaluate changes in pain, functioning, and biological measures reflecting system burden over a four year period in a large group of ethnically diverse older adults with and without knee osteoarthritis. This information will provide an improved understanding of individual differences in osteoarthritis symptoms, help identify targets for prevention and treatment, and provide a measure for evaluating the efficacy of clinical interventions.",Biological Markers of System Burden in Symptomatic Knee OA: A Prospective Study,9181223,K23AR062099,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult

"Identification of Patellofemoral Pain Risk Factors Developed During Maturation ﻿    DESCRIPTION:  Patellofemoral pain (PFP) is a debilitating condition that peaks in incidence during the middle school years and eventually affects nearly 1 out of 4 school-aged youth. PFP is recognized as one of the most common disorders of the knee with cumulative health care costs estimated to exceed several billion dollars per year. Symptoms of PFP occur 2 to 10 times more often in females and typically restrict adolescents from participation in physical activity. The high recurrence rate of patellofemoral pain and the poor long-term prognosis indicate that prevention strategies would significantly reduce the morbidity associated with PFP developed during youth. Unfortunately, the risk factors that underlie the development of patellofemoral dysfunction and resultant PFP in young females remain unknown. Our long-term goals are to determine the risk factors and mechanisms that underlie the high rate of debilitating knee pain in females in order to develop targeted interventions for prevention. The overall objective of this application is to delineate the specific modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors that contribute to the development of patellofemoral dysfunction and resultant PFP. Our prior findings drive our central hypothesis that predisposing morphologic characteristics associated with growth and maturation, in concert with underdeveloped lower-extremity stabilizing mechanisms, initiate abnormal patellofemoral joint mechanics that lead to the onset of PFP. The expected outcome from the work proposed in Aim 1 will be identification of the onset of specific modifiable risk factors that cluster to differentiate young females at increased risk for the development of PFP. Following determination of modifiable risk factors, we will evaluate if an existing intervention is differentially effective to ameliorate aberrant biomechanics relative to maturational status (Aim 2). The contribution of this application is significant because it is expected to remove focus from unrelated contributors to PFP incidence that would otherwise undermine future definitive clinical investigations that target PFP risk factors. Successful completion of the proposed Aims will strategically position us to develop a competitive R01 application that focuses on the implementation of mechanism-driven PFP risk prediction algorithms and targeted interventions that reduce predisposing deficits to development of PFP in high risk female populations. The implication of a future R01 trial derived from these data is such that up to 25% of the female populous who are at risk to develop PFP will benefit from the resultant findings. The proposed research is innovative because it represents a new and substantive departure from the status quo via prospective identification of predisposing risk factors that will position us to evaluate te effectiveness of mechanism based interventions prior to development of PFP symptoms in a clinical trial. Once these validated strategies are achieved, we will have increased potential to prevent PFP, an important step on the preventative pathway for the reduction of physical inactivity in youth and adults. This proposal aligns with NIH initiatives to reduce physical inactivity in youth, which is the fourth leading cause of global mortality. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  Anterior knee pain is a debilitating condition that peaks in incidence during the middle school years and eventually affects nearly 1 out 4 school aged youth, 75% of whom limit or cease physical activity as a direct result. The proposed research is relevant to public health because the discovery of risk factors will lead to fewer young women who succumb to the symptoms that limit them from participation in physical activities. This proposal aligns with the NIH's mission to create and maintain active lifestyles in our youth to decrease the risk of childhood and adult obesity.",Identification of Patellofemoral Pain Risk Factors Developed During Maturation,9014512,R21AR065068,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' biomechanical ', ' Biomechanics ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Hip ', ' Coxa ', ' Hip region structure ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Knee ', ' Knee Injuries ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Membrum inferius ', ' Lower Limb ', ' Lower Extremity ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' male ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Patients ', ' Probability ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Left ', ' Anterior ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' knee pain ', ' school age ', ' School-Age Population ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Diagnostic ', ' Knowledge ', ' mechanical ', ' Mechanics ', ' Height ', ' novel ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' prevention directed at individuals ', ' indicated preventive measure ', ' indicated preventive interventions ', ' indicated prevention ', ' girls ', ' middle school ', ' junior high ', ' junior high school ', ' patellofemoral pain ', ' Patellofemoral Syndrome ', ' Anterior Knee Pain Syndrome ', ' Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Drops ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Preventive ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Pathologic ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NIAMS ', ' National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ', ' neuromuscular ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' modifiable risk ', ' high risk ', ' young woman ', ' adolescent women ', ' adolescent woman ', ' clinical investigation ', ' prognostic tool ', ' pathomechanics ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' Exercise intervention ', ' pre-clinical trial ', ' prediction algorithm ', ' predictor algorithm ', ' predictive algorithm ', ' sex disparity ', ' disparities in sex ', ' pain symptom ', ' painful symptom ', ' ']",NIAMS,CINCINNATI CHILDRENS HOSP MED CTR,R21,2016,171600,0.14621232959776773
"iCanCope with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary Pain related to sickle cell disease (SCD) is most often treated in the home by patients and families, but this management is typically suboptimal. SCD mostly affects people of African descent. This population is known to suffer many racial and cultural inequities related to the medical management of SCD pain. Cognitive- behavioral therapies (CBT) that promote pain self-management can lead to symptom reduction, improved quality of life, and decreased healthcare use. However, most people with SCD do not receive CBT-based treatment due to barriers such as poor accessibility, limited availability of professionals, and high costs. Youth with SCD must assume more responsibility for managing their SCD pain, which typically becomes more chronic in adulthood. However, many youth never develop these important self-management skills during childhood and are poorly prepared to cope with SCD pain as adults. There is a critical need for innovative pain self-management programs that are accessible and tailored for youth with SCD pain. Access to web and mobile technologies among African Americans is high. In a qualitative study conducted by our group, youth with SCD, parents, and healthcare professionals indicated that these technologies could be applied to meet their pain self-management needs. Based on our team experiences in developing and testing web- and mobile- based pain management programs in other populations, we hypothesize that this approach will also be effective for delivering pain self-management to youth with SCD. In this application, our goal is to improve pain self-management and functioning in youth (aged 12-18) with SCD by developing and testing a tailored web and smartphone-based application (iCanCope with SCD). First, we plan to apply a user-centered design approach to refine and beta test the program. The program will include: (I) goal setting, (II) peer-based social support, and (III) pain self-management training. Second, we will determine program feasibility and initial program effectiveness through a pilot three-site randomized controlled trial. Preliminary effectiveness will be determined in 160 youth randomized to treatment compared to attention control. We hypothesize that youth who receive iCanCope with SCD will achieve greater reduction in pain intensity, pain-related disability and increased adaptive coping strategies (primary outcomes) as well as significant improvement in physical and emotional functioning and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up compared to youth who receive the attention-control condition. Third, we will explore moderators and mediators of treatment effect. This project represents a significant advance in delivering tailored psychological therapies for youth with SCD. Our long-term goal is to develop effective and flexible treatments that can be delivered at low cost to reduce SCD pain and disability, and better equip youth to cope with SCD as adults.

"Ethnic differences in endogenous pain regulation: PET imaging of opioid receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is the number one motivator for healthcare utilization, affects over 100 million Americans, costs in excess of one trillion dollars annually and exacts profound suffering and physical disability. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that ethnic groups show substantial variability in the experience of acute and clinical pain, with African Americans (AAs) having increased prevalence of a number of clinical pain conditions and reporting higher levels of pain severity and pain-related disability in response to pain when compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Evidence suggests that disparities between these groups are independent of other demographic factors such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, education, employment, marital status, and other potential confounders, such as medical comorbidities and disease duration. These ethnic differences have been mirrored in the laboratory where controlled, systematic noxious stimuli are applied to healthy individuals. Ethnic differences in laboratory pain responses are well-established, suggesting increased sensitivity to noxious stimulation among AAs compared to NHWs. In our previous work, we have demonstrated enhanced responsiveness in AAs to noxious stimulation on several tasks that indirectly assess endogenous pain-inhibitory systems that are at least partially opioid-mediated. Ethnic differences in endogenous opioid neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system suggest that these systems function less efficiently among AAs and may account for a substantial proportion of the ethnic differences observed in pain and analgesic responses. In addition, pharmacogenetic research shows substantial ethnic group differences in the metabolism, clinical effectiveness, and side-effect profiles of many drugs; including analgesics. The overwhelming majority of clinically used opioids elicit their effects through activation of the mu-opioid receptor, making it an extremely relevant target for investigation. We propose to examine ethnic differences in the supraspinal endogenous opioid system using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mu-opioid receptors employing the mu-selective agonist [11C] carfentanil. Healthy AAs and sex, age, SES matched, NHW participants will undergo one baseline (non-pain) and one capsaicin-induced pain PET session using [11C] carfentanil. The current proposal will measure mu-opioid binding potential and examine its role in ethnic group differences in pain sensitivity. Our overarching objective is to investigate the endogenous opioid system as the mechanism underlying the association between ethnicity and pain sensitivity, thereby enhancing our understanding of the neurobiology of ethnic differences. These findings will have far reaching implications; including elucidating a tangible, physiological mechanism underlying ethnic differences in pain, for prescribing analgesics and advancing personalized medicine. Enhancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying ethnic differences in pain is likely to assist in the refinement of targeted interventios to alleviate clinical pain in at-risk populations, and aid in reducing pain-related health disparites. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain is a major public health problem producing enormous economic costs and profound suffering; considerable evidence demonstrates disparities in the experience of acute and clinical pain, with African Americans experiencing a greater burden of pain when compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The current proposal will measure the endogenous opioid system and examine its role in disparities in pain report. Our goal is to investigate the endogenous opioid system as the mechanism underlying the disparities in pain sensitivity, thereby enhancing our understanding of the neurobiology of ethnic/racial differences in pain, which will assist in the refinement of targeted interventions to alleviate clinical pain i at-risk populations, and aid in reducing pain-related health disparities.",Ethnic differences in endogenous pain regulation: PET imaging of opioid receptors,9054672,R01MD009063,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Brain ', ' Capsaicin ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Employment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Laboratories ', ' Marital Status ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Metabolism ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Nerve Transmitter Substances ', ' Neurotransmitters ', ' Neuroendocrine System ', ' Neuroendocrine ', ' Neurosecretory Systems ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacogenetics ', ' Play ', ' positron emitting tomography ', ' positron emission tomographic imaging ', ' positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging ', ' Rad.-PET ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Scan ', ' Positron Emission Tomography Medical Imaging ', ' PETT ', ' PETSCAN ', ' PET imaging ', ' PET Scan ', ' PET ', ' Positron-Emission Tomography ', ' psycho-physiological ', ' physiopsychology ', ' Psychophysiological ', ' Physiological Psychology ', ' Physiologic Psychology ', ' Psychophysiology ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Opiate Receptors ', ' Opioid Receptor ', ' Research ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' thalamic ', ' Thalamus ', ' Thalamic structure ', ' Work ', ' carfentanil ', ' carfentanyl ', ' 4-methoxycarbonylfentanyl ', ' 4-methoxycarbonyl fentanyl ', ' Receptors, Opioid, mu ', ' μ receptors ', ' μ opioid receptors ', ' mu Receptors ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' endogenous opioid ', ' Endogenous Opiates ', ' Peripheral Nervous System ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Opioid ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Agonist ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Participant ', ' economic cost ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Reporting ', ' Regulation ', ' response ', ' disease length ', ' disease duration ', ' illness length ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Adverse effects ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Brain region ', ' Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Opioid Receptor Binding ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' imaging ', ' Image ', ' cost ', ' Clinical effectiveness ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' pain inhibition ', ' inhibit pain ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' opioid use ', ' ']",NIMHD,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,405000,0.4633439640882996
"Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PTSD and chronic pain are highly prevalent and each is associated with long-term disability and substance abuse, exacting enormous emotional, functional, and financial tolls on individuals and society. PTSD and chronic pain are frequently co-morbid with overlap between 20% and 70%, representing an enormous public health problem. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which PTSD and chronic pain become intertwined is limited. The majority of studies of the PTSD/chronic pain co-morbidity are cross- sectional, and focused on a single chronic pain condition, limiting causal inferences and generalizability to other chronic pain conditions. Chronic pain is also related to a high prevalence of substance abuse. To understand how trauma-related PTSD, and resilience and vulnerability factors contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse requires prospective designs. Such research is vital among inner-city African American women, who are more likely to experience traumatic stress and pain, but are less likely to be treated appropriately; a phenomenon perhaps leading to greater risk for disability and substance abuse. We propose to examine 3 models related to the development of PTSD/chronic pain pairing and development of substance abuse in people initially presenting with acute pain (not caused by a traumatic event) in a 6-month prospective design. First is the Main Effects Model in which the level of PTSD symptoms at baseline will predict the likelihood of a transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse at 6 months. Second is the Moderation Model in which baseline vulnerability and resilience factors interact with PTSD symptoms to predict the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later. Third is the Mediator Model in which relationships between baseline levels of PTSD symptoms and the development of chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later are mediated by vulnerability and resilience factors at 3 months. Inner-city women (N=600) presenting to an Emergency Department with a complaint of acute bodily pain, ages 18-40 yrs, will be recruited. Only women presenting with acute pelvic/abdominal, neck/shoulder or low back pain, and who do not have a chronic pain history will be enrolled. We will assess trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, pain sensitivity, substance dependence and abuse, acute pain and psychosocial resilience and vulnerability factors across 3 waves (baseline, 3- and 6-months), and obtain additional phone assessment of pain intensity and interference at 1-, 2-, 4-, and 5-months. Inner-city women were chosen because of their high likelihood of exposure to ongoing traumatic events and the opportunity to illuminate a health disparity involving the PTSD/chronic pain pairing among inner-city minority women in particular. The public health problem posed by co-morbid PTSD, chronic pain and substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic pain and developing substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PTSD and chronic pain frequently co-occur with 20-70% of people with chronic pain conditions reporting trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. The public health problem posed by co-occurring PTSD, chronic pain and concomitant substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Results from this prospective study of how PTSD influences the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse will shed light on this well-documented but poorly understood co-morbidity. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions.",Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women,9353013,R01DA039522,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' Age ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Neck ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvis ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Shoulder ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Woman ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' chronic pain ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' psychosocial ', ' inner city ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Mediation ', ' Reporting ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain interference ', ' Pain intensity ', ' traumatic event ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' pain symptom ', ' painful symptom ', ' ']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2016,189999,0.334506989553484
"Identifying Opportunities to Improve Hydroxyurea Therapy Initiation and Adherence among Children with Sickle Cell Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY Approximately 1 in 500 African American births are diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD), which is associated with substantial morbidity and risk of early mortality. Among affected individuals, sickling of the red blood cells causes excruciating, chronic pain, which is the most common symptom of SCD. The presence of pain indicates suboptimal disease management and results in substantial financial burden on the healthcare system. Over 50% of children with SCD have at least one pain crisis a year; these pain crises are associated with substantially lower quality of life, as well as inadequate sleep, more school absences, chronic depression, and impaired peer relationships. The frequency, intensity, and duration of pain crises can only be controlled through appropriate disease management using the medication hydroxyurea. Use of hydroxyurea therapy by children with SCD is associated with lower rates of initial and recurrent episodes of pain, hand-foot syndrome (dactylitis), acute chest syndrome, and hospitalization compared with no hydroxyurea therapy. Given the substantial potential of hydroxyurea therapy to reduce pain crises and other clinical complications among children with SCD, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released (2014) recommendations for its use among children. All children (9 months or older) with specific subtypes of SCD should be offered hydroxyurea therapy to reduce its health-related complications, irrespective of disease severity. The existing body of evidence regarding the use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD is based on studies conducted prior to the NHLBI recommendation for use among all children. Consequently, there is a complete gap in knowledge regarding use of hydroxyurea therapy post NHLBI recommendations. Using administrative claims from states with the highest prevalence of SCD, complemented by focus groups with key stakeholders, this research project will identify multiple levels of opportunities for improvement in appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD. In addition, this project provides the framework to enable me to become a successful independent investigator and a leader in reducing health disparities among children with severe chronic conditions through development of expertise in comparative effectiveness, qualitative methods, and medication adherence theory. Combined, these research and training activities will provide a crucial foundation for a subsequent application to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to gauge the effectiveness of interventions targeted at SCD patients, their caregivers, and providers of SCD services to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among this vulnerable population. To this end, the following aims will be investigated: Research Aim 1: Quantify hydroxyurea therapy prevalence prior to NHLBI guidelines, and changes in prevalence post-NHLBI guidelines among children with SCD using Medicaid administrative claims data, as well as predictors of hydroxyurea initiation and adherence.  Specific Aim 1a: Assess baseline hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD prior to NHLBI guidelines (2005-2012). Specific Aim 1b: Evaluate changes in hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD post- NHLBI guidelines (2011-2017). Specific Aim 1c: Identify characteristics associated with hydroxyurea initiation and subsequent adherence among children with SCD. Research Aim 2: Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of hydroxyurea therapy among adherent users on reducing the incidence of pain crises, adverse outcomes, and use of health services, compared with those having limited or no use of hydroxyurea therapy. Research Aim 3: Identify barriers to initiation and adherence of hydroxyurea therapy through focus groups conducted among adolescents with SCD, caregivers of children with SCD, and SCD health services providers in Michigan. Overall Career Development Aim: To acquire the skills and experience necessary to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy in children with SCD. These aims will be achieved during 3 phases of research over 5 years under the guidance of a multi- disciplinary team of experienced mentors. Through the conduct of high quality research, formal coursework, and interaction with mentors, this K01 award will provide the PI with the necessary training to become a successful independent investigator and to develop a future R01 grant application. If successful, this line of inquiry will improve health outcomes and quality of life among children with SCD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Severe pain episodes are the most common, debilitating, and costly morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Use of hydroxyurea is the only method to prevent these pain crises among children, and interventions to increase its use are urgently needed.

"iCanCope with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary Pain related to sickle cell disease (SCD) is most often treated in the home by patients and families, but this management is typically suboptimal. SCD mostly affects people of African descent. This population is known to suffer many racial and cultural inequities related to the medical management of SCD pain. Cognitive- behavioral therapies (CBT) that promote pain self-management can lead to symptom reduction, improved quality of life, and decreased healthcare use. However, most people with SCD do not receive CBT-based treatment due to barriers such as poor accessibility, limited availability of professionals, and high costs. Youth with SCD must assume more responsibility for managing their SCD pain, which typically becomes more chronic in adulthood. However, many youth never develop these important self-management skills during childhood and are poorly prepared to cope with SCD pain as adults. There is a critical need for innovative pain self-management programs that are accessible and tailored for youth with SCD pain. Access to web and mobile technologies among African Americans is high. In a qualitative study conducted by our group, youth with SCD, parents, and healthcare professionals indicated that these technologies could be applied to meet their pain self-management needs. Based on our team experiences in developing and testing web- and mobile- based pain management programs in other populations, we hypothesize that this approach will also be effective for delivering pain self-management to youth with SCD. In this application, our goal is to improve pain self-management and functioning in youth (aged 12-18) with SCD by developing and testing a tailored web and smartphone-based application (iCanCope with SCD). First, we plan to apply a user-centered design approach to refine and beta test the program. The program will include: (I) goal setting, (II) peer-based social support, and (III) pain self-management training. Second, we will determine program feasibility and initial program effectiveness through a pilot three-site randomized controlled trial. Preliminary effectiveness will be determined in 160 youth randomized to treatment compared to attention control. We hypothesize that youth who receive iCanCope with SCD will achieve greater reduction in pain intensity, pain-related disability and increased adaptive coping strategies (primary outcomes) as well as significant improvement in physical and emotional functioning and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up compared to youth who receive the attention-control condition. Third, we will explore moderators and mediators of treatment effect. This project represents a significant advance in delivering tailored psychological therapies for youth with SCD.

"Evidence-based Approaches to Chronic Pain Management in Youth with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain is a complex and challenging problem associated with significant disability and suffering among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). There is a gap in scientific knowledge in understanding the progression of chronic SCD pain that hinders the development of effective therapeutic options. Psychological treatments are key components of comprehensive chronic pain management, but currently have limited efficacy for managing SCD pain in youth. Thus, the long-term career goal of this candidate is to become an independent clinical investigator with expertise in SCD pain to establish a novel stepped care model of delivering behavioral interventions for SCD pain management that are easily implemented in real-world clinical settings. She will begin to achieve these goals by obtaining clinical and research training in SCD pain physiology and pharmacology and training in implementation science, health disparities research, and advanced quantitative and qualitative methods to support a patient-centered approach to pain intervention development, optimization, and evaluation. Her career development plan is uniquely tailored to fulfill gaps in her training in pediatric pain under the mentorship of national and international leaders at Emory University and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. The training plan leverages the well- supported infrastructure of the largest pediatric sickle cell program in the US as well as national and institutional opportunities to ensure didactic, experiential, and specialized individual instruction. The research objectives of this application are to first rigorously characterize trajectories of chronic pain over a 24-month period in a cohort of youth with SCD (ages 10-18 years). Data will help identify modifiable psychosocial and family risk factors (e.g., elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms, caregiver stress) that predict different chronic pain trajectories to inform relevant behavioral treatment targets in a family-focused cognitive-behavioral intervention. Standard qualitative and mixed-method approaches and iterative design using focus groups, key informant interviews, and community stakeholders will be used to develop and refine intervention content and format and solicit feedback to enhance the success of future implementation in clinical settings. The result will be a family-focused, culturally informed, evidence-based intervention termed Back2Living (“Building Adaptive Coping and Knowledge To improve daily Living”) that is amenable for implementation in real-world clinical settings. A pilot proof-of-concept trial will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Back2Living with youth with chronic SCD pain and their parents. An adaptive treatment approach with 4-8 treatment sessions selected on the basis of baseline assessment will target comorbid psychosocial risk factors and allow flexibility in tailoring treatment components to meet individual family needs to reduce pain interference, pain, and healthcare use. Results of this proposal may ultimately contribute to novel comprehensive treatment approaches to treat chronic pain in pediatric SCD and improve quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although chronic pain is a significant problem that contributes to poor quality of life in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about the individual and family psychosocial factors that contribute to chronic SCD pain, which severely hinders the development of effective treatment options. This research will characterize the natural course of chronic SCD pain and determine psychosocial risk factors that impact chronic pain in youth with SCD to inform the development of an adaptive family-focused behavioral intervention that is tailored to meet individual family needs to reduce pain-related disability. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a psychosocial risk stratification to inform comprehensive treatment approaches for SCD pain management and prevention.",Evidence-based Approaches to

"Identifying Opportunities to Improve Hydroxyurea Therapy Initiation and Adherence among Children with Sickle Cell Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY Approximately 1 in 500 African American births are diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD), which is associated with substantial morbidity and risk of early mortality. Among affected individuals, sickling of the red blood cells causes excruciating, chronic pain, which is the most common symptom of SCD. The presence of pain indicates suboptimal disease management and results in substantial financial burden on the healthcare system. Over 50% of children with SCD have at least one pain crisis a year; these pain crises are associated with substantially lower quality of life, as well as inadequate sleep, more school absences, chronic depression, and impaired peer relationships. The frequency, intensity, and duration of pain crises can only be controlled through appropriate disease management using the medication hydroxyurea. Use of hydroxyurea therapy by children with SCD is associated with lower rates of initial and recurrent episodes of pain, hand-foot syndrome (dactylitis), acute chest syndrome, and hospitalization compared with no hydroxyurea therapy. Given the substantial potential of hydroxyurea therapy to reduce pain crises and other clinical complications among children with SCD, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released (2014) recommendations for its use among children. All children (9 months or older) with specific subtypes of SCD should be offered hydroxyurea therapy to reduce its health-related complications, irrespective of disease severity. The existing body of evidence regarding the use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD is based on studies conducted prior to the NHLBI recommendation for use among all children. Consequently, there is a complete gap in knowledge regarding use of hydroxyurea therapy post NHLBI recommendations. Using administrative claims from states with the highest prevalence of SCD, complemented by focus groups with key stakeholders, this research project will identify multiple levels of opportunities for improvement in appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD. In addition, this project provides the framework to enable me to become a successful independent investigator and a leader in reducing health disparities among children with severe chronic conditions through development of expertise in comparative effectiveness, qualitative methods, and medication adherence theory. Combined, these research and training activities will provide a crucial foundation for a subsequent application to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to gauge the effectiveness of interventions targeted at SCD patients, their caregivers, and providers of SCD services to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among this vulnerable population. To this end, the following aims will be investigated: Research Aim 1: Quantify hydroxyurea therapy prevalence prior to NHLBI guidelines, and changes in prevalence post-NHLBI guidelines among children with SCD using Medicaid administrative claims data, as well as predictors of hydroxyurea initiation and adherence.  Specific Aim 1a: Assess baseline hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD prior to NHLBI guidelines (2005-2012). Specific Aim 1b: Evaluate changes in hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD post- NHLBI guidelines (2011-2017). Specific Aim 1c: Identify characteristics associated with hydroxyurea initiation and subsequent adherence among children with SCD. Research Aim 2: Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of hydroxyurea therapy among adherent users on reducing the incidence of pain crises, adverse outcomes, and use of health services, compared with those having limited or no use of hydroxyurea therapy. Research Aim 3: Identify barriers to initiation and adherence of hydroxyurea therapy through focus groups conducted among adolescents with SCD, caregivers of children with SCD, and SCD health services providers in Michigan. Overall Career Development Aim: To acquire the skills and experience necessary to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy in children with SCD. These aims will be achieved during 3 phases of research over 5 years under the guidance of a multi- disciplinary team of experienced mentors. Through the conduct of high quality research, formal coursework, and interaction with mentors, this K01 award will provide the PI with the necessary training to become a successful independent investigator and to develop a future R01 grant application. If successful, this line of inquiry will improve health outcomes and quality of life among children with SCD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Severe pain episodes are the most common, debilitating, and costly morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Use of hydroxyurea is the only method to prevent these pain crises among children, and interventions to increase its use are urgently needed.

"Using Technology to Deliver Evidence-Based Interventions for Pain to Patients with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this candidate's program of research is to improve behavioral and physical health and reduce health disparities by using multimedia technology to deliver evidence-based interventions to underserved populations. The focus is sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition that disproportionately affects those of African descent. Many people living with SCD suffer from daily chronic pain as well as recurrent acute pain episodes that require medical attention. Opioid medication is the primary treatment for pain in SCD, despite its limited effectiveness and negative side-effects. The proposed K23 attempts to address the need for an alternative, non-pharmacological pain treatment in SCD. Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) has been found effective for reducing chronic pain and may be a low cost, easily accessible and scalable pain treatment in SCD. The candidate's K12 project tested a cCBT program for anxiety and depression; preliminary results suggest that patients liked using the program, but found that much of its content did not relate to their lives. To address this limitation, the proposed K23 project will adapt an existing cCBT program for pain management to create ReThink Pain SCD, a culturally-tailored, mobile-phone delivered behavioral intervention designed specifically to help African American patients self-manage chronic sickle cell pain. Aim 1: Modify and tailor the generic cCBT pain program, using qualitative research methods to understand the needs and barriers to pain management in patients with SCD, as well as the opportunities to engage this population using multimedia. These data will inform the development of the features and content of ReThink Pain SCD. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot pragmatic clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing this pain intervention into routine SCD care. Forty patients with SCD will be randomized to either receive 8 sessions of the cCBT program or 8 online education modules on a smartphone. Primary outcomes of the trial include feasibility (recruitment, retention, provider and patient feedback) and acceptability (sessions completed) of the ReThink Pain SCD program. In order to achieve the goals of this research plan and transition to independence, the candidate requires further training in user-centered design, implementation science, design and conduct of pragmatic clinical trials, and team management and leadership. This proposal includes an exceptional team of mentors and consultants. Primary mentor Dr. Bruce Rollman is founding Director of the Center for Behavioral Health and Smart Technology. Co-mentor Dr. Robert Noll is a clinical psychologist with expertise in behavioral intervention trials. Co-mentor Dr. Laura De Castro is a nationally recognized trialist and expert in sickle cell disease. This training and research plan will form the basis for a future multicenter clinical trial testing the efficacy of ReThink Pain SCD for improving pain outcomes among adults with SCD, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K23 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to determine whether a tailored behavioral intervention delivered over mobile phones can be an effective therapy for chronic pain in a predominately African American patient population, specifically patients living with sickle cell disease. Ultimately, this research will inform the delivery of evidence-based pain treatment in racial and ethnic minorities living with chronic pain.",Using Technology to Deliver Evidence-Based Interventions

"Self-Applied Wearable Ultrasound Therapy for Osteoarthritis Management in Underserved Populations ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints which affects 27 million Americans, causing chronic pain, limited mobility and overall reduction in the quality of life. Americans with OA currently manage their symptoms through lifestyle changes (weight loss, exercise, etc.), physiotherapy, and medications to reduce pain and inflammation. Although OA affects individuals from all races and backgrounds, minorities and individuals lacking access to quality healthcare experience more negative outcomes and worse disease progressions, including severe pain and working limitations. Therapeutic ultrasound has shown promise as a non-pharmaceutical treatment for OA, but limitations on the accessibility, cost and length of treatment have prevented therapeutic ultrasound from becoming widespread. The investigative team proposes to develop a portable, wearable, self-applied ultrasound device to deliver multi-hour Sustained Acoustic Medicine for OsteoArthritis (SAMOA). The teams Phase I proposal demonstrated that the SAMOA device could be engineered for daily therapeutic self-application by the participants at home, and that SAMOA significantly reduced the pain of knee OA over the placebo device. This Phase II project further develops SAMOA and moves towards commercialization of the technology for the symptomatic management of OA. First, the SAMOA device will be engineered for improved ergonomic function in the arthritic community, ensuring that all user-interface elements are streamlined for those who may have reduced manual strength or dexterity. Second, the device will be evaluated in a larger clinical trial, providing a statistical demonstration of the treatment's benefit across minority groups which will be essential for regulatory approval and acceptance in the medical community. Third, the SAMOA device will be tested in the field for a real-world evaluation of how physicians prescribe, and patients adopt and interact with the device, providing a critical final test of the system. The SAMOA medical device will have a cost under $100 to purchase and under $20 per month to operate, making it broadly accessible and less costly to operate for 1 year than 3 months of many prescription medications. After the successful completion of Phase II, SAMOA technology will have the potential to be adopted as a pharmaceutical-free alternative to traditional OA care. Furthermore, the ease of use and low cost of this device will make it accessible to minorities and underserved communities, reducing disparities in healthcare across America.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed work is relevant to the symptomatic management of osteoarthritis (OA), which impacts over 27 million Americans. This research seeks to improve the care of osteoarthritis for minorities, non-minorities, and patients with healt disparities by developing a novel, non-pharmaceutical, long duration therapeutic ultrasound device for the treatment of chronic OA pain. The technology has been preliminarily tested with positive results, and now will be refined for general use by the arthritic patient and clinically evaluated as a drug-free approach to OA care.

"Ethnic differences in endogenous pain regulation: PET imaging of opioid receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is the number one motivator for healthcare utilization, affects over 100 million Americans, costs in excess of one trillion dollars annually and exacts profound suffering and physical disability. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that ethnic groups show substantial variability in the experience of acute and clinical pain, with African Americans (AAs) having increased prevalence of a number of clinical pain conditions and reporting higher levels of pain severity and pain-related disability in response to pain when compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Evidence suggests that disparities between these groups are independent of other demographic factors such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, education, employment, marital status, and other potential confounders, such as medical comorbidities and disease duration. These ethnic differences have been mirrored in the laboratory where controlled, systematic noxious stimuli are applied to healthy individuals. Ethnic differences in laboratory pain responses are well-established, suggesting increased sensitivity to noxious stimulation among AAs compared to NHWs. In our previous work, we have demonstrated enhanced responsiveness in AAs to noxious stimulation on several tasks that indirectly assess endogenous pain-inhibitory systems that are at least partially opioid-mediated. Ethnic differences in endogenous opioid neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system suggest that these systems function less efficiently among AAs and may account for a substantial proportion of the ethnic differences observed in pain and analgesic responses. In addition, pharmacogenetic research shows substantial ethnic group differences in the metabolism, clinical effectiveness, and side-effect profiles of many drugs; including analgesics. The overwhelming majority of clinically used opioids elicit their effects through activation of the mu-opioid receptor, making it an extremely relevant target for investigation. We propose to examine ethnic differences in the supraspinal endogenous opioid system using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mu-opioid receptors employing the mu-selective agonist [11C] carfentanil. Healthy AAs and sex, age, SES matched, NHW participants will undergo one baseline (non-pain) and one capsaicin-induced pain PET session using [11C] carfentanil. The current proposal will measure mu-opioid binding potential and examine its role in ethnic group differences in pain sensitivity. Our overarching objective is to investigate the endogenous opioid system as the mechanism underlying the association between ethnicity and pain sensitivity, thereby enhancing our understanding of the neurobiology of ethnic differences. These findings will have far reaching implications; including elucidating a tangible, physiological mechanism underlying ethnic differences in pain, for prescribing analgesics and advancing personalized medicine. Enhancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying ethnic differences in pain is likely to assist in the refinement of targeted interventios to alleviate clinical pain in at-risk populations, and aid in reducing pain-related health disparites. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain is a major public health problem producing enormous economic costs and profound suffering; considerable evidence demonstrates disparities in the experience of acute and clinical pain, with African Americans experiencing a greater burden of pain when compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The current proposal will measure the endogenous opioid system and examine its role in disparities in pain report. Our goal is to investigate the endogenous opioid system as the mechanism underlying the disparities in pain sensitivity, thereby enhancing our understanding of the neurobiology of ethnic/racial differences in pain, which will assist in the refinement of targeted interventions to alleviate clinical pain i at-risk populations, and aid in reducing pain-related health disparities.",Ethnic

"Virtual Perspective-Taking to Reduce Race and SES Disparities in Pain Care DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed project is to test a novel perspective-taking intervention aimed at reducing racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Previous studies found that Black and low SES patients are less likely to receive guideline-concordant pain care relative to White and high SES patients, respectively. Studies also found that clinicians contribute to these treatment disparities, which directly impact patient outcomes. Few interventions effectively reduce racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Interventions that target clinicians are especially scarce. According to research and theory, enhancing clinician perspective-taking is a promising strategy for improving the care of Black and low SES patients, and this strategy should be pursued during medical training to maximize its effectiveness. Unfortunately, there are numerous limitations and practical constraints to traditional perspective-taking interventions, which reduce their implementation and effectiveness. To overcome these barriers, we developed an innovative methodology that utilizes computer-simulated patients and environments to assess, understand, and remediate pain treatment disparities. In the proposed project, we aim to leverage this approach to test a theoretically-informed, evidence-based intervention to reduce racial and SES disparities in pain treatment. Using computer-simulated patients and environments, our intervention provides real-time feedback to trainees about their pain treatment biases, includes one-on-one interactions with virtual patients with pain, and includes videos of these patients engaging in daily life activities with pain. Our approach allows for the intervention to be individually-tailored to each trainee, thereby enhancing its impact. It also allows for individual trainees to gain exposure to a greater range of racially and socioeconomically diverse patients than can normally be obtained in traditional training settings. Based on previous research and sound theory, we hypothesize that our perspective-taking intervention will increase trainees' knowledge of their own biases, enhance trainees' empathy toward patients, and reduce trainees' anxiety/threat toward patients, and that these changes will be the primary mechanisms underlying reductions in pain treatment disparities. This project represents a critical next step in the nation's goal of reducing racial ad SES disparities and improving pain care. Our intervention could be readily incorporated into medical school and continuing education curricula for widespread dissemination. Our approach could also be leveraged to reduce disparities for other conditions of public health significance, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Given that clinicians are key participants in patient care and are a primary source of health disparities, the proposed project has direct implications for improving care for vulnerable patients. This project will also inform scientific understanding of the mechanisms (e.g., bias awareness, patient empathy, patient anxiety/threat) underlying treatment disparities, as well as medical education to enhance the delivery of equitable, patient-centered care. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project addresses an important societal issue and represents a critical next step in the nation's goal of reducing health disparities and improving pain care.

"Opioid prescribing disparities in a public health crisis: The case of pediatric post-surgical pain management Abstract African Americans adults are less likely to receive analgesics, particularly opioids, even after controlling for pain severity. Research in the pediatric surgical population is more limited but the pattern of disparate use of opioids appear consistent with adult research. While it cannot be assumed that opioids are always the best approach to post-operative pain treatment for children, differential use driven by non-clinical judgments is of concern. This concern, however, exists at a time when opioid addiction is a public health crisis. Although most adolescents who misuse pain medications initially receive them for free from a friend or family member, adolescent access to prescribed opioids has also increased. The relationship between racial disparities in postoperative pain management and opioid addition is complex. Allowing a child's pain to go unaddressed because of concerns driven by bias is unacceptable. On the other hand, overprescribing can enhance risk for addiction or diversion of medications to the illicit market with broad societal implications. Striking the right balance requires empirical evidence that supports data-driven decision-making. This proposal aims to strengthen the evidence base regarding use of opioid pain medications in children following surgical procedures and to explore the inter-related impacts of policy, clinical need, and socio-demographic factors by combining Medicaid claims and electronic health record data with findings from a statewide opioid policy inventory. This research will be done Ohio, a state with the 5th highest opioid mortality in the nation using clinical data from Nationwide Children's Hospital, the nation's largest pediatric surgical provider, performing over 35,000 pediatric surgical procedures each year across 10 pediatric surgical subspecialties and both in-patient and ambulatory surgery centers. We will focus on discharge prescribing of opioids in three high volume pediatric surgical procedures: tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, supracondylar fracture, and appendectomy. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Determine the extent of and trends in racial disparities in postoperative discharge opioid prescribing since the 2011 onset of enhanced opioid prescription reduction activities; and 2) Develop an expanded model, including pain scores and other EMR data, to assess the linkage between differential opioid use for pediatric postoperative pain and opioid use-related outcomes. This analysis will enhance understanding of disparities in opioid use for pain management and support decision making for policy and practice that maximizes equity in pain management while remaining focused on reducing misuse and addiction. Public Health Relevance  African American pediatric surgery patients are less likely to receive an opioid prescription for pain management at discharge than their White counterparts. This disparity exists in the midst of a national opioid epidemic that is driving implementation of use reduction policies that could further expand disparities. This study aims to explore the inter-related impacts of policy, clinical need, and socio-demographic factors on disparities in postoperative discharge opioid prescribing by combining Medicaid claims and electronic medical record data with findings from a statewide opioid policy inventory.",Opioid prescribing disparities in a public health crisis: The case of pediatric post-surgical pain management,9389281,R21MD011767,"['Adenoidectomy ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Outpatient Surgery ', ' Ambulatory Surgery ', ' Ambulatory Surgical Procedures ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain management ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesics ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' Appendectomy ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Heroin ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Epidemic ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' bone fracture ', ' Fracture ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Pediatric Hospitals ', ' Humerus Fracture ', ' Humeral Fractures ', ' Inpatients ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Judgment ', ' Medicaid ', ' mortality ', ' Ohio ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Policy Making ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' Strikes ', ' Time ', ' Tonsillectomy ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Friends ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' Pediatric Surgery ', ' Pediatric Surgical Procedures ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trend ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' addiction ', ' addictive disorder ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' nonmedical use ', ' overdose death ', ' prescription opioid ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' prescription pain reliever ', ' opioid use ', ' implicit bias ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2017,189375,0.35299424811676
"Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PTSD and chronic pain are highly prevalent and each is associated with long-term disability and substance abuse, exacting enormous emotional, functional, and financial tolls on individuals and society. PTSD and chronic pain are frequently co-morbid with overlap between 20% and 70%, representing an enormous public health problem. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which PTSD and chronic pain become intertwined is limited. The majority of studies of the PTSD/chronic pain co-morbidity are cross- sectional, and focused on a single chronic pain condition, limiting causal inferences and generalizability to other chronic pain conditions. Chronic pain is also related to a high prevalence of substance abuse. To understand how trauma-related PTSD, and resilience and vulnerability factors contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse requires prospective designs. Such research is vital among inner-city African American women, who are more likely to experience traumatic stress and pain, but are less likely to be treated appropriately; a phenomenon perhaps leading to greater risk for disability and substance abuse. We propose to examine 3 models related to the development of PTSD/chronic pain pairing and development of substance abuse in people initially presenting with acute pain (not caused by a traumatic event) in a 6-month prospective design. First is the Main Effects Model in which the level of PTSD symptoms at baseline will predict the likelihood of a transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse at 6 months. Second is the Moderation Model in which baseline vulnerability and resilience factors interact with PTSD symptoms to predict the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later. Third is the Mediator Model in which relationships between baseline levels of PTSD symptoms and the development of chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later are mediated by vulnerability and resilience factors at 3 months. Inner-city women (N=600) presenting to an Emergency Department with a complaint of acute bodily pain, ages 18-40 yrs, will be recruited. Only women presenting with acute pelvic/abdominal, neck/shoulder or low back pain, and who do not have a chronic pain history will be enrolled. We will assess trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, pain sensitivity, substance dependence and abuse, acute pain and psychosocial resilience and vulnerability factors across 3 waves (baseline, 3- and 6-months), and obtain additional phone assessment of pain intensity and interference at 1-, 2-, 4-, and 5-months. Inner-city women were chosen because of their high likelihood of exposure to ongoing traumatic events and the opportunity to illuminate a health disparity involving the PTSD/chronic pain pairing among inner-city minority women in particular. The public health problem posed by co-morbid PTSD, chronic pain and substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic pain and developing substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PTSD and chronic pain frequently co-occur with 20-70% of people with chronic pain conditions reporting trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. The public health problem posed by co-occurring PTSD, chronic pain and concomitant substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Results from this prospective study of how PTSD influences the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse will shed light on this well-documented but poorly understood co-morbidity. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions.",Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women,9281712,R01DA039522,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Neck ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Phonation ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Shoulder ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' psychosocial ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain interference ', ' Pain intensity ', ' traumatic event ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' ']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2017,732818,0.334506989553484
"Prospective Study of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Chronic Pain and Pain Burden ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden on racial and ethnic minorities. Substantial inequities exist in the pain treatment received by African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. Data suggest that members of these minority groups are not only more likely to develop chronic pain but also to have this pain accompanied by greater pain burden, i.e., greater suffering, poorer life quality, and worse functional impairment. Only modest headway has been made in understanding why race and ethnicity confer pain inequities and how best to address these disparities. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to contribute to the reduction or outright elimination o racial and ethnic pain disparities. The near-term goal of the planned research is to identify a small set of the most promising intervention targets, from among the plethora of posited explanations, for reducing or eliminating racial/ethnic pain disparities. The planned study would be, to our knowledge, the first ever prospective examination of factors posited to underlie racial and ethnic disparities in the transition from acute to chronic pain. The study would also be the first to investigate these issues in the important context of recovery following serious physical injury requiring hospitalization. For the proposed research, a sample of 900 adult survivors of serious physical injury, comprised of roughly equal proportions of African-Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Whites, will be recruited during hospitalization from large trauma centers in Los Angeles, CA and Philadelphia, PA. Interviews will be conducted during hospitalization and at 3-, and 12-month follow-up. Medical records will provide information on injury severity and medication use in-hospital which may influence the course of pain. The specific aims are (1) to determine whether African-American and Latino physical injury survivors experience more severe pain following injury relative to their non-Latino White counterparts; (2) to determine whether African-American and Latino injury survivors experience greater pain burden relative to their non- Latino White counterparts; (3) to determine whether African-American and Latino differences in pain severity or pain burden can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for interventions aimed at reduction or elimination of pain outcome disparities; and (4) To determine whether pain outcomes in at-risk minority groups can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for group-tailored interventions to reduce pain severity and pain burden irrespective of whether these candidates contribute to between-group pain disparities. The knowledge gained from the proposed research has high potential to accelerate efforts aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic pain disparities by identifying promising targets for prevention and intervention efforts to close the pain gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden for African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts.

"iCanCope with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary Pain related to sickle cell disease (SCD) is most often treated in the home by patients and families, but this management is typically suboptimal. SCD mostly affects people of African descent. This population is known to suffer many racial and cultural inequities related to the medical management of SCD pain. Cognitive- behavioral therapies (CBT) that promote pain self-management can lead to symptom reduction, improved quality of life, and decreased healthcare use. However, most people with SCD do not receive CBT-based treatment due to barriers such as poor accessibility, limited availability of professionals, and high costs. Youth with SCD must assume more responsibility for managing their SCD pain, which typically becomes more chronic in adulthood. However, many youth never develop these important self-management skills during childhood and are poorly prepared to cope with SCD pain as adults. There is a critical need for innovative pain self-management programs that are accessible and tailored for youth with SCD pain. Access to web and mobile technologies among African Americans is high. In a qualitative study conducted by our group, youth with SCD, parents, and healthcare professionals indicated that these technologies could be applied to meet their pain self-management needs. Based on our team experiences in developing and testing web- and mobile- based pain management programs in other populations, we hypothesize that this approach will also be effective for delivering pain self-management to youth with SCD. In this application, our goal is to improve pain self-management and functioning in youth (aged 12-18) with SCD by developing and testing a tailored web and smartphone-based application (iCanCope with SCD). First, we plan to apply a user-centered design approach to refine and beta test the program. The program will include: (I) goal setting, (II) peer-based social support, and (III) pain self-management training. Second, we will determine program feasibility and initial program effectiveness through a pilot three-site randomized controlled trial. Preliminary effectiveness will be determined in 160 youth randomized to treatment compared to attention control. We hypothesize that youth who receive iCanCope with SCD will achieve greater reduction in pain intensity, pain-related disability and increased adaptive coping strategies (primary outcomes) as well as significant improvement in physical and emotional functioning and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up compared to youth who receive the attention-control condition. Third, we will explore moderators and mediators of treatment effect. This project represents a significant advance in delivering tailored psychological therapies for youth with SCD. Our long-term goal is to develop effective and flexible treatments that can be delivered at low cost to reduce SCD pain and disability, and better equip youth to cope with SCD as adults. Project Narrative Smartphone and Internet technologies can be leveraged to deliver engaging and flexible pain self- management therapies to adolescents with sickle cell disease and their caregivers. Our long-term goal is to develop effective and scalable treatments that can be delivered at low cost to reduce pain and disability, and better equip adolescents with strategies to cope with their sickle cell disease pain as adults.",iCanCope with Sickle Cell Disease,9543534,R01HD086978,"['Health system ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Characteristics ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cost ', ' family management ', ' health related quality of life ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' treatment effect ', ' user centered design ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' intervention effect ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' Pain intensity ', ' attentional control ', ' Pediatric Hematologist ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' symptom relief ', ' symptom reduction ', ' symptom alleviation ', ' relieves symptoms ', ' fewer symptoms ', ' decrease symptom ', ' ameliorating symptom ', ' alleviate symptom ', ' reduce symptoms ', ' service gap ', ' self-management program ', ' pain self-management ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Canada ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Parents ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Program Accessibility ', ' Program Effectiveness ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Development ', ' Social Perception ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Gender ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Mediating ', ' Self Management ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare service use ', ' health care service use ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' African ', ' satisfaction ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' psychosocial ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' skills training ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' skills ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' smartphone ', ' smart phone ', ' iPhone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' ']",NICHD,SEATTLE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2018,459188,0.4046716061610317

"Key Molecular Mechanisms of Chronic Pain Vulnerability in Women Experiencing MVC Abstract Exposure to traumatic events is common in life. In industrialized nations, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are one of the most common types of trauma, with over 50 million MVCs occurring worldwide each year. The great majority of individuals experiencing MVC do not have serious injury; in the US more than 90% of individuals seen in the emergency department after MVC are discharged home after evaluation. However, a substantial proportion of such individuals develop chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSP).  Most individuals who develop chronic MSP following MVC are women. This fact is consistent with the marked increase in MSP burden experienced by women vs. men in other settings. Biopsychosocial mechanisms responsible for this increased vulnerability remain poorly understood, leading the NIH and eminent pain scientists to call for more research aimed at addressing this knowledge gap.  The candidate, Dr. Sarah Linnstaedt, is an RNA biologist who seeks a K01 career development award to gain the training necessary to perform studies that will provide important new insights into the biologic mechanisms, and the interactions between these mechanisms and cognitive/psychosocial factors, that contribute to chronic MSP pathogenesis in women. Specifically, the proposed career development award will provide Dr. Linnstaedt with the knowledge and skills necessary to (1) evaluate candidate biological mechanisms within contemporary, state-of-the-art biopsychsocial models of chronic MSP that include influential cognitive and psychosocial factors, (2) perform studies of sex-specific biological mechanisms that previous data, and the candidate’s pilot data, suggest contribute to chronic MSP in women, and (3) evaluate potential interactions between biological and psychosocial factors. Data for this work will be drawn from biologic samples collected as part of a mentor’s longitudinal cohort study of chronic MSP pathogensis after MVC. By the end of the award period, Dr. Linnstaedt will have the necessary knowledge, experience, skills, and data to obtain an R01 and become an independently-funded translational research scientist whose work addresses the current marked disparity in chronic pain incidence among women. Project Narrative Little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms leading to increased chronic pain in women. The candidate's first-in-kind studies will use biological samples and cognitive/psychosocial data from a longitudinal cohort of individuals enrolled following motor vehicle collision trauma to evaluate candidate mediators of pain pathogenesis in women. Such work has the potential to lead to new strategies that lower pain incidence and severity in women and all individuals.",Key Molecular Mechanisms of Chronic Pain Vulnerability in Women Experiencing MVC,9453470,K01AR071504,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biological Factors ', ' Biologic Factor ', ' Cells ', ' Cell Body ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Estradiol ', ' Therapeutic Estradiol ', ' Progynon ', ' Ovocylin ', ' Ovocyclin ', ' Estraldine ', ' Estradiol-17beta ', ' Estradiol-17 beta ', ' Estrace ', ' Diogynets ', ' Diogyn ', ' Dimenformon ', ' Aquadiol ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Gene Expression Regulation ', ' Gene Regulation Process ', ' Gene Regulation ', ' Gene Action Regulation ', ' Genes ', ' Incidence ', ' Influentials ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Mentors ', ' Methylation ', ' Musculoskeletal Pain ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Play ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Estrogen Receptors ', ' Research ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Gonadal Steroid Hormones ', ' sex steroid ', ' gonadal steroids ', ' Sex Steroid Hormones ', ' Sex Hormones ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' X Chromosome ', ' X Inactivation ', ' X-Chromosome Inactivation ', ' Lyonization ', ' Mediating ', ' promoter ', ' promotor ', ' chronic pain ', ' Injury ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Industrialized Nations ', ' Industrialized Countries ', ' Developed Nations ', ' Developed Countries ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' psychosocial ', ' Equation ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Untranslated RNA ', ' noncoding ', ' Nontranslated RNA ', ' Noncoding RNA ', ' Non-Coding RNA ', ' Non-Coding ', ' Functional RNA ', ' MicroRNAs ', ' miRNAs ', ' miRNA ', ' Micro RNA ', ' Pathogenicity ', ' Binding ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Molecular ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Trauma ', ' Vehicular crash ', ' Vehicular collision ', ' Motor vehicle crash ', ' Motor vehicle collision ', ' Car crash ', ' Car collision ', ' Automobile crash ', ' Automobile collision ', ' Vehicle crash ', ' clinical effect ', ' traumatic event ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' pain outcome ', ' chronic MSK pain ', ' chronic musculoskeletal pain ', ' ']",NIAMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K01,2018,125588,0.2989885454265379
"Acceptance and commitment therapy to address the psychosocial co-morbidities of chronic pain in aging people living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic pain affects a very high proportion of aging people living with HIV (aPLWH) and is thought to be related to both direct toxicity of HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) and by psychosocial factors that negatively affect pain (i.e. loneliness, HIV stigma). PLWH are also at increased risk for prescription opiate misuse. However as PLWH age, non-opiate medications used for pain can contribute to other negative outcomes such as falls, altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding. Thus there is a critical need for the development of novel interventions in the management of chronic pain in aPLWH that consider the psychological co- morbidities of aging with HIV and that can minimize the need for prescription medications. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has previously been evaluated in older persons with chronic pain and has demonstrated higher levels of satisfaction and efficacy when compared to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). ACT has never been evaluated in aPLWH for chronic pain, but has theoretical advantages over CBT for this population. Specifically several negatively modifying factors of CBT efficacy such as cognitive deficits are common in aPLWH. The overarching objective of this study is to determine the acceptability and feasibility of an ACT intervention for the management of chronic pain adapted to aPLWH. To accomplish this objective I will 1) train lay personnel to perform ACT to determine feasibility of this approach for future implementation, 2) conduct uncontrolled group ACT in aPLWH to generate participant feedback and questionnaire data to inform ACT adaption with the assistance of a steering commitee, and 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the acceptability of adapted ACT compared to pain education. At completion of this grant we expect to have successfully trained lay personnel to perform group ACT, adapted ACT from quantitative and qualitative data collected from an uncontrolled study of group ACT, and determined whether ACT is acceptable and feasible as an intervention in aPLWH. These expected outcomes may benefit other aging populations with chronic pain that are enriched for psychosocial co-morbidities such as persons who inject drugs, the socioeconomically disadvantaged, and racial or gender minorities. This proposal is aligned with the Office of AIDS Research High Priorities to better understand “HIV-associated comorbidities” which includes pain and to “Reduce Health Disparities in treatment outcomes of those living with HIV/AIDS” and with the National Pain Strategy to “expand investment … in the development of safe and effective pain treatments.” PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic pain impacts a large proportion of aging people living with HIV (aPLWH) and involves factors directly related to HIV (neurotoxicity) and psychosocial co-morbidities common in aPLWH (i.e. social isolation and loneliness). Novel interventions that acknowledge these psychosocial co-morbidities may improve the efficacy of chronic pain management and minimize the use of potentially dangerous medications. This grant proposes to adapt and pilot a pain psychotherapy approach using group acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in aPLWH with chronic pain.",Acceptance and commitment therapy to address the

The long-term objective of the proposed research is to contribute to the reduction or outright elimination o racial and ethnic pain disparities. The near-term goal of the planned research is to identify a small set of the most promising intervention targets, from among the plethora of posited explanations, for reducing or eliminating racial/ethnic pain disparities. The planned study would be, to our knowledge, the first ever prospective examination of factors posited to underlie racial and ethnic disparities in the transition from acute to chronic pain. The study would also be the first to investigate these issues in the important context of recovery following serious physical injury requiring hospitalization. For the proposed research, a sample of 900 adult survivors of serious physical injury, comprised of roughly equal proportions of African-Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Whites, will be recruited during hospitalization from large trauma centers in Los Angeles, CA and Philadelphia, PA. Interviews will be conducted during hospitalization and at 3-, and 12-month follow-up. Medical records will provide information on injury severity and medication use in-hospital which may influence the course of pain. The specific aims are (1) to determine whether African-American and Latino physical injury survivors experience more severe pain following injury relative to their non-Latino White counterparts; (2) to determine whether African-American and Latino injury survivors experience greater pain burden relative to their non- Latino White counterparts; (3) to determine whether African-American and Latino differences in pain severity or pain burden can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for interventions aimed at reduction or elimination of pain outcome disparities; and (4) To determine whether pain outcomes in at-risk minority groups can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for group-tailored interventions to reduce pain severity and pain burden irrespective of whether these candidates contribute to between-group pain disparities. The knowledge gained from the proposed research has high potential to accelerate efforts aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic pain disparities by identifying promising targets for prevention and intervention efforts to close the pain gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden for African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. The proposed prospective investigation will study African-American, Latino, and non-Latino White physical injury survivors from initial hospitalization for a period of one year to identify promising intervention targets to reduce or eliminate racial/ethnic pain disparities.",Prospective Study of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Chronic Pain and Pain Burden,9706434,R01MD010372,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medical Records ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' trauma centers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Latino ', ' chronic pain ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' Sampling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' pain outcome ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2018,100000,0.4157326854888374

"University of Florida Resource Center for Minority Aging Research PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain conditions represent arguably the most prevalent and costly public health problem in the United States, and they are the leading cause of disability worldwide. While pain affects individuals throughout the lifespan, older adults are disproportionately impacted and are at particularly increased risk for chronic pain and pain-related disability. Surprisingly, knowledge regarding the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying age- related increases in pain remains quite limited, therefore, increased research is needed to elucidate social and behavioral contributions to pain and disability among older adults. A critical barrier to progress in this area of research is the limited availability of investigators with appropriate interdisciplinary training in addressing later life pain and disability. With strong institutional support, the University of Florida (UF) Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) will be established to address these scientific and workforce development needs. The UF RCMAR has an educational objective to provide outstanding training and career development opportunities to promising investigators from underrepresented backgrounds. The UF RCMAR's research objective is to conduct innovative and impactful transdisciplinary social and behavioral research addressing pain and disability among older adults, including health disparities in later life pain and disability (e.g. racial and ethnic differences, sex and gender differences, and socioeconomic influences). The UF RCMAR will accomplish these objectives through the synergistic efforts of four Cores: an Administrative Core (AC), a Research Education Component (REC), an Analysis Core (AnC), and a Community Liaison and Recruitment Core (CLRC). In addition, the UF RCMAR will benefit from extensive collaborations with other UF entities, including The UF Pain Research & Intervention Center of Excellence (PRICE), the UF Institute on Aging (IOA), and the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The UF RCMAR boasts an outstanding interdisciplinary group of Core Faculty with expertise spanning the spectrum of clinical and translational research related to our theme of biopsychosocial contributions to pain and disability among older adults. In order to accomplish its objectives, the UF RCMAR will recruit and retain outstanding early stage investigators from unrepresented backgrounds and provide them with excellent mentoring and career development support. Through its research activities, the UF RCMAR will produce novel and important information regarding social and behavioral contributors to pain and disability in older adults, and will develop and test innovative interventions to reduce later life pain and disability.

"Cooperative Pain Education and Self-management: Expanding Treatment for Real-world Access (COPES ExTRA) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) is an evidence-based psychological intervention that is effective for reducing pain and improving function for patients with chronic pain. Numerous barriers exist to face-to-face delivery of this treatment, including patient travel limitations, the need for frequent in-person sessions, and the scarcity of trained therapists. Leveraging technology-based interventions, like interactive voice response (IVR), which allow patients to engage in treatment from their home, may improve access to CBT-CP. The overall goal of this project is to conduct a pragmatic trial to examine the real world effectiveness of an IVR-based form of CBT-CP called COoperative Pain Education and Self-management (COPES). In the spirit of pragmatic trials, our approach will minimize clinic disruption and avoid adding research staff in the field by using the VHA’s electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate recruitment and to collect data, all while delivering COPES from a centralized VA location. In preparation for the pragmatic trial, the initial study phase (UG3) will: a) identify facilities to participate in the trial from among the 60 Women’s Health Practice Based Network (WH-PBRN) sites, b) examine the adequacy of the EHR for providing outcome data, c) determine the feasibility of using EHR provider alerts to promote recruitment and d) secure all regulatory approvals along with support from leadership at selected sites. Phase two (UH3) will then compare outcomes among Veterans randomized to either: 1) COPES, a 10-week IVR-based CBT and walking program plus any provider prescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain treatments (COPES+UC), or 2) in-person CBT-CP provided by clinicians, previously trained through VHA’s evidence based psychotherapy program plus any provider prescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (VHA CBT-CP+UC). Patients will be compared on a composite measure of pain intensity and functioning, EHR pain intensity, and health care use including emergency department, urgent care, and specialty pain services along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain interventions. Uptake and variation in outcomes across groups will also be evaluated where treatment disparities are possible (e.g. by sex, race, mental health comorbidities). Additionally, the cost of the COPES intervention will be examined, including intervention delivery expenditures and budget impact analysis. Finally, evaluation of the intervention process will be informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). CFIR-guided interviews with study site clinicians and administrators will assess experiences with the COPES and CBT-CP interventions and implementation findings will be communicated with participating sites and stakeholders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) is an evidence-based intervention that is effective in reducing pain and improving function for Veterans with chronic pain, yet numerous barriers exist to widespread implementation of traditional CBT-CP, including patient travel limitations, the need for frequent in-person sessions, and the scarcity of trained therapists. Because technology-based interventions, like interactive voice response (IVR), allow patients to engage in treatment from their home, they may improve access to CBT-CP.

"Identifying Opportunities to Improve Hydroxyurea Therapy Initiation and Adherence among Children with Sickle Cell Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY Approximately 1 in 500 African American births are diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD), which is associated with substantial morbidity and risk of early mortality. Among affected individuals, sickling of the red blood cells causes excruciating, chronic pain, which is the most common symptom of SCD. The presence of pain indicates suboptimal disease management and results in substantial financial burden on the healthcare system. Over 50% of children with SCD have at least one pain crisis a year; these pain crises are associated with substantially lower quality of life, as well as inadequate sleep, more school absences, chronic depression, and impaired peer relationships. The frequency, intensity, and duration of pain crises can only be controlled through appropriate disease management using the medication hydroxyurea. Use of hydroxyurea therapy by children with SCD is associated with lower rates of initial and recurrent episodes of pain, hand-foot syndrome (dactylitis), acute chest syndrome, and hospitalization compared with no hydroxyurea therapy. Given the substantial potential of hydroxyurea therapy to reduce pain crises and other clinical complications among children with SCD, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released (2014) recommendations for its use among children. All children (9 months or older) with specific subtypes of SCD should be offered hydroxyurea therapy to reduce its health-related complications, irrespective of disease severity. The existing body of evidence regarding the use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD is based on studies conducted prior to the NHLBI recommendation for use among all children. Consequently, there is a complete gap in knowledge regarding use of hydroxyurea therapy post NHLBI recommendations. Using administrative claims from states with the highest prevalence of SCD, complemented by focus groups with key stakeholders, this research project will identify multiple levels of opportunities for improvement in appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD. In addition, this project provides the framework to enable me to become a successful independent investigator and a leader in reducing health disparities among children with severe chronic conditions through development of expertise in comparative effectiveness, qualitative methods, and medication adherence theory. Combined, these research and training activities will provide a crucial foundation for a subsequent application to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to gauge the effectiveness of interventions targeted at SCD patients, their caregivers, and providers of SCD services to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among this vulnerable population. To this end, the following aims will be investigated: Research Aim 1: Quantify hydroxyurea therapy prevalence prior to NHLBI guidelines, and changes in prevalence post-NHLBI guidelines among children with SCD using Medicaid administrative claims data, as well as predictors of hydroxyurea initiation and adherence.  Specific Aim 1a: Assess baseline hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD prior to NHLBI guidelines (2005-2012). Specific Aim 1b: Evaluate changes in hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD post- NHLBI guidelines (2011-2017). Specific Aim 1c: Identify characteristics associated with hydroxyurea initiation and subsequent adherence among children with SCD. Research Aim 2: Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of hydroxyurea therapy among adherent users on reducing the incidence of pain crises, adverse outcomes, and use of health services, compared with those having limited or no use of hydroxyurea therapy. Research Aim 3: Identify barriers to initiation and adherence of hydroxyurea therapy through focus groups conducted among adolescents with SCD, caregivers of children with SCD, and SCD health services providers in Michigan. Overall Career Development Aim: To acquire the skills and experience necessary to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy in children with SCD. These aims will be achieved during 3 phases of research over 5 years under the guidance of a multi- disciplinary team of experienced mentors. Through the conduct of high quality research, formal coursework, and interaction with mentors, this K01 award will provide the PI with the necessary training to become a successful independent investigator and to develop a future R01 grant application. If successful, this line of inquiry will improve health outcomes and quality of life among children with SCD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Severe pain episodes are the most common, debilitating, and costly morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Use of hydroxyurea is the only method to prevent these pain crises among children, and interventions to increase its use are urgently needed.

"Identifying Pain Trajectories In Sickle Cell Disease Using Latent Class Analysis PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of heritable red blood cell disorders that primarily affect individuals who identify as Black or African-American. Other affected groups include those of Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, and Asian Indian descent. The hallmark of SCD is the painful vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), which is still not well understood or managed. This may result in delays in treatment, undertreatment, and unnecessary suffering. Because SCD primarily affects African-Americans and other minority groups, mistrust between patients and providers may put patients with SCD at increased risk of healthcare disparities, including reduced access to necessary pain management. For most patients, pain is managed at home, further contributing to underestimation by healthcare practitioners of the prevalence and impact of SCD pain. However, when patients in VOC present acutely, they have usually exhausted home care and outpatient therapies, thereby signaling the need for parenteral opioids. Using a retrospective cohort of 150 patients with SCD hospitalized at one urban academic medical center, the overall goal of this study is to develop methodology to characterize the sickle cell pain trajectory. Specifically, the aims are to (1) use latent class analysis to identify different patterns of pain trajectories during hospitalizations for sickle cell pain crisis and determine socio-demographic and clinical factors associated with the different pain trajectories; (2) describe the relationship between treatment management strategies and sickle cell pain scores during hospitalization; and (3) assess the relationship between different patterns of sickle cell pain trajectories and future readmission for sickle cell pain crisis. Results from the proposed study can then be used to develop prospective studies to better measure pain during hospitalizations or to identify factors that affect the pain trajectory, which can be used to target interventions or pain management approaches. In addition, better characterization of the pain trajectory and treatment of pain in SCD are especially urgent as efforts are made nationally to restrict access to opioids given the current crisis of abuse, addiction, and overdose. Patients experiencing severe and devastating pain, such as those with SCD, should not be made to suffer because they are denied necessary treatment.

"Psychological and brain mechanisms underlying disparities in opioid and non-opioid pain treatment decisions Project Summary Unequal prescribing of opioid and non-opioid analgesics among demographic groups contributes to two major health disparities in the United States. Overprescribing of opioid analgesics to treat both acute and chronic nonmalignant pain, especially in non-Hispanic whites, has fueled the opioid abuse epidemic. Underprescribing of opioid and non-opioid analgesics in minorities and women, even when their use is medically indicated (e.g., acute and cancer pain), reduces the effectiveness of pain management in these groups. In order to mitigate analgesic prescribing disparities and the associated risks of opioid abuse and poor pain management, we must understand the mechanisms underlying these disparities. The current project will test two potential contributors to these pain treatment disparities: 1) clinicians' inaccurate demographic stereotypes about pain sensitivity and tendency to abuse opioids (i.e., the stereotype hypothesis), and 2) reduced activation of clinicians' pain-related neural systems (e.g., anterior cingulate and anterior insula) in response to the pain of demographic outgroup patients (i.e., the vicarious pain hypothesis). Prior studies of mechanisms underlying analgesic prescribing disparities have been limited by the use of experimental paradigms that were low in ecological validity e.g. asking participants to make prescribing decisions based solely on text-based medical vignettes or depictions of individuals feigning pain. Additionally, although the robust fMRI literature on vicarious pain biases is related to biases in pain assessment, vicarious pain biases have not been tested as a potential contributor to biases pain treatment decisions. In the present proposal, these methodological limitations will be addressed and the stereotype and vicarious pain hypotheses will be tested through 3 specific aims. Aim 1 involves the design and production of a more ecologically valid video-based simulated pain assessment and treatment paradigm depicting individuals experiencing genuine pain. Aim 2 includes an fMRI study of the effects of clinicians' (medical students') vicarious pain responses and pain stereotypes on demographic biases in simulated pain assessment and analgesic prescribing, using the video paradigm created in Aim 1. Finally, to determine the clinical applicability of the findings from Aim 2, Aim 3 includes face-to-face pain assessments and treatment recommendations during simulated clinical interactions with standardized patient actors. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, these studies will yield new understanding of the relative contributions of pain-related stereotypes and vicarious pain to analgesic prescribing disparities. These results could indicate whether pain stereotype education, efforts to increase pain empathy, or both should be incorporated into clinician interventions aimed at reducing analgesic prescribing disparities. Through this K01 career development award, the candidate will gain facility in three areas not included in her past training: clinical pain assessment and treatment, multivariate statistical analysis, and behavioral medicine in order to more effectively understand psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms underlying health disparities in pain and pain management. Project Narrative The need for effective interventions to reduce overprescribing of opioids grows more urgent as the number of individuals affected by the opioid crisis continues to rise, and the need to improve pain management in minority populations becomes more critical as minority populations in the U.S. grow. The proposed research uses a novel combination of neurobiological (fMRI) and behavioral measures to investigate mechanisms underlying clinicians' gender and ethnic biases in opioid and non-opioid analgesic pain treatment decisions. The findings of this research can inform improvements in clinician training aimed as mitigating analgesic prescribing disparities and the associated risks of opioid abuse and poor pain management.",Psychological and brain mechanisms underlying disparities in opioid and non-opioid pain treatment decisions,9502736,K01DA045735,"['Affect ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cues ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Face Pain ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Standardization ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Medical Students ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' nonopioid ', ' nonopiate analgesic ', ' non-opiate analgesic ', ' non-narcotic analgesic ', ' Nonopioid Analgesics ', ' Nonnarcotic Analgesics ', ' non-opioid analgesic ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Text ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' opioid medication ', ' opiate medication ', ' licit opioid ', ' prescription opioid ', ' Pain intensity ', ' University resources ', ' ethnic bias ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' patient screening ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' clinical pain ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,K01,2018,175010,0.49555743622115656
"Estradiol and Zoster Associated Orofacial Pain ABSTRACT People with herpes zoster (HZ) or “shingles” can suffer from orofacial pain. Orofacial HZ is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the trigeminal ganglia. Importantly, women report HZ pain three times more often than men, but the mechanism for this sex disparity is unknown. A screen by our lab of over 20,000 genes in five different regions of the orofacial pain pathway revealed that the greatest change in gene expression occurred in the thalamus, such that glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) were elevated at proestrus (high 17 β-estradiol, E2) but not diestrus (low E2). In preliminary studies we showed that female rats have a greater VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response in comparison to males; mirroring the human sex difference. We also showed that reducing E2 production in male and female rats increases their nociceptive response and lastly, knock-down of VGAT expression in the thalamus increased the nociceptive response. Based on these studies we hypothesized that E2 attenuates orofacial nociception by increasing GAD2 or VGAT, enhancing GABAergic neural inhibition within the thalamus to reduce pain. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will characterize thalamic control of the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. The working hypothesis for Aim 1 is that GABA interneurons inhibit neurons in the thalamus to reduce VZV induced nociception. To test this hypothesis first, VZV induced nociception and neuronal activity will be recorded after attenuating inhibitory interneurons. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be determined after modulating GAD2 and VGAT expression in these interneurons. Aim 2 will determine the role of sex steroids in modulating the VZV induced nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 will increase expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus causing attenuation of neuronal activity and the nociceptive response. To test this hypothesis first, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be measured in female and male rats after administering E2 or reducing E2 production. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be measured after knock-down of GAD2 and VGAT expression in rats with varied E2 levels. Aim 3 will characterize the mechanism by which sex steroids modulate VGAT and GAD2 to affect the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 binds to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) causing increased expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus resulting in attenuation of nociception. To test this idea, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be quantitated in rats after mutating ERα promoter sites using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. From these three aims we expect to determine 1) that GABA interneurons inhibit thalamic signaling to reduce orofacial pain, 2) that GAD2 and VGAT increases in these neurons through an ERα dependent mechanism, and 3) that GAD2 and VGAT are responsible, in part, for the sex difference observed in HZ pain. Identifying a mechanism by which E2 affects HZ-associated pain will provide new targets for treating people suffering from this chronic disorder. Project Narrative These studies will evaluate the role of two neuron inhibitory genes, glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). Thalamic expression of these two genes was regulated by estrogen and the role of these genes in the underlying molecular pathogenesis of Zoster associated nociception will be evaluated in this application. These experiments will provide valuable insights into an area of Herpes Zoster pain biology and pathology that are poorly understood and highly prioritized by the NIDCR. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel genes by which 17β-estradiol affects orofacial hypersensitivity will be identified, providing a greater understanding of why females suffer greater pain and allow for

"Using Technology to Deliver Evidence-Based Interventions for Pain to Patients with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this candidate's program of research is to improve behavioral and physical health and reduce health disparities by using multimedia technology to deliver evidence-based interventions to underserved populations. The focus is sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition that disproportionately affects those of African descent. Many people living with SCD suffer from daily chronic pain as well as recurrent acute pain episodes that require medical attention. Opioid medication is the primary treatment for pain in SCD, despite its limited effectiveness and negative side-effects. The proposed K23 attempts to address the need for an alternative, non-pharmacological pain treatment in SCD. Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) has been found effective for reducing chronic pain and may be a low cost, easily accessible and scalable pain treatment in SCD. The candidate's K12 project tested a cCBT program for anxiety and depression; preliminary results suggest that patients liked using the program, but found that much of its content did not relate to their lives. To address this limitation, the proposed K23 project will adapt an existing cCBT program for pain management to create ReThink Pain SCD, a culturally-tailored, mobile-phone delivered behavioral intervention designed specifically to help African American patients self-manage chronic sickle cell pain. Aim 1: Modify and tailor the generic cCBT pain program, using qualitative research methods to understand the needs and barriers to pain management in patients with SCD, as well as the opportunities to engage this population using multimedia. These data will inform the development of the features and content of ReThink Pain SCD. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot pragmatic clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing this pain intervention into routine SCD care. Forty patients with SCD will be randomized to either receive 8 sessions of the cCBT program or 8 online education modules on a smartphone. Primary outcomes of the trial include feasibility (recruitment, retention, provider and patient feedback) and acceptability (sessions completed) of the ReThink Pain SCD program. In order to achieve the goals of this research plan and transition to independence, the candidate requires further training in user-centered design, implementation science, design and conduct of pragmatic clinical trials, and team management and leadership. This proposal includes an exceptional team of mentors and consultants. Primary mentor Dr. Bruce Rollman is founding Director of the Center for Behavioral Health and Smart Technology. Co-mentor Dr. Robert Noll is a clinical psychologist with expertise in behavioral intervention trials. Co-mentor Dr. Laura De Castro is a nationally recognized trialist and expert in sickle cell disease. This training and research plan will form the basis for a future multicenter clinical trial testing the efficacy of ReThink Pain SCD for improving pain outcomes among adults with SCD, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K23 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to determine whether a tailored behavioral intervention delivered over mobile phones can be an effective therapy for chronic pain in a predominately African American patient population, specifically patients living with sickle cell disease. Ultimately, this research will inform the delivery of evidence-based pain treatment in racial and ethnic minorities living with chronic pain.",Using Technology to Deliver Evidence-Based Interventions

"Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PTSD and chronic pain are highly prevalent and each is associated with long-term disability and substance abuse, exacting enormous emotional, functional, and financial tolls on individuals and society. PTSD and chronic pain are frequently co-morbid with overlap between 20% and 70%, representing an enormous public health problem. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which PTSD and chronic pain become intertwined is limited. The majority of studies of the PTSD/chronic pain co-morbidity are cross- sectional, and focused on a single chronic pain condition, limiting causal inferences and generalizability to other chronic pain conditions. Chronic pain is also related to a high prevalence of substance abuse. To understand how trauma-related PTSD, and resilience and vulnerability factors contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse requires prospective designs. Such research is vital among inner-city African American women, who are more likely to experience traumatic stress and pain, but are less likely to be treated appropriately; a phenomenon perhaps leading to greater risk for disability and substance abuse. We propose to examine 3 models related to the development of PTSD/chronic pain pairing and development of substance abuse in people initially presenting with acute pain (not caused by a traumatic event) in a 6-month prospective design. First is the Main Effects Model in which the level of PTSD symptoms at baseline will predict the likelihood of a transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse at 6 months. Second is the Moderation Model in which baseline vulnerability and resilience factors interact with PTSD symptoms to predict the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later. Third is the Mediator Model in which relationships between baseline levels of PTSD symptoms and the development of chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later are mediated by vulnerability and resilience factors at 3 months. Inner-city women (N=600) presenting to an Emergency Department with a complaint of acute bodily pain, ages 18-40 yrs, will be recruited. Only women presenting with acute pelvic/abdominal, neck/shoulder or low back pain, and who do not have a chronic pain history will be enrolled. We will assess trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, pain sensitivity, substance dependence and abuse, acute pain and psychosocial resilience and vulnerability factors across 3 waves (baseline, 3- and 6-months), and obtain additional phone assessment of pain intensity and interference at 1-, 2-, 4-, and 5-months. Inner-city women were chosen because of their high likelihood of exposure to ongoing traumatic events and the opportunity to illuminate a health disparity involving the PTSD/chronic pain pairing among inner-city minority women in particular. The public health problem posed by co-morbid PTSD, chronic pain and substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic pain and developing substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PTSD and chronic pain frequently co-occur with 20-70% of people with chronic pain conditions reporting trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. The public health problem posed by co-occurring PTSD, chronic pain and concomitant substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Results from this prospective study of how PTSD influences the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse will shed light on this well-documented but poorly understood co-morbidity. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions.",Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women,9490306,R01DA039522,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Neck ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Shoulder ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' chronic pain ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' psychosocial ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain interference ', ' Pain intensity ', ' traumatic event ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' recruit ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' ']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,577457,0.334506989553484
"Evidence-based Approaches to Chronic Pain Management in Youth with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain is a complex and challenging problem associated with significant disability and suffering among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). There is a gap in scientific knowledge in understanding the progression of chronic SCD pain that hinders the development of effective therapeutic options. Psychological treatments are key components of comprehensive chronic pain management, but currently have limited efficacy for managing SCD pain in youth. Thus, the long-term career goal of this candidate is to become an independent clinical investigator with expertise in SCD pain to establish a novel stepped care model of delivering behavioral interventions for SCD pain management that are easily implemented in real-world clinical settings. She will begin to achieve these goals by obtaining clinical and research training in SCD pain physiology and pharmacology and training in implementation science, health disparities research, and advanced quantitative and qualitative methods to support a patient-centered approach to pain intervention development, optimization, and evaluation. Her career development plan is uniquely tailored to fulfill gaps in her training in pediatric pain under the mentorship of national and international leaders at Emory University and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. The training plan leverages the well- supported infrastructure of the largest pediatric sickle cell program in the US as well as national and institutional opportunities to ensure didactic, experiential, and specialized individual instruction. The research objectives of this application are to first rigorously characterize trajectories of chronic pain over a 24-month period in a cohort of youth with SCD (ages 10-18 years). Data will help identify modifiable psychosocial and family risk factors (e.g., elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms, caregiver stress) that predict different chronic pain trajectories to inform relevant behavioral treatment targets in a family-focused cognitive-behavioral intervention. Standard qualitative and mixed-method approaches and iterative design using focus groups, key informant interviews, and community stakeholders will be used to develop and refine intervention content and format and solicit feedback to enhance the success of future implementation in clinical settings. The result will be a family-focused, culturally informed, evidence-based intervention termed Back2Living (“Building Adaptive Coping and Knowledge To improve daily Living”) that is amenable for implementation in real-world clinical settings. A pilot proof-of-concept trial will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Back2Living with youth with chronic SCD pain and their parents. An adaptive treatment approach with 4-8 treatment sessions selected on the basis of baseline assessment will target comorbid psychosocial risk factors and allow flexibility in tailoring treatment components to meet individual family needs to reduce pain interference, pain, and healthcare use. Results of this proposal may ultimately contribute to novel comprehensive treatment approaches to treat chronic pain in pediatric SCD and improve quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although chronic pain is a significant problem that contributes to poor quality of life in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about the individual and family psychosocial factors that contribute to chronic SCD pain, which severely hinders the development of effective treatment options. This research will characterize the natural course of chronic SCD pain and determine psychosocial risk factors that impact chronic pain in youth with SCD to inform the development of an adaptive family-focused behavioral intervention that is tailored to meet individual family needs to reduce pain-related disability. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a psychosocial risk stratification to inform comprehensive treatment approaches for SCD pain management and prevention.",Evidence-based Approaches to

"Ethnic differences in endogenous pain regulation: PET imaging of opioid receptors DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain is the number one motivator for healthcare utilization, affects over 100 million Americans, costs in excess of one trillion dollars annually and exacts profound suffering and physical disability. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that ethnic groups show substantial variability in the experience of acute and clinical pain, with African Americans (AAs) having increased prevalence of a number of clinical pain conditions and reporting higher levels of pain severity and pain-related disability in response to pain when compared to non-Hispanic whites (NHW). Evidence suggests that disparities between these groups are independent of other demographic factors such as age, sex, socioeconomic status, education, employment, marital status, and other potential confounders, such as medical comorbidities and disease duration. These ethnic differences have been mirrored in the laboratory where controlled, systematic noxious stimuli are applied to healthy individuals. Ethnic differences in laboratory pain responses are well-established, suggesting increased sensitivity to noxious stimulation among AAs compared to NHWs. In our previous work, we have demonstrated enhanced responsiveness in AAs to noxious stimulation on several tasks that indirectly assess endogenous pain-inhibitory systems that are at least partially opioid-mediated. Ethnic differences in endogenous opioid neurotransmitters in the central and peripheral nervous system suggest that these systems function less efficiently among AAs and may account for a substantial proportion of the ethnic differences observed in pain and analgesic responses. In addition, pharmacogenetic research shows substantial ethnic group differences in the metabolism, clinical effectiveness, and side-effect profiles of many drugs; including analgesics. The overwhelming majority of clinically used opioids elicit their effects through activation of the mu-opioid receptor, making it an extremely relevant target for investigation. We propose to examine ethnic differences in the supraspinal endogenous opioid system using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of mu-opioid receptors employing the mu-selective agonist [11C] carfentanil. Healthy AAs and sex, age, SES matched, NHW participants will undergo one baseline (non-pain) and one capsaicin-induced pain PET session using [11C] carfentanil. The current proposal will measure mu-opioid binding potential and examine its role in ethnic group differences in pain sensitivity. Our overarching objective is to investigate the endogenous opioid system as the mechanism underlying the association between ethnicity and pain sensitivity, thereby enhancing our understanding of the neurobiology of ethnic differences. These findings will have far reaching implications; including elucidating a tangible, physiological mechanism underlying ethnic differences in pain, for prescribing analgesics and advancing personalized medicine. Enhancing our understanding of mechanisms underlying ethnic differences in pain is likely to assist in the refinement of targeted interventios to alleviate clinical pain in at-risk populations, and aid in reducing pain-related health disparites. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pain is a major public health problem producing enormous economic costs and profound suffering; considerable evidence demonstrates disparities in the experience of acute and clinical pain, with African Americans experiencing a greater burden of pain when compared to non-Hispanic Whites. The current proposal will measure the endogenous opioid system and examine its role in disparities in pain report. Our goal is to investigate the endogenous opioid system as the mechanism underlying the disparities in pain sensitivity, thereby enhancing our understanding of the neurobiology of ethnic/racial

"Estradiol and Zoster Associated Orofacial Pain ABSTRACT People with herpes zoster (HZ) or “shingles” can suffer from orofacial pain. Orofacial HZ is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the trigeminal ganglia. Importantly, women report HZ pain three times more often than men, but the mechanism for this sex disparity is unknown. A screen by our lab of over 20,000 genes in five different regions of the orofacial pain pathway revealed that the greatest change in gene expression occurred in the thalamus, such that glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) were elevated at proestrus (high 17 β-estradiol, E2) but not diestrus (low E2). In preliminary studies we showed that female rats have a greater VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response in comparison to males; mirroring the human sex difference. We also showed that reducing E2 production in male and female rats increases their nociceptive response and lastly, knock-down of VGAT expression in the thalamus increased the nociceptive response. Based on these studies we hypothesized that E2 attenuates orofacial nociception by increasing GAD2 or VGAT, enhancing GABAergic neural inhibition within the thalamus to reduce pain. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will characterize thalamic control of the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. The working hypothesis for Aim 1 is that GABA interneurons inhibit neurons in the thalamus to reduce VZV induced nociception. To test this hypothesis first, VZV induced nociception and neuronal activity will be recorded after attenuating inhibitory interneurons. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be determined after modulating GAD2 and VGAT expression in these interneurons. Aim 2 will determine the role of sex steroids in modulating the VZV induced nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 will increase expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus causing attenuation of neuronal activity and the nociceptive response. To test this hypothesis first, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be measured in female and male rats after administering E2 or reducing E2 production. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be measured after knock-down of GAD2 and VGAT expression in rats with varied E2 levels. Aim 3 will characterize the mechanism by which sex steroids modulate VGAT and GAD2 to affect the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 binds to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) causing increased expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus resulting in attenuation of nociception. To test this idea, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be quantitated in rats after mutating ERα promoter sites using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. From these three aims we expect to determine 1) that GABA interneurons inhibit thalamic signaling to reduce orofacial pain, 2) that GAD2 and VGAT increases in these neurons through an ERα dependent mechanism, and 3) that GAD2 and VGAT are responsible, in part, for the sex difference observed in HZ pain. Identifying a mechanism by which E2 affects HZ-associated pain will provide new targets for treating people suffering from this chronic disorder. Project Narrative These studies will evaluate the role of two neuron inhibitory genes, glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). Thalamic expression of these two genes was regulated by estrogen and the role of these genes in the underlying molecular pathogenesis of Zoster associated nociception will be evaluated in this application. These experiments will provide valuable insights into an area of Herpes Zoster pain biology and pathology that are poorly understood and highly prioritized by the NIDCR. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel genes by which 17β-estradiol affects orofacial hypersensitivity will be identified, providing a greater understanding of why females suffer greater pain and allow for

"Relationship of Ambient Air Pollution Exposures with Vaso-Occlusive Pain Crises in Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common inherited disorders, effects an estimated 100,000 Americans, mostly of African-American descent, as well as millions globally. Despite current preventative/treatment modalities, SCD morbidity is associated with premature mortality and substantial financial and quality of life costs. A hallmark of SCD is the vaso-occlusive pain crisis, a recurrent, unpredictable, and debilitating event. Demographic factors, genotype, psychosocial factors, socioeconomic status (SES) and environmental exposures have been linked with SCD pain crises. Although the precise pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive crises is not fully understood, identified mechanisms are markedly similar to those postulated for the well-established associations of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with ambient air pollution exposures. While it is biologically plausible that exposure to ambient air pollution could be associated with increased risk of sickle cell pain crises, epidemiologic research is very limited. The proposed study takes advantage of an existing statewide hospital administrative dataset; complex, innovative spatio-temporal particulate matter (PM) and component exposure models developed for previously funded research; hierarchical Bayesian ozone exposure models developed by the US EPA; and the case crossover study design. We will examine whether hospitalizations and emergency department visits for vaso-occlusive pain crises among SCD patients are associated with short-term exposures to ambient air pollutants. The proposed study will, to the best of our knowledge, be the first to evaluate comprehensively the effects of ozone, PM2.5, and biologically relevant traffic-related PM components on SCD vaso-occlusive pain crises among a statewide population with a high rate of reported SCD-related mortality. The results of our study could advance understanding of pathophysiological responses to air pollution among a population experiencing debilitating and costly adverse outcomes. Project Narrative Though it is biologically plausible that exposure to ambient air pollution could be associated with increased risk of sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive pain crises, research is extremely limited. We propose to use a statewide hospitalization dataset and spatio-temporal air pollution models to examine whether short-term air pollution exposures are associated with increased risks of sickle cell disease pain crises.",Relationship of Ambient Air Pollution Exposures with Vaso-Occlusive Pain Crises in Sickle Cell Disease,9591929,R21HL135545,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Hemolytic Anemia ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hemoglobinopathies ', ' Hemoglobinopathies / Iron Metabolism ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inborn error ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Ozone ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Suggestion ', ' Time ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Cross-Over Studies ', ' Crossover Studies ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' drepanocyte ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' Individual ', ' O3 exposure ', ' ozone exposure ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Policies ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disease epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' Modality ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' vascular inflammation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Coagulation ', ' Clotting ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' vasoocclusive pain ', ' vaso-occlusive pain ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' clinical development ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2018,146098,0.325609302933972
"Opioid prescribing disparities in a public health crisis: The case of pediatric post-surgical pain management Abstract African Americans adults are less likely to receive analgesics, particularly opioids, even after controlling for pain severity. Research in the pediatric surgical population is more limited but the pattern of disparate use of opioids appear consistent with adult research. While it cannot be assumed that opioids are always the best approach to post-operative pain treatment for children, differential use driven by non-clinical judgments is of concern. This concern, however, exists at a time when opioid addiction is a public health crisis. Although most adolescents who misuse pain medications initially receive them for free from a friend or family member, adolescent access to prescribed opioids has also increased. The relationship between racial disparities in postoperative pain management and opioid addition is complex. Allowing a child's pain to go unaddressed because of concerns driven by bias is unacceptable. On the other hand, overprescribing can enhance risk for addiction or diversion of medications to the illicit market with broad societal implications. Striking the right balance requires empirical evidence that supports data-driven decision-making. This proposal aims to strengthen the evidence base regarding use of opioid pain medications in children following surgical procedures and to explore the inter-related impacts of policy, clinical need, and socio-demographic factors by combining Medicaid claims and electronic health record data with findings from a statewide opioid policy inventory. This research will be done Ohio, a state with the 5th highest opioid mortality in the nation using clinical data from Nationwide Children's Hospital, the nation's largest pediatric surgical provider, performing over 35,000 pediatric surgical procedures each year across 10 pediatric surgical subspecialties and both in-patient and ambulatory surgery centers. We will focus on discharge prescribing of opioids in three high volume pediatric surgical procedures: tonsillectomy/adenoidectomy, supracondylar fracture, and appendectomy. Specifically, we aim to: 1) Determine the extent of and trends in racial disparities in postoperative discharge opioid prescribing since the 2011 onset of enhanced opioid prescription reduction activities; and 2) Develop an expanded model, including pain scores and other EMR data, to assess the linkage between differential opioid use for pediatric postoperative pain and opioid use-related outcomes. This analysis will enhance understanding of disparities in opioid use for pain management and support decision making for policy and practice that maximizes equity in pain management while remaining focused on reducing misuse and addiction. Public Health Relevance  African American pediatric surgery patients are less likely to receive an opioid prescription for pain management at discharge than their White counterparts. This disparity exists in the midst of a national opioid epidemic that is driving implementation of use reduction policies that could further expand disparities. This study aims to explore the inter-related impacts of policy, clinical need, and socio-demographic factors on disparities in postoperative discharge opioid prescribing by combining Medicaid claims and electronic medical record data with findings from a statewide opioid policy inventory.",Opioid prescribing disparities in a public health crisis: The case of pediatric post-surgical pain management,9542885,R21MD011767,"['Adenoidectomy ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Ambulatory Surgical Procedures ', ' Outpatient Surgery ', ' Ambulatory Surgery ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' Appendectomy ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' driving ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Heroin ', ' Diamorphine ', ' Diacetylmorphine ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Fracture ', ' bone fracture ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Pediatric Hospitals ', "" Children's Hospital "", ' Humeral Fractures ', ' Humerus Fracture ', ' Inpatients ', ' Equipment and supply inventories ', ' Inventory ', ' Judgment ', ' Medicaid ', ' Ohio ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Postoperative Pain ', ' postsurgical pain ', ' post-surgical pain ', ' Post-operative Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Policy Making ', ' Postoperative Period ', ' Postoperative ', ' Post-Operative ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Time ', ' Tonsillectomy ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Friends ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Family member ', ' Caring ', ' Procedures ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' juvenile human ', ' juvenile ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Policies ', ' Pediatric Surgery ', ' Pediatric Surgical Procedures ', ' Severities ', ' Complex ', ' Pattern ', ' Opiate Addiction ', ' opioid dependent ', ' opioid dependence ', ' opioid addiction ', ' Opiate Dependence ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' trend ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' addictive disorder ', ' addiction ', ' public health relevance ', ' evidence base ', ' patient population ', ' non-medical use ', ' nonmedical use ', ' overdose death ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' opioid medication ', ' opiate medication ', ' licit opioid ', ' prescription opioid ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' prescription pain reliever ', ' opioid intake ', ' opioid drug use ', ' opioid consumption ', ' opiate use ', ' opiate intake ', ' opiate drug use ', ' opiate consumption ', ' opioid use ', ' implicit bias ', ' opioid legislation ', ' opioid law ', ' opioid guideline ', ' opioid policy ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid related death ', ' opioid overdose death ', ' opioid deaths ', ' opiate mortality ', ' opiate deaths ', ' opioid mortality ', ' pain score ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH INST NATIONWIDE CHILDREN'S HOSP,R21,2018,228000,0.35299424811676
"Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PTSD and chronic pain are highly prevalent and each is associated with long-term disability and substance abuse, exacting enormous emotional, functional, and financial tolls on individuals and society. PTSD and chronic pain are frequently co-morbid with overlap between 20% and 70%, representing an enormous public health problem. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which PTSD and chronic pain become intertwined is limited. The majority of studies of the PTSD/chronic pain co-morbidity are cross- sectional, and focused on a single chronic pain condition, limiting causal inferences and generalizability to other chronic pain conditions. Chronic pain is also related to a high prevalence of substance abuse. To understand how trauma-related PTSD, and resilience and vulnerability factors contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse requires prospective designs. Such research is vital among inner-city African American women, who are more likely to experience traumatic stress and pain, but are less likely to be treated appropriately; a phenomenon perhaps leading to greater risk for disability and substance abuse. We propose to examine 3 models related to the development of PTSD/chronic pain pairing and development of substance abuse in people initially presenting with acute pain (not caused by a traumatic event) in a 6-month prospective design. First is the Main Effects Model in which the level of PTSD symptoms at baseline will predict the likelihood of a transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse at 6 months. Second is the Moderation Model in which baseline vulnerability and resilience factors interact with PTSD symptoms to predict the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later. Third is the Mediator Model in which relationships between baseline levels of PTSD symptoms and the development of chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later are mediated by vulnerability and resilience factors at 3 months. Inner-city women (N=600) presenting to an Emergency Department with a complaint of acute bodily pain, ages 18-40 yrs, will be recruited. Only women presenting with acute pelvic/abdominal, neck/shoulder or low back pain, and who do not have a chronic pain history will be enrolled. We will assess trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, pain sensitivity, substance dependence and abuse, acute pain and psychosocial resilience and vulnerability factors across 3 waves (baseline, 3- and 6-months), and obtain additional phone assessment of pain intensity and interference at 1-, 2-, 4-, and 5-months. Inner-city women were chosen because of their high likelihood of exposure to ongoing traumatic events and the opportunity to illuminate a health disparity involving the PTSD/chronic pain pairing among inner-city minority women in particular. The public health problem posed by co-morbid PTSD, chronic pain and substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic pain and developing substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PTSD and chronic pain frequently co-occur with 20-70% of people with chronic pain conditions reporting trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. The public health problem posed by co-occurring PTSD, chronic pain and concomitant substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Results from this prospective study of how PTSD influences the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse will shed light on this well-documented but poorly understood co-morbidity. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions.",Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women,9695130,R01DA039522,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Neck ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pelvis ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Shoulder ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' therapy selection ', ' chronic pain ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' psychosocial ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain interference ', ' Pain intensity ', ' traumatic event ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' Assessment tool ', ' recruit ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' trauma exposure ', ' ']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2018,8467,0.334506989553484
"Treatment of Consequences of Female Genital Cutting Project Summary/Abstract The National Pain Strategy notes the importance of addressing pain in minority populations to reduce health disparities. One such population is female refugees who have been victim to female genital cutting (FGC) --- which is known to cause sexual pain. The objective of the proposed research is to collect empirical data to (1) inform the conceptualization of sexual pain and other outcomes among Somali women living in Minnesota who have experienced FGC, (2) promote healthcare practices that minimize sexual pain, and (3) develop decision- making tool(s) and education seminars driven by study findings. The majority of Somali girls undergo infibulation when originally cut, which involves stitching the vaginal opening shut. Deinfibulation (i.e. opening the circumcision/infibulation scar) may decrease pain and is necessary before vaginal birth. It is recommended before labor and delivery; however, many patients wait until labor and delivery to undergo deinfibulation –thus increasing a risk in tears. Little is known about how sexual pain and sexual function are impacted by the timing of deinfibulation. To better understand sexual pain in relation to FGC, we will rely upon conceptual models that utilize a biopsychosocial approach, integrating biological, psychological, and cultural considerations. These models include fear-avoidance, endurance, and resilience. We will partner with a community-based organization (SoLaHmo) and two large medical clinics serving Somali American women to conduct 75 qualitative interviews, 300 computer assisted surveys of Somali-American married women 18-45 years who have experienced FGC to accomplish the following aims: Aim 1: Qualitatively investigate sexual pain characteristics and meaning ascribed to sexual pain. Aim 2: Establish reference levels using descriptive statistics to quantify sexual pain characteristics (presence, frequency, intensity), sexual function, pain responses (fear avoidance, endurance, resilience), and moderator variables (acculturation and shared decision making) in this population. Aim 3: Among women who have vaginally delivered one or more babies, determine if sexual pain characteristics and sexual function are associated with the timing of deinfibulation with first child. Aim 4: Among women reporting sexual pain in Aim 3, determine if pain responses (fear avoidance, endurance, resilience) are associated with sexual pain and sexual function, and whether these associations are modified by degree of acculturation --- while adjusting for timing of deinfibulation. The long-term goal is to identify mechanisms that will lead to better pain management in this population. Completion of these novel study aims will generate information to develop evidence-based and culturally- sensitive medical and psychological interventions for women who have undergone FGC. Due to recent immigration patterns, there has been a large increase in girls and women in the U.S. healthcare system who have experienced female genital cutting (FGC; a.k.a. female circumcision) --- a common outcome of FGC is sexual pain. The proposed research project will investigate factors that may contribute to increased risk of developing chronic sexual pain among circumcised Somali American women living in Minnesota. The overall goal is to gather information that may used by mental health and medical professionals to provide culturally- sensitive and empiricall- informed healthcare.",Treatment of Consequences of Female Genital Cutting,9448172,R01HD091685,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Circumcision ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Communities ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Episiotomy ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Headache ', ' head ache ', ' Head Pain ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mothers ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Postpartum Hemorrhage ', ' Post-partum Hemorrhage ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Somalia ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' UNICEF ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Woman ', ' Female Circumcision ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Immigrant ', ' Infibulations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Vaginal delivery ', ' Vaginal birth ', ' Vaginal delivery procedure ', ' female genitalia cutting ', ' female external genitalia cutting ', ' female external genital cutting ', ' female genital cutting ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' evidence base ', ' shared decision making ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2018,596179,0.3284295363606766
"Neural mechanisms underlying psychosocial contributions to ethnic group differences in pain Considerable evidence demonstrates that pain disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, especially African Americans (AAs), who experience frequent, severe and disabling chronic pain compared to their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts. These racial and ethnic disparities extend to many chronic pain conditions, but are perhaps best documented in people with osteoarthritis (OA). Previous research revealed that AAs with OA experience more frequent and severe clinical pain and disability and show a quantitative sensory testing profile suggesting impaired pain inhibition and enhanced generalized pain facilitation compared to NHWs. In addition, previous findings demonstrated higher pain catastrophizing (a tendency to negatively evaluate one's ability to cope with pain and to respond to anticipated or actual pain in a heightened negative cognitive and emotional manner) among AAs compared to NHWs. While multiple factors inevitably contribute, cognitive and affective processes and ethnic group differences in central pain processing represent potentially important determinants of greater clinical pain among African Americans. Despite its pervasive negative effects, no neuroimaging study to date has experimentally manipulated pain catastrophizing and measured cerebral activity during experimentally-induced pain to determine the neural mechanisms whereby catastrophizing impacts pain responses. Moreover, the extent to which the influence of pain catastrophizing on these central pathways contributes to ethnic group differences in the experience of pain remains unexplored. Therefore, the overall goal for this mentored career development proposal (K22) is to elucidate the neural mechanism involved in pain catastrophizing and its influence on pain processing in different ethnic groups. Primary training goals for the current proposal are to: 1) develop a comprehensive knowledge base in neuroimaging techniques, methodological designs, data acquisition, data analyses, and interpretation of findings; 2) expand knowledge of advanced pain assessment skills including quantitative sensory testing and clinical models of pain; 3) Obtain expertise in principles of experimental design and statistical methodology utilized for biomedical research, including neuroimaging studies; and 4) enhance translational research skills to function as an independent investigator. Study 1 (Phase I) will determine whether pain catastrophizing contributes to ethnic group differences in pain-related brain function, clinical pain, and pain sensitivity among AAs and NHWs with knee OA. Study 2 (Phase II) will characterize the impact of an anti-catastrophizing manipulation on central pain processes and pain among AAs and NHWs with knee OA. The proposed career development plan extends from the PI's prior work on pain catastrophizing and mechanisms of pain processing, and will also provide the neuroimaging training and expertise to propel a promising young investigator at the intersection of pain and neuroscience research. Chronic pain is a significant public health problem and is associated with increased economic, functional, and psychological burden. While pain affects all segments of the population, racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., particularly African Americans, experience more frequent, severe and disabling chronic pain compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. While multiple factors inevitably contribute, cognitive and affective processes and ethnic group differences in central pain processing represent potentially important determinants of greater clinical pain among African Americans. The proposed work will elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the influence of catastrophizing on pain response in different ethnic groups.

"Acceptance and commitment therapy to address the psychosocial co-morbidities of chronic pain in aging people living with HIV PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chronic pain affects a very high proportion of aging people living with HIV (aPLWH) and is thought to be related to both direct toxicity of HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) and by psychosocial factors that negatively affect pain (i.e. loneliness, HIV stigma). PLWH are also at increased risk for prescription opiate misuse. However as PLWH age, non-opiate medications used for pain can contribute to other negative outcomes such as falls, altered mental status and gastrointestinal bleeding. Thus there is a critical need for the development of novel interventions in the management of chronic pain in aPLWH that consider the psychological co- morbidities of aging with HIV and that can minimize the need for prescription medications. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has previously been evaluated in older persons with chronic pain and has demonstrated higher levels of satisfaction and efficacy when compared to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). ACT has never been evaluated in aPLWH for chronic pain, but has theoretical advantages over CBT for this population. Specifically several negatively modifying factors of CBT efficacy such as cognitive deficits are common in aPLWH. The overarching objective of this study is to determine the acceptability and feasibility of an ACT intervention for the management of chronic pain adapted to aPLWH. To accomplish this objective I will 1) train lay personnel to perform ACT to determine feasibility of this approach for future implementation, 2) conduct uncontrolled group ACT in aPLWH to generate participant feedback and questionnaire data to inform ACT adaption with the assistance of a steering commitee, and 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the acceptability of adapted ACT compared to pain education. At completion of this grant we expect to have successfully trained lay personnel to perform group ACT, adapted ACT from quantitative and qualitative data collected from an uncontrolled study of group ACT, and determined whether ACT is acceptable and feasible as an intervention in aPLWH. These expected outcomes may benefit other aging populations with chronic pain that are enriched for psychosocial co-morbidities such as persons who inject drugs, the socioeconomically disadvantaged, and racial or gender minorities. This proposal is aligned with the Office of AIDS Research High Priorities to better understand “HIV-associated comorbidities” which includes pain and to “Reduce Health Disparities in treatment outcomes of those living with HIV/AIDS” and with the National Pain Strategy to “expand investment … in the development of safe and effective pain treatments.” PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic pain impacts a large proportion of aging people living with HIV (aPLWH) and involves factors directly related to HIV (neurotoxicity) and psychosocial co-morbidities common in aPLWH (i.e. social isolation and loneliness). Novel interventions that acknowledge these psychosocial co-morbidities may improve the efficacy of chronic pain management and minimize the use of potentially dangerous medications. This grant proposes to adapt and pilot a pain psychotherapy approach using group acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in aPLWH with chronic pain.",Acceptance and commitment therapy to address the

"The Role of Opioid Adherence Profiles in Cancer Pain Self-Management and Outcomes ABSTRACT/ PROJECT SUMMARY  Pain is one of the top symptoms producing the greatest negative impact on cancer patients' quality of life. Unfortunately, one in three cancer patients will experience moderate to severe pain due to consequences of cancer, its treatments or both. For one in three, pain will persist after completion of active cancer treatments. With 15.5 million Americans living with cancer, this is a substantial public health matter. While many complementary and alternative medicine approaches exist, their clinical use for cancer pain remains seriously hampered by lack of robust evidence, short-term relief, and excessive out-of-pocket costs. In turn, opioid pain medications are prescribed to cancer patients – who notably, also remain excluded from most state and policy initiatives on opioids. Long-term (>3 months ) opioid therapy is also prevalent among cancer outpatients when compared to age-sex matched controls. Despite this, cancer patients have been almost invariably excluded from T he recent Health management” studies investigating the outcomes of long-term opioid therapy and use. and Human   Services Pain Management Inter-Agency Taskforce has identified “self- as one of the best practices in improving chronic pain. However,interventions cannot be designed due to serious gaps in our current understanding of cancer outpatients' pain self-management and especially their opioid self-management. Recent systematic reviews demonstrate that most cancer pain interventions (based on knowledge translation and conducted predominantly or exclusively with White patients) improve knowledge, but largely do not improve outcomes that matter to patients such as daily pain, function, or quality of life. This underscores a need to continue in search of other targets for intervention development. This 6-month prospective cohort study will generate new knowledge about longitudinal pain, opioid self- management trajectories, and associated outcomes among cancer outpatients in the context of daily pain, pain flares, key clinical moderators and covariates. A total of 400 cancer outpatients (50% African Americans; 50% women) who are prescribed long-acting (LA) opioids will be recruited from three urban oncology centers. Longitudinal opioid self-management patterns will be captured in real-time using medication event monitoring system (MEMS®). Daily background pain, pain flares, and use of “as-needed” opioids will be collected using the self-report tracker (SRT®). Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) to be assessed are changes in pain levels, function, sleep, and health-related quality of life. Health services outcomes include unplanned hospitalizations and emergency department use (healthcare utilization). This study will supply rigorous data, comprehensive set of sociodemographic and clinical covariates, and key moderators upon which further research for pain-self management best practices can be based, including targets to ameliorate racial disparities. Overall, this research can have a sustained impact on the science of cancer pain management.

"Examining the effects of contextually-imposed cognitive load on providers' chronic pain treatment decisions for racially and socioeconomically diverse patients Project Summary/Abstract Compared to individuals who are White and have high socioeconomic status (SES), those who are Black and have low SES experience greater pain and disability and are more likely to receive suboptimal pain care. One potential contributor to these disparities is biased provider decision-making. There is compelling evidence that providers are influenced by patient race and SES when making treatment decisions. Pain is subjective, and providers often make pain care decisions with insufficient information. Consequently, providers may fill these information gaps with stereotypes about race and SES groups, leading to systematic differences in pain care. According to the dual process model (DPM) and previous studies, people are more likely to use such stereotypes when they are under high cognitive load (i.e., mental workload). Health care settings place high cognitive demands on providers via time pressures, noises levels, and interruptions. Another factor that may contribute to biased provider decision-making is implicit beliefs (subconscious, automatic stereotyping), which have been found to be associated with health care disparities. One stereotype belief relevant to pain care is that Black and low SES individuals are more pain tolerant. Previous studies suggest that many providers hold these beliefs about pain tolerance. Consistent with the DPM, providers who are under high cognitive load and who have strong beliefs that Black and low SES people are more pain tolerant may be particularly likely to recommend fewer pain treatments for Black and low SES patients. To test these hypotheses, the proposed study will recruit physician residents and fellows to view videos and make pain treatment decisions for 12 computer-simulated patients with low back pain that vary by race (Black/White) and SES (low/high); treatment options will include analgesic medications, complementary and alternative approaches, lifestyle changes, and referrals to specialty care. Half of the providers will be randomized to the high cognitive load group in which they will be interrupted during the treatment decision task to make Morphine Equivalent Dose conversions. Providers in the control group will not be interrupted during the treatment decision task. Providers’ implicit beliefs about race and SES differences in pain tolerance will be measured with Implicit Association Tests. The primary analyses will examine the main and interaction effects of patient race and SES on providers’ treatment decisions for chronic pain (aim 1), examine the main and interaction effects of patient race [SES] and cognitive load on providers’ treatment decisions (aim 2), and examine the main and interaction effects of patient race [SES], cognitive load, and providers’ implicit beliefs about race [SES] differences in pain tolerance on providers’ treatment decisions (aim 3). Multilevel modeling will allow for the examination of these effects at the individual provider and group levels. The proposed study is highly innovative and represents a crucial step in combating disparities in pain care. Ultimately, the project findings may lead to evidence-based interventions that target cognitive load and biased provider beliefs and thereby reduce disparities. Project Narrative Compared to individuals who are White and have high socioeconomic status (SES), those who are Black and have low SES are at heightened risk for receiving suboptimal pain care. The proposed project will examine the effects of patient race and SES, contextually-imposed cognitive load, and providers’ implicit beliefs about pain tolerance on their treatment decisions for chronic pain. This research is of high potential significance, as it may lead to interventions that target cognitive load and biased provider beliefs and thereby reduce disparities in pain care.",Examining the effects of contextually-imposed cognitive load on providers' chronic pain treatment decisions for racially and socioeconomically diverse patients,9760494,F31MD014058,"['experience ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Dose ', ' Interruption ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' virtual human ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' combat ', ' mindfulness ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' cognitive load ', ' cognitive burden ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' health care disparity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' recruit ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' morphine equivalent ', ' morphine equivalence ', ' Affect ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Belief ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Decision Making ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Empathy ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Noise ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pressure ', ' Productivity ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Subconscious ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Work Load ', ' Workload ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Psyche structure ', ' mental ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' psychosocial ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' ']",NIMHD,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,F31,2019,43220,0.3356744290252943
"Key Molecular Mechanisms of Chronic Pain Vulnerability in Women Experiencing MVC Abstract Exposure to traumatic events is common in life. In industrialized nations, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are one of the most common types of trauma, with over 50 million MVCs occurring worldwide each year. The great majority of individuals experiencing MVC do not have serious injury; in the US more than 90% of individuals seen in the emergency department after MVC are discharged home after evaluation. However, a substantial proportion of such individuals develop chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSP).  Most individuals who develop chronic MSP following MVC are women. This fact is consistent with the marked increase in MSP burden experienced by women vs. men in other settings. Biopsychosocial mechanisms responsible for this increased vulnerability remain poorly understood, leading the NIH and eminent pain scientists to call for more research aimed at addressing this knowledge gap.  The candidate, Dr. Sarah Linnstaedt, is an RNA biologist who seeks a K01 career development award to gain the training necessary to perform studies that will provide important new insights into the biologic mechanisms, and the interactions between these mechanisms and cognitive/psychosocial factors, that contribute to chronic MSP pathogenesis in women. Specifically, the proposed career development award will provide Dr. Linnstaedt with the knowledge and skills necessary to (1) evaluate candidate biological mechanisms within contemporary, state-of-the-art biopsychsocial models of chronic MSP that include influential cognitive and psychosocial factors, (2) perform studies of sex-specific biological mechanisms that previous data, and the candidate’s pilot data, suggest contribute to chronic MSP in women, and (3) evaluate potential interactions between biological and psychosocial factors. Data for this work will be drawn from biologic samples collected as part of a mentor’s longitudinal cohort study of chronic MSP pathogensis after MVC. By the end of the award period, Dr. Linnstaedt will have the necessary knowledge, experience, skills, and data to obtain an R01 and become an independently-funded translational research scientist whose work addresses the current marked disparity in chronic pain incidence among women. Project Narrative Little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms leading to increased chronic pain in women. The candidate's first-in-kind studies will use biological samples and cognitive/psychosocial data from a longitudinal cohort of individuals enrolled following motor vehicle collision trauma to evaluate candidate mediators of pain pathogenesis in women.

"Evidence-based Approaches to Chronic Pain Management in Youth with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain is a complex and challenging problem associated with significant disability and suffering among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). There is a gap in scientific knowledge in understanding the progression of chronic SCD pain that hinders the development of effective therapeutic options. Psychological treatments are key components of comprehensive chronic pain management, but currently have limited efficacy for managing SCD pain in youth. Thus, the long-term career goal of this candidate is to become an independent clinical investigator with expertise in SCD pain to establish a novel stepped care model of delivering behavioral interventions for SCD pain management that are easily implemented in real-world clinical settings. She will begin to achieve these goals by obtaining clinical and research training in SCD pain physiology and pharmacology and training in implementation science, health disparities research, and advanced quantitative and qualitative methods to support a patient-centered approach to pain intervention development, optimization, and evaluation. Her career development plan is uniquely tailored to fulfill gaps in her training in pediatric pain under the mentorship of national and international leaders at Emory University and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. The training plan leverages the well- supported infrastructure of the largest pediatric sickle cell program in the US as well as national and institutional opportunities to ensure didactic, experiential, and specialized individual instruction. The research objectives of this application are to first rigorously characterize trajectories of chronic pain over a 24-month period in a cohort of youth with SCD (ages 10-18 years). Data will help identify modifiable psychosocial and family risk factors (e.g., elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms, caregiver stress) that predict different chronic pain trajectories to inform relevant behavioral treatment targets in a family-focused cognitive-behavioral intervention. Standard qualitative and mixed-method approaches and iterative design using focus groups, key informant interviews, and community stakeholders will be used to develop and refine intervention content and format and solicit feedback to enhance the success of future implementation in clinical settings. The result will be a family-focused, culturally informed, evidence-based intervention termed Back2Living (“Building Adaptive Coping and Knowledge To improve daily Living”) that is amenable for implementation in real-world clinical settings. A pilot proof-of-concept trial will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Back2Living with youth with chronic SCD pain and their parents. An adaptive treatment approach with 4-8 treatment sessions selected on the basis of baseline assessment will target comorbid psychosocial risk factors and allow flexibility in tailoring treatment components to meet individual family needs to reduce pain interference, pain, and healthcare use. Results of this proposal may ultimately contribute to novel comprehensive treatment approaches to treat chronic pain in pediatric SCD and improve quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although chronic pain is a significant problem that contributes to poor quality of life in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about the individual and family psychosocial factors that contribute to chronic SCD pain, which severely hinders the development of effective treatment options. This research will characterize the natural course of chronic SCD pain and determine psychosocial risk factors that impact chronic pain in youth with SCD to inform the development of an adaptive family-focused behavioral intervention that is tailored to meet individual family needs to reduce pain-related disability. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a psychosocial risk stratification to inform comprehensive treatment approaches for SCD pain management and prevention.",Evidence-based Approaches to

"Prospective Study of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Chronic Pain and Pain Burden ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden on racial and ethnic minorities. Substantial inequities exist in the pain treatment received by African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. Data suggest that members of these minority groups are not only more likely to develop chronic pain but also to have this pain accompanied by greater pain burden, i.e., greater suffering, poorer life quality, and worse functional impairment. Only modest headway has been made in understanding why race and ethnicity confer pain inequities and how best to address these disparities. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to contribute to the reduction or outright elimination o racial and ethnic pain disparities. The near-term goal of the planned research is to identify a small set of the most promising intervention targets, from among the plethora of posited explanations, for reducing or eliminating racial/ethnic pain disparities. The planned study would be, to our knowledge, the first ever prospective examination of factors posited to underlie racial and ethnic disparities in the transition from acute to chronic pain. The study would also be the first to investigate these issues in the important context of recovery following serious physical injury requiring hospitalization. For the proposed research, a sample of 900 adult survivors of serious physical injury, comprised of roughly equal proportions of African-Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Whites, will be recruited during hospitalization from large trauma centers in Los Angeles, CA and Philadelphia, PA. Interviews will be conducted during hospitalization and at 3-, and 12-month follow-up. Medical records will provide information on injury severity and medication use in-hospital which may influence the course of pain. The specific aims are (1) to determine whether African-American and Latino physical injury survivors experience more severe pain following injury relative to their non-Latino White counterparts; (2) to determine whether African-American and Latino injury survivors experience greater pain burden relative to their non- Latino White counterparts; (3) to determine whether African-American and Latino differences in pain severity or pain burden can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for interventions aimed at reduction or elimination of pain outcome disparities; and (4) To determine whether pain outcomes in at-risk minority groups can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for group-tailored interventions to reduce pain severity and pain burden irrespective of whether these candidates contribute to between-group pain disparities. The knowledge gained from the proposed research has high potential to accelerate efforts aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic pain disparities by identifying promising targets for prevention and intervention efforts to close the pain gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden for African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. The proposed prospective investigation will study African-American, Latino, and non-Latino White physical injury survivors from initial hospitalization for a period of one year to identify promising intervention targets to reduce or eliminate racial/ethnic pain disparities.",Prospective Study of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Chronic Pain and Pain Burden,9644913,R01MD010372,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Goals ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medical Records ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' trauma centers ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' chronic pain ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' Sampling ', ' functional disability ', ' Functional impairment ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' pain outcome ', ' pain reduction ', ' reduce pain ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2019,684013,0.4157326854888374
"Estradiol and Zoster Associated Orofacial Pain ABSTRACT People with herpes zoster (HZ) or “shingles” can suffer from orofacial pain. Orofacial HZ is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the trigeminal ganglia. Importantly, women report HZ pain three times more often than men, but the mechanism for this sex disparity is unknown. A screen by our lab of over 20,000 genes in five different regions of the orofacial pain pathway revealed that the greatest change in gene expression occurred in the thalamus, such that glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) were elevated at proestrus (high 17 β-estradiol, E2) but not diestrus (low E2). In preliminary studies we showed that female rats have a greater VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response in comparison to males; mirroring the human sex difference. We also showed that reducing E2 production in male and female rats increases their nociceptive response and lastly, knock-down of VGAT expression in the thalamus increased the nociceptive response. Based on these studies we hypothesized that E2 attenuates orofacial nociception by increasing GAD2 or VGAT, enhancing GABAergic neural inhibition within the thalamus to reduce pain. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will characterize thalamic control of the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. The working hypothesis for Aim 1 is that GABA interneurons inhibit neurons in the thalamus to reduce VZV induced nociception. To test this hypothesis first, VZV induced nociception and neuronal activity will be recorded after attenuating inhibitory interneurons. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be determined after modulating GAD2 and VGAT expression in these interneurons. Aim 2 will determine the role of sex steroids in modulating the VZV induced nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 will increase expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus causing attenuation of neuronal activity and the nociceptive response. To test this hypothesis first, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be measured in female and male rats after administering E2 or reducing E2 production. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be measured after knock-down of GAD2 and VGAT expression in rats with varied E2 levels. Aim 3 will characterize the mechanism by which sex steroids modulate VGAT and GAD2 to affect the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 binds to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) causing increased expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus resulting in attenuation of nociception. To test this idea, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be quantitated in rats after mutating ERα promoter sites using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. From these three aims we expect to determine 1) that GABA interneurons inhibit thalamic signaling to reduce orofacial pain, 2) that GAD2 and VGAT increases in these neurons through an ERα dependent mechanism, and 3) that GAD2 and VGAT are responsible, in part, for the sex difference observed in HZ pain. Identifying a mechanism by which E2 affects HZ-associated pain will provide new targets for treating people suffering from this chronic disorder. Project Narrative These studies will evaluate the role of two neuron inhibitory genes, glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). Thalamic expression of these two genes was regulated by estrogen and the role of these genes in the underlying molecular pathogenesis of Zoster associated nociception will be evaluated in this application. These experiments will provide valuable insights into an area of Herpes Zoster pain biology and pathology that are poorly understood and highly prioritized by the NIDCR. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel genes by which 17β-estradiol affects orofacial hypersensitivity will be identified, providing a greater understanding of why females suffer greater pain and allow for targeted control of their expression to reduce orofacial pain.",Estradiol and Zoster Associated Orofacial Pain,9655318,R01DE026749,"['Affect ', ' Aromatase ', ' Subfamily XIX Cytochrome P450 ', '

"Relationship of Ambient Air Pollution Exposures with Vaso-Occlusive Pain Crises in Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary Sickle cell disease (SCD), one of the most common inherited disorders, effects an estimated 100,000 Americans, mostly of African-American descent, as well as millions globally. Despite current preventative/treatment modalities, SCD morbidity is associated with premature mortality and substantial financial and quality of life costs. A hallmark of SCD is the vaso-occlusive pain crisis, a recurrent, unpredictable, and debilitating event. Demographic factors, genotype, psychosocial factors, socioeconomic status (SES) and environmental exposures have been linked with SCD pain crises. Although the precise pathophysiology of vaso-occlusive crises is not fully understood, identified mechanisms are markedly similar to those postulated for the well-established associations of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality with ambient air pollution exposures. While it is biologically plausible that exposure to ambient air pollution could be associated with increased risk of sickle cell pain crises, epidemiologic research is very limited. The proposed study takes advantage of an existing statewide hospital administrative dataset; complex, innovative spatio-temporal particulate matter (PM) and component exposure models developed for previously funded research; hierarchical Bayesian ozone exposure models developed by the US EPA; and the case crossover study design. We will examine whether hospitalizations and emergency department visits for vaso-occlusive pain crises among SCD patients are associated with short-term exposures to ambient air pollutants. The proposed study will, to the best of our knowledge, be the first to evaluate comprehensively the effects of ozone, PM2.5, and biologically relevant traffic-related PM components on SCD vaso-occlusive pain crises among a statewide population with a high rate of reported SCD-related mortality. The results of our study could advance understanding of pathophysiological responses to air pollution among a population experiencing debilitating and costly adverse outcomes. Project Narrative Though it is biologically plausible that exposure to ambient air pollution could be associated with increased risk of sickle cell disease vaso-occlusive pain crises, research is extremely limited. We propose to use a statewide hospitalization dataset and spatio-temporal air pollution models to examine whether short-term air pollution exposures are associated with increased risks of sickle cell disease pain crises.",Relationship of Ambient Air Pollution Exposures with Vaso-Occlusive Pain Crises in Sickle Cell Disease,9755491,R21HL135545,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Hemolytic Anemia ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' sicklemia ', ' sickle disease ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' Asthma ', ' Bronchial Asthma ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Bone Marrow Transplantation ', ' Marrow Transplantation ', ' Bone Marrow Transplant ', ' Bone Marrow Grafting ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Carbon ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Methods Epidemiology ', ' Epidemiological Techniques ', ' Epidemiological Methods ', ' Epidemiologic Methods ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' blood disorder ', ' Hematological Disorder ', ' Hematologic Diseases ', ' Blood Diseases ', ' Hematological Disease ', ' Hemoglobinopathies ', ' inherited genetic disorder ', ' inherited genetic disease ', ' inherited diseases ', ' inborn error ', ' hereditary disorder ', ' Inherited disorder ', ' Inborn Genetic Diseases ', ' Hereditary Disease ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Ozone ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Suggestion ', ' Time ', ' Environmental Protection Agency ', ' United States Environmental Protection Agency ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Crossover Studies ', ' Cross-Over Studies ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle RBC ', ' Individual ', ' ozone exposure ', ' O3 exposure ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Policies ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Funding ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disease epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' Modality ', ' epidemiology study ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Reporting ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' vascular inflammation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Coagulation ', ' Clotting ', ' Coagulation Process ', ' Address ', ' Process ', ' Behavioral ', ' Particulate Matter ', ' cost ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' high risk ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' vaso-occlusive pain ', ' vasoocclusive pain ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' Emergency department visit ', ' Emergency room visit ', ' Emergency care visit ', ' ER visit ', ' ED visit ', ' ambient air pollution ', ' outdoor air pollution ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' clinical development ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIV OF MARYLAND, COLLEGE PARK",R21,2019,128753,0.325609302933972
"Psychological and brain mechanisms underlying disparities in opioid and non-opioid pain treatment decisions Project Summary Unequal prescribing of opioid and non-opioid analgesics among demographic groups contributes to two major health disparities in the United States. Overprescribing of opioid analgesics to treat both acute and chronic nonmalignant pain, especially in non-Hispanic whites, has fueled the opioid abuse epidemic. Underprescribing of opioid and non-opioid analgesics in minorities and women, even when their use is medically indicated (e.g., acute and cancer pain), reduces the effectiveness of pain management in these groups. In order to mitigate analgesic prescribing disparities and the associated risks of opioid abuse and poor pain management, we must understand the mechanisms underlying these disparities. The current project will test two potential contributors to these pain treatment disparities: 1) clinicians' inaccurate demographic stereotypes about pain sensitivity and tendency to abuse opioids (i.e., the stereotype hypothesis), and 2) reduced activation of clinicians' pain-related neural systems (e.g., anterior cingulate and anterior insula) in response to the pain of demographic outgroup patients (i.e., the vicarious pain hypothesis). Prior studies of mechanisms underlying analgesic prescribing disparities have been limited by the use of experimental paradigms that were low in ecological validity e.g. asking participants to make prescribing decisions based solely on text-based medical vignettes or depictions of individuals feigning pain. Additionally, although the robust fMRI literature on vicarious pain biases is related to biases in pain assessment, vicarious pain biases have not been tested as a potential contributor to biases pain treatment decisions. In the present proposal, these methodological limitations will be addressed and the stereotype and vicarious pain hypotheses will be tested through 3 specific aims. Aim 1 involves the design and production of a more ecologically valid video-based simulated pain assessment and treatment paradigm depicting individuals experiencing genuine pain. Aim 2 includes an fMRI study of the effects of clinicians' (medical students') vicarious pain responses and pain stereotypes on demographic biases in simulated pain assessment and analgesic prescribing, using the video paradigm created in Aim 1. Finally, to determine the clinical applicability of the findings from Aim 2, Aim 3 includes face-to-face pain assessments and treatment recommendations during simulated clinical interactions with standardized patient actors. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, these studies will yield new understanding of the relative contributions of pain-related stereotypes and vicarious pain to analgesic prescribing disparities. These results could indicate whether pain stereotype education, efforts to increase pain empathy, or both should be incorporated into clinician interventions aimed at reducing analgesic prescribing disparities. Through this K01 career development award, the candidate will gain facility in three areas not included in her past training: clinical pain assessment and treatment, multivariate statistical analysis, and behavioral medicine in order to more effectively understand psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms underlying health disparities in pain and pain management. Project Narrative The need for effective interventions to reduce overprescribing of opioids grows more urgent as the number of individuals affected by the opioid crisis continues to rise, and the need to improve pain management in minority populations becomes more critical as minority populations in the U.S. grow. The proposed research uses a novel combination of neurobiological (fMRI) and behavioral measures to investigate mechanisms underlying clinicians' gender and ethnic biases in opioid and non-opioid analgesic pain treatment decisions. The findings of this research can inform improvements in clinician training aimed as mitigating analgesic prescribing disparities and the associated risks of opioid abuse and poor pain management.",Psychological and brain mechanisms underlying disparities in opioid and non-opioid pain treatment decisions,9657002,K01DA045735,"['Affect ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Analgesics ', ' painkiller ', ' pain reliever ', ' pain medication ', ' pain killer ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Anodynes ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Cues ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' abuses drugs ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' Drug abuse ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Expression ', ' Face Pain ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Nationalities ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurobiology ', ' Neurosciences ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' opioid abuse ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Standardization ', ' Stereotyping ', ' medical school students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Opioid ', ' Opiates ', ' non-opioid analgesic ', ' nonopioid ', ' nonopiate analgesic ', ' non-opioid ', ' non-opiate analgesic ', ' non-narcotic analgesic ', ' Nonopioid Analgesics ', ' Nonnarcotic Analgesics ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional MRI ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' behavior measurement ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavioral measure ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social group ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Text ', ' digital ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' clinical application ', ' clinical applicability ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' effective therapy ', ' effective treatment ', ' prescription opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' opioid medication ', ' opiate medication ', ' licit opioid ', ' Pain intensity ', ' University resources ', ' ethnic bias ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opiate crisis ', ' patient screening ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' clinical pain ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,K01,2019,173453,0.49555743622115656
"iCanCope with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary Pain related to sickle cell disease (SCD) is most often treated in the home by patients and families, but this management is typically suboptimal. SCD mostly affects people of African descent. This population is known to suffer many racial and cultural inequities related to the medical management of SCD pain. Cognitive- behavioral therapies (CBT) that promote pain self-management can lead to symptom reduction, improved quality of life, and decreased healthcare use. However, most people with SCD do not receive CBT-based treatment due to barriers such as poor accessibility, limited availability of professionals, and high costs. Youth with SCD must assume more responsibility for managing their SCD pain, which typically becomes more chronic in adulthood. However, many youth never develop these important self-management skills during childhood and are poorly prepared to cope with SCD pain as adults. There is a critical need for innovative pain self-management programs that are accessible and tailored for youth with SCD pain. Access to web and mobile technologies among African Americans is high. In a qualitative study conducted by our group, youth with SCD, parents, and healthcare professionals indicated that these technologies could be applied to meet their pain self-management needs. Based on our team experiences in developing and testing web- and mobile- based pain management programs in other populations, we hypothesize that this approach will also be effective for delivering pain self-management to youth with SCD. In this application, our goal is to improve pain self-management and functioning in youth (aged 12-18) with SCD by developing and testing a tailored web and smartphone-based application (iCanCope with SCD). First, we plan to apply a user-centered design approach to refine and beta test the program. The program will include: (I) goal setting, (II) peer-based social support, and (III) pain self-management training. Second, we will determine program feasibility and initial program effectiveness through a pilot three-site randomized controlled trial. Preliminary effectiveness will be determined in 160 youth randomized to treatment compared to attention control. We hypothesize that youth who receive iCanCope with SCD will achieve greater reduction in pain intensity, pain-related disability and increased adaptive coping strategies (primary outcomes) as well as significant improvement in physical and emotional functioning and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up compared to youth who receive the attention-control condition. Third, we will explore moderators and mediators of treatment effect. This project represents a significant advance in delivering tailored psychological therapies for youth with SCD. Our long-term goal is to develop effective and flexible treatments that can be delivered at low cost to reduce SCD pain and disability, and better equip youth to cope with SCD as adults. Project Narrative Smartphone and Internet technologies can be leveraged to deliver engaging and flexible pain self- management therapies to adolescents with sickle cell disease and their caregivers. Our long-term goal is to develop effective and scalable treatments that can be delivered at low cost to reduce pain and disability, and better equip adolescents with strategies to cope with their

"Cooperative Pain Education and Self-management: Expanding Treatment for Real-World PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) is an evidence-based psychological intervention that is effective for reducing pain and improving function for patients with chronic pain. Numerous barriers exist to face-to-face delivery of this treatment, including patient travel limitations, the need for frequent in-person sessions, and the scarcity of trained therapists. Leveraging technology-based interventions, like interactive voice response (IVR), which allow patients to engage in treatment from their home, may improve access to CBT-CP. The overall goal of this project is to conduct a pragmatic trial to examine the real world effectiveness of an IVR-based form of CBT-CP called COoperative Pain Education and Self-management (COPES). In the spirit of pragmatic trials, our approach will minimize clinic disruption and avoid adding research staff in the field by using the VHA’s electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate recruitment and to collect data, all while delivering COPES from a centralized VA location. In preparation for the pragmatic trial, the initial study phase (UG3) will: a) identify facilities to participate in the trial from among the 60 Women’s Health Practice Based Network (WH-PBRN) sites, b) examine the adequacy of the EHR for providing outcome data, c) determine the feasibility of using EHR provider alerts to promote recruitment and d) secure all regulatory approvals along with support from leadership at selected sites. Phase two (UH3) will then compare outcomes among Veterans randomized to either: 1) COPES, a 10-week IVR-based CBT and walking program plus any provider prescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain treatments (COPES+UC), or 2) in-person CBT-CP provided by clinicians, previously trained through VHA’s evidence based psychotherapy program plus any provider prescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (VHA CBT-CP+UC). Patients will be compared on a composite measure of pain intensity and functioning, EHR pain intensity, and health care use including emergency department, urgent care, and specialty pain services along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain interventions. Uptake and variation in outcomes across groups will also be evaluated where treatment disparities are possible (e.g. by sex, race, mental health comorbidities). Additionally, the cost of the COPES intervention will be examined, including intervention delivery expenditures and budget impact analysis. Finally, evaluation of the intervention process will be informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). CFIR-guided interviews with study site clinicians and administrators will assess experiences with the COPES and CBT-CP interventions and implementation findings will be communicated with participating sites and stakeholders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) is an evidence-based intervention that is effective in reducing pain and improving function for Veterans with chronic pain, yet numerous barriers exist to widespread implementation of traditional CBT-CP, including patient travel limitations, the need for frequent in-person sessions, and the scarcity of trained therapists. Because technology-based interventions, like interactive voice response (IVR), allow patients to engage in treatment from their home, they may improve access to CBT-CP. The aim of the current project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of IVR-delivered CBT-CP compared to in-person CBT-CP in VHA settings.",Cooperative Pain Education and Self-management: Expanding Treatment for Real-World,9949285,UH3AT009767,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Pain management ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' Pain Control ', ' Budgets ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Expenditure ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' male ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' Persons ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Travel ', ' Veterans ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' health administration ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical study ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical study ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical study ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-center clinical study ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' Emergency Care ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' ER care ', ' ED care ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' health practice ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Network-based ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' routine care ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' Secure ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' IRBs ', ' IRB ', ' Pain intensity ', ' urgent care ', ' trial design ', ' treatment group ', ' formative assessment ', ' formative evaluation ', ' walking program ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' efficacy study ', ' recruit ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' patient barriers ', ' pain reduction ', ' reduce pain ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' primary endpoint ', ' primary end point ', ' ']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2019,1251381,0.42896036312749714
"Estradiol and Zoster Associated Orofacial Pain ABSTRACT People with herpes zoster (HZ) or “shingles” can suffer from orofacial pain. Orofacial HZ is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the trigeminal ganglia. Importantly, women report HZ pain three times more often than men, but the mechanism for this sex disparity is unknown. A screen by our lab of over 20,000 genes in five different regions of the orofacial pain pathway revealed that the greatest change in gene expression occurred in the thalamus, such that glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) were elevated at proestrus (high 17 β-estradiol, E2) but not diestrus (low E2). In preliminary studies we showed that female rats have a greater VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response in comparison to males; mirroring the human sex difference. We also showed that reducing E2 production in male and female rats increases their nociceptive response and lastly, knock-down of VGAT expression in the thalamus increased the nociceptive response. Based on these studies we hypothesized that E2 attenuates orofacial nociception by increasing GAD2 or VGAT, enhancing GABAergic neural inhibition within the thalamus to reduce pain. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will characterize thalamic control of the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. The working hypothesis for Aim 1 is that GABA interneurons inhibit neurons in the thalamus to reduce VZV induced nociception. To test this hypothesis first, VZV induced nociception and neuronal activity will be recorded after attenuating inhibitory interneurons. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be determined after modulating GAD2 and VGAT expression in these interneurons. Aim 2 will determine the role of sex steroids in modulating the VZV induced nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 will increase expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus causing attenuation of neuronal activity and the nociceptive response. To test this hypothesis first, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be measured in female and male rats after administering E2 or reducing E2 production. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be measured after knock-down of GAD2 and VGAT expression in rats with varied E2 levels. Aim 3 will characterize the mechanism by which sex steroids modulate VGAT and GAD2 to affect the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 binds to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) causing increased expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus resulting in attenuation of nociception. To test this idea, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be quantitated in rats after mutating ERα promoter sites using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. From these three aims we expect to determine 1) that GABA interneurons inhibit thalamic signaling to reduce orofacial pain, 2) that GAD2 and VGAT increases in these neurons through an ERα dependent mechanism, and 3) that GAD2 and VGAT are responsible, in part, for the sex difference observed in HZ pain. Identifying a mechanism by which E2 affects HZ-associated pain will provide new targets for treating people suffering from this chronic disorder. Project Narrative These studies will evaluate the role of two neuron inhibitory genes, glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). Thalamic expression of these two genes was regulated by estrogen and the role of these genes in the underlying molecular pathogenesis of Zoster associated nociception will be evaluated in this application. These experiments will provide valuable insights into an area of Herpes Zoster pain biology and pathology that are poorly understood and highly prioritized by the NIDCR. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel genes by which 17β-estradiol affects orofacial hypersensitivity will be identified, providing a greater understanding of why females suffer greater pain and allow for targeted control of their expression to reduce orofacial pain.",Estradiol and Zoster Associated Orofacial Pain,10021211,R01DE026749,"['Affect ', ' Aromatase ', ' Subfamily XIX Cytochrome P450 ', '

"Identifying Opportunities to Improve Hydroxyurea Therapy Initiation and Adherence among Children with Sickle Cell Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY Approximately 1 in 500 African American births are diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD), which is associated with substantial morbidity and risk of early mortality. Among affected individuals, sickling of the red blood cells causes excruciating, chronic pain, which is the most common symptom of SCD. The presence of pain indicates suboptimal disease management and results in substantial financial burden on the healthcare system. Over 50% of children with SCD have at least one pain crisis a year; these pain crises are associated with substantially lower quality of life, as well as inadequate sleep, more school absences, chronic depression, and impaired peer relationships. The frequency, intensity, and duration of pain crises can only be controlled through appropriate disease management using the medication hydroxyurea. Use of hydroxyurea therapy by children with SCD is associated with lower rates of initial and recurrent episodes of pain, hand-foot syndrome (dactylitis), acute chest syndrome, and hospitalization compared with no hydroxyurea therapy. Given the substantial potential of hydroxyurea therapy to reduce pain crises and other clinical complications among children with SCD, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released (2014) recommendations for its use among children. All children (9 months or older) with specific subtypes of SCD should be offered hydroxyurea therapy to reduce its health-related complications, irrespective of disease severity. The existing body of evidence regarding the use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD is based on studies conducted prior to the NHLBI recommendation for use among all children. Consequently, there is a complete gap in knowledge regarding use of hydroxyurea therapy post NHLBI recommendations. Using administrative claims from states with the highest prevalence of SCD, complemented by focus groups with key stakeholders, this research project will identify multiple levels of opportunities for improvement in appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD. In addition, this project provides the framework to enable me to become a successful independent investigator and a leader in reducing health disparities among children with severe chronic conditions through development of expertise in comparative effectiveness, qualitative methods, and medication adherence theory. Combined, these research and training activities will provide a crucial foundation for a subsequent application to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to gauge the effectiveness of interventions targeted at SCD patients, their caregivers, and providers of SCD services to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among this vulnerable population. To this end, the following aims will be investigated: Research Aim 1: Quantify hydroxyurea therapy prevalence prior to NHLBI guidelines, and changes in prevalence post-NHLBI guidelines among children with SCD using Medicaid administrative claims data, as well as predictors of hydroxyurea initiation and adherence.  Specific Aim 1a: Assess baseline hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD prior to NHLBI guidelines (2005-2012). Specific Aim 1b: Evaluate changes in hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD post- NHLBI guidelines (2011-2017). Specific Aim 1c: Identify characteristics associated with hydroxyurea initiation and subsequent adherence among children with SCD. Research Aim 2: Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of hydroxyurea therapy among adherent users on reducing the incidence of pain crises, adverse outcomes, and use of health services, compared with those having limited or no use of hydroxyurea therapy. Research Aim 3: Identify barriers to initiation and adherence of hydroxyurea therapy through focus groups conducted among adolescents with SCD, caregivers of children with SCD, and SCD health services providers in Michigan. Overall Career Development Aim: To acquire the skills and experience necessary to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy in children with SCD. These aims will be achieved during 3 phases of research over 5 years under the guidance of a multi- disciplinary team of experienced mentors. Through the conduct of high quality research, formal coursework, and interaction with mentors, this K01 award will provide the PI with the necessary training to become a successful independent investigator and to develop a future R01 grant application. If successful, this line of inquiry will improve health outcomes and quality of life among children with SCD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Severe pain episodes are the most common, debilitating, and costly morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Use of hydroxyurea is the only method to prevent these pain crises among children, and interventions to increase its use are urgently needed.

"Neural mechanisms underlying psychosocial contributions to ethnic group differences in pain Considerable evidence demonstrates that pain disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, especially African Americans (AAs), who experience frequent, severe and disabling chronic pain compared to their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts. These racial and ethnic disparities extend to many chronic pain conditions, but are perhaps best documented in people with osteoarthritis (OA). Previous research revealed that AAs with OA experience more frequent and severe clinical pain and disability and show a quantitative sensory testing profile suggesting impaired pain inhibition and enhanced generalized pain facilitation compared to NHWs. In addition, previous findings demonstrated higher pain catastrophizing (a tendency to negatively evaluate one's ability to cope with pain and to respond to anticipated or actual pain in a heightened negative cognitive and emotional manner) among AAs compared to NHWs. While multiple factors inevitably contribute, cognitive and affective processes and ethnic group differences in central pain processing represent potentially important determinants of greater clinical pain among African Americans. Despite its pervasive negative effects, no neuroimaging study to date has experimentally manipulated pain catastrophizing and measured cerebral activity during experimentally-induced pain to determine the neural mechanisms whereby catastrophizing impacts pain responses. Moreover, the extent to which the influence of pain catastrophizing on these central pathways contributes to ethnic group differences in the experience of pain remains unexplored. Therefore, the overall goal for this mentored career development proposal (K22) is to elucidate the neural mechanism involved in pain catastrophizing and its influence on pain processing in different ethnic groups. Primary training goals for the current proposal are to: 1) develop a comprehensive knowledge base in neuroimaging techniques, methodological designs, data acquisition, data analyses, and interpretation of findings; 2) expand knowledge of advanced pain assessment skills including quantitative sensory testing and clinical models of pain; 3) Obtain expertise in principles of experimental design and statistical methodology utilized for biomedical research, including neuroimaging studies; and 4) enhance translational research skills to function as an independent investigator. Study 1 (Phase I) will determine whether pain catastrophizing contributes to ethnic group differences in pain-related brain function, clinical pain, and pain sensitivity among AAs and NHWs with knee OA. Study 2 (Phase II) will characterize the impact of an anti-catastrophizing manipulation on central pain processes and pain among AAs and NHWs with knee OA. The proposed career development plan extends from the PI's prior work on pain catastrophizing and mechanisms of pain processing, and will also provide the neuroimaging training and expertise to propel a promising young investigator at the intersection of pain and neuroscience research. Chronic pain is a significant public health problem and is associated with increased economic, functional, and psychological burden. While pain affects all segments of the population, racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., particularly African Americans, experience more frequent, severe and disabling chronic pain compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. While multiple factors inevitably contribute, cognitive and affective processes and ethnic group differences in central pain processing represent potentially important determinants of greater clinical pain among African Americans. The proposed work will elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the influence of catastrophizing on pain response in different ethnic groups. Findings will have strong implications for advancement of the understanding of pain catastrophizing and its influence on pain in different ethnic groups.",Neural mechanisms underlying psychosocial contributions to ethnic group differences in pain,9652841,K22NS102334,"['Affect ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Encephalon ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Control Groups ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Economics ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' frontal cortex ', ' frontal lobe ', ' Goals ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Insula ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Public Health ', ' Reflex ', ' Reflex action ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' physical handicap ', ' physical disability ', ' Physically Disabled ', ' Physically Handicapped ', ' chronic pain ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' Brain imaging ', ' brain visualization ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' psychologic ', ' psychological ', ' Training ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' disability ', ' Nociception ', ' nociceptive ', ' central pain ', ' cortical pain ', ' Individual ', ' Cerebrum ', ' cerebral ', ' Development Plans ', ' Knowledge ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee OA ', ' Severities ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Spinal ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' neural ', ' skills ', ' neuroimaging ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Brain region ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Pain Research ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Process ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' Chronic disabling pain ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' neuromechanism ', ' neural mechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' data acquisition ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' Affective ', ' pain inhibition ', ' inhibit pain ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' racial minority ', ' imaging study ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' pain model ', ' pain processing ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' pain reduction ', ' reduce pain ', ' clinical pain ', ' osteoarthritis pain ', ' pain catastrophizing ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K22,2019,95796,0.5002057091274434
"Using Technology to Deliver Evidence-Based Interventions for Pain to Patients with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this candidate's program of research is to improve behavioral and physical health and reduce health disparities by using multimedia technology to deliver evidence-based interventions to underserved populations. The focus is sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition that disproportionately affects those of African descent. Many people living with SCD suffer from daily chronic pain as well as recurrent acute pain episodes that require medical attention. Opioid medication is the primary treatment for pain in SCD, despite its limited effectiveness and negative side-effects. The proposed K23 attempts to address the need for an alternative, non-pharmacological pain treatment in SCD. Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) has been found effective for reducing chronic pain and may be a low cost, easily accessible and scalable pain treatment in SCD. The candidate's K12 project tested a cCBT program for anxiety and depression; preliminary results suggest that patients liked using the program, but found that much of its content did not relate to their lives. To address this limitation, the proposed K23 project will adapt an existing cCBT program for pain management to create ReThink Pain SCD, a culturally-tailored, mobile-phone delivered behavioral intervention designed specifically to help African American patients self-manage chronic sickle cell pain. Aim 1: Modify and tailor the generic cCBT pain program, using qualitative research methods to understand the needs and barriers to pain management in patients with SCD, as well as the opportunities to engage this population using multimedia. These data will inform the development of the features and content of ReThink Pain SCD. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot pragmatic clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing this pain intervention into routine SCD care. Forty patients with SCD will be randomized to either receive 8 sessions of the cCBT program or 8 online education modules on a smartphone. Primary outcomes of the trial include feasibility (recruitment, retention, provider and patient feedback) and acceptability (sessions completed) of the ReThink Pain SCD program. In order to achieve the goals of this research plan and transition to independence, the candidate requires further training in user-centered design, implementation science, design and conduct of pragmatic clinical trials, and team management and leadership. This proposal includes an exceptional team of mentors and consultants. Primary mentor Dr. Bruce Rollman is founding Director of the Center for Behavioral Health and Smart Technology.

"Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PTSD and chronic pain are highly prevalent and each is associated with long-term disability and substance abuse, exacting enormous emotional, functional, and financial tolls on individuals and society. PTSD and chronic pain are frequently co-morbid with overlap between 20% and 70%, representing an enormous public health problem. However, our understanding of the mechanisms by which PTSD and chronic pain become intertwined is limited. The majority of studies of the PTSD/chronic pain co-morbidity are cross- sectional, and focused on a single chronic pain condition, limiting causal inferences and generalizability to other chronic pain conditions. Chronic pain is also related to a high prevalence of substance abuse. To understand how trauma-related PTSD, and resilience and vulnerability factors contribute to the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse requires prospective designs. Such research is vital among inner-city African American women, who are more likely to experience traumatic stress and pain, but are less likely to be treated appropriately; a phenomenon perhaps leading to greater risk for disability and substance abuse. We propose to examine 3 models related to the development of PTSD/chronic pain pairing and development of substance abuse in people initially presenting with acute pain (not caused by a traumatic event) in a 6-month prospective design. First is the Main Effects Model in which the level of PTSD symptoms at baseline will predict the likelihood of a transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse at 6 months. Second is the Moderation Model in which baseline vulnerability and resilience factors interact with PTSD symptoms to predict the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later. Third is the Mediator Model in which relationships between baseline levels of PTSD symptoms and the development of chronic pain and substance abuse 6 months later are mediated by vulnerability and resilience factors at 3 months. Inner-city women (N=600) presenting to an Emergency Department with a complaint of acute bodily pain, ages 18-40 yrs, will be recruited. Only women presenting with acute pelvic/abdominal, neck/shoulder or low back pain, and who do not have a chronic pain history will be enrolled. We will assess trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, pain sensitivity, substance dependence and abuse, acute pain and psychosocial resilience and vulnerability factors across 3 waves (baseline, 3- and 6-months), and obtain additional phone assessment of pain intensity and interference at 1-, 2-, 4-, and 5-months. Inner-city women were chosen because of their high likelihood of exposure to ongoing traumatic events and the opportunity to illuminate a health disparity involving the PTSD/chronic pain pairing among inner-city minority women in particular. The public health problem posed by co-morbid PTSD, chronic pain and substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of transitioning from acute to chronic pain and developing substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: PTSD and chronic pain frequently co-occur with 20-70% of people with chronic pain conditions reporting trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms. The public health problem posed by co-occurring PTSD, chronic pain and concomitant substance abuse cannot be overstated, particularly as it impacts health disparities in the US. Results from this prospective study of how PTSD influences the transition from acute to chronic pain and development of substance abuse will shed light on this well-documented but poorly understood co-morbidity. Greater understanding of how PTSD may increase the likelihood of developing chronic pain and substance abuse, which factors contribute to these developments, and which people may be most vulnerable will allow more timely clinical interventions on accurately identified targets to help forestall the development of these largely intractable conditions.",Development of Co-Morbid PTSD and Chronic Pain Among Inner-City Women,9700094,R01DA039522,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Comorbidity ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Lumbago ', ' Low Backache ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Neck ', ' Painful ', ' Pain ', ' pain assay ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Pelvic Region ', ' Pelvic ', ' Pelvis ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Shoulder ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' Substance Dependence ', ' Substance Addiction ', ' Phone ', ' Telephone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' therapy selection ', ' Selection for Treatments ', ' chronic pain ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Exposure to ', ' psychosocial ', ' inner city ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Emergency Department ', ' experience ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Reporting ', ' Substance abuse problem ', ' substance abuse ', ' abuse of substances ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Symptoms ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' public health relevance ', ' Pain interference ', ' Pain intensity ', ' traumatic event ', ' Assessment tool ', ' Assessment instrument ', ' recruit ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' trauma exposure ', ' exposure to trauma ', ' ']",NIDA,RUSH UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2019,572818,0.334506989553484
"University of Florida Resource Center for Minority Aging Research PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain conditions represent arguably the most prevalent and costly public health problem in the United States, and they are the leading cause of disability worldwide. While pain affects individuals throughout the lifespan, older adults are disproportionately impacted and are at particularly increased risk for chronic pain and pain-related disability. Surprisingly, knowledge regarding the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying age- related increases in pain remains quite limited, therefore, increased research is needed to elucidate social and behavioral contributions to pain and disability among older adults. A critical barrier to progress in this area of research is the limited availability of investigators with appropriate interdisciplinary training in addressing later life pain and disability. With strong institutional support, the University of Florida (UF) Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) will be established to address these scientific and workforce development needs. The UF RCMAR has an educational objective to provide outstanding training and career development opportunities to promising investigators from underrepresented backgrounds. The UF RCMAR's research objective is to conduct innovative and impactful transdisciplinary social and behavioral research addressing pain and disability among older adults, including health disparities in later life pain and disability (e.g. racial and ethnic differences, sex and gender differences, and socioeconomic influences). The UF RCMAR will accomplish these objectives through the synergistic efforts of four Cores: an Administrative Core (AC), a Research Education Component (REC), an Analysis Core (AnC), and a Community Liaison and Recruitment Core (CLRC). In addition, the UF RCMAR will benefit from extensive collaborations with other UF entities, including The UF Pain Research & Intervention Center of Excellence (PRICE), the UF Institute on Aging (IOA), and the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The UF RCMAR boasts an outstanding interdisciplinary group of Core Faculty with expertise spanning the spectrum of clinical and translational research related to our theme of biopsychosocial contributions to pain and disability among older adults. In order to accomplish its objectives, the UF RCMAR will recruit and retain outstanding early stage investigators from unrepresented backgrounds and provide them with excellent mentoring and career development support. Through its research activities, the UF RCMAR will produce novel and important information regarding social and behavioral contributors to pain and disability in older adults, and will develop and test innovative interventions to reduce later life pain and disability.

"Evidence-based Approaches to Chronic Pain Management in Youth with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain is a complex and challenging problem associated with significant disability and suffering among children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD). There is a gap in scientific knowledge in understanding the progression of chronic SCD pain that hinders the development of effective therapeutic options. Psychological treatments are key components of comprehensive chronic pain management, but currently have limited efficacy for managing SCD pain in youth. Thus, the long-term career goal of this candidate is to become an independent clinical investigator with expertise in SCD pain to establish a novel stepped care model of delivering behavioral interventions for SCD pain management that are easily implemented in real-world clinical settings. She will begin to achieve these goals by obtaining clinical and research training in SCD pain physiology and pharmacology and training in implementation science, health disparities research, and advanced quantitative and qualitative methods to support a patient-centered approach to pain intervention development, optimization, and evaluation. Her career development plan is uniquely tailored to fulfill gaps in her training in pediatric pain under the mentorship of national and international leaders at Emory University and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta. The training plan leverages the well- supported infrastructure of the largest pediatric sickle cell program in the US as well as national and institutional opportunities to ensure didactic, experiential, and specialized individual instruction. The research objectives of this application are to first rigorously characterize trajectories of chronic pain over a 24-month period in a cohort of youth with SCD (ages 10-18 years). Data will help identify modifiable psychosocial and family risk factors (e.g., elevated anxiety or depressive symptoms, caregiver stress) that predict different chronic pain trajectories to inform relevant behavioral treatment targets in a family-focused cognitive-behavioral intervention. Standard qualitative and mixed-method approaches and iterative design using focus groups, key informant interviews, and community stakeholders will be used to develop and refine intervention content and format and solicit feedback to enhance the success of future implementation in clinical settings. The result will be a family-focused, culturally informed, evidence-based intervention termed Back2Living (“Building Adaptive Coping and Knowledge To improve daily Living”) that is amenable for implementation in real-world clinical settings. A pilot proof-of-concept trial will evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of Back2Living with youth with chronic SCD pain and their parents. An adaptive treatment approach with 4-8 treatment sessions selected on the basis of baseline assessment will target comorbid psychosocial risk factors and allow flexibility in tailoring treatment components to meet individual family needs to reduce pain interference, pain, and healthcare use. Results of this proposal may ultimately contribute to novel comprehensive treatment approaches to treat chronic pain in pediatric SCD and improve quality of life. PROJECT NARRATIVE Although chronic pain is a significant problem that contributes to poor quality of life in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about the individual and family psychosocial factors that contribute to chronic SCD pain, which severely hinders the development of effective treatment options. This research will characterize the natural course of chronic SCD pain and determine psychosocial risk factors that impact chronic pain in youth with SCD to inform the development of an adaptive family-focused behavioral intervention that is tailored to meet individual family needs to reduce pain-related disability. The long-term goal of this research is to develop a psychosocial risk stratification to inform comprehensive treatment approaches for SCD pain management and prevention.",Evidence-based Approaches to

"The Role of Opioid Adherence Profiles in Cancer Pain Self-Management and Outcomes ABSTRACT/ PROJECT SUMMARY  Pain is one of the top symptoms producing the greatest negative impact on cancer patients' quality of life. Unfortunately, one in three cancer patients will experience moderate to severe pain due to consequences of cancer, its treatments or both. For one in three, pain will persist after completion of active cancer treatments. With 15.5 million Americans living with cancer, this is a substantial public health matter. While many complementary and alternative medicine approaches exist, their clinical use for cancer pain remains seriously hampered by lack of robust evidence, short-term relief, and excessive out-of-pocket costs. In turn, opioid pain medications are prescribed to cancer patients – who notably, also remain excluded from most state and policy initiatives on opioids. Long-term (>3 months ) opioid therapy is also prevalent among cancer outpatients when compared to age-sex matched controls. Despite this, cancer patients have been almost invariably excluded from T he recent Health management” studies investigating the outcomes of long-term opioid therapy and use. and Human   Services Pain Management Inter-Agency Taskforce has identified “self- as one of the best practices in improving chronic pain. However,interventions cannot be designed due to serious gaps in our current understanding of cancer outpatients' pain self-management and especially their opioid self-management. Recent systematic reviews demonstrate that most cancer pain interventions (based on knowledge translation and conducted predominantly or exclusively with White patients) improve knowledge, but largely do not improve outcomes that matter to patients such as daily pain, function, or quality of life. This underscores a need to continue in search of other targets for intervention development. This 6-month prospective cohort study will generate new knowledge about longitudinal pain, opioid self- management trajectories, and associated outcomes among cancer outpatients in the context of daily pain, pain flares, key clinical moderators and covariates. A total of 400 cancer outpatients (50% African Americans; 50% women) who are prescribed long-acting (LA) opioids will be recruited from three urban oncology centers. Longitudinal opioid self-management patterns will be captured in real-time using medication event monitoring system (MEMS®). Daily background pain, pain flares, and use of “as-needed” opioids will be collected using the self-report tracker (SRT®). Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) to be assessed are changes in pain levels, function, sleep, and health-related quality of life. Health services outcomes include unplanned hospitalizations and emergency department use (healthcare utilization). This study will supply rigorous data, comprehensive set of sociodemographic and clinical covariates, and key moderators upon which further research for pain-self management best practices can be based, including targets to ameliorate racial disparities. Overall, this research can have a sustained impact on the science of cancer pain management.

"Neural mechanisms underlying psychosocial contributions to ethnic group differences in pain Considerable evidence demonstrates that pain disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities in the United States, especially African Americans (AAs), who experience frequent, severe and disabling chronic pain compared to their non-Hispanic white (NHW) counterparts. These racial and ethnic disparities extend to many chronic pain conditions, but are perhaps best documented in people with osteoarthritis (OA). Previous research revealed that AAs with OA experience more frequent and severe clinical pain and disability and show a quantitative sensory testing profile suggesting impaired pain inhibition and enhanced generalized pain facilitation compared to NHWs. In addition, previous findings demonstrated higher pain catastrophizing (a tendency to negatively evaluate one's ability to cope with pain and to respond to anticipated or actual pain in a heightened negative cognitive and emotional manner) among AAs compared to NHWs. While multiple factors inevitably contribute, cognitive and affective processes and ethnic group differences in central pain processing represent potentially important determinants of greater clinical pain among African Americans. Despite its pervasive negative effects, no neuroimaging study to date has experimentally manipulated pain catastrophizing and measured cerebral activity during experimentally-induced pain to determine the neural mechanisms whereby catastrophizing impacts pain responses. Moreover, the extent to which the influence of pain catastrophizing on these central pathways contributes to ethnic group differences in the experience of pain remains unexplored. Therefore, the overall goal for this mentored career development proposal (K22) is to elucidate the neural mechanism involved in pain catastrophizing and its influence on pain processing in different ethnic groups. Primary training goals for the current proposal are to: 1) develop a comprehensive knowledge base in neuroimaging techniques, methodological designs, data acquisition, data analyses, and interpretation of findings; 2) expand knowledge of advanced pain assessment skills including quantitative sensory testing and clinical models of pain; 3) Obtain expertise in principles of experimental design and statistical methodology utilized for biomedical research, including neuroimaging studies; and 4) enhance translational research skills to function as an independent investigator. Study 1 (Phase I) will determine whether pain catastrophizing contributes to ethnic group differences in pain-related brain function, clinical pain, and pain sensitivity among AAs and NHWs with knee OA. Study 2 (Phase II) will characterize the impact of an anti-catastrophizing manipulation on central pain processes and pain among AAs and NHWs with knee OA. The proposed career development plan extends from the PI's prior work on pain catastrophizing and mechanisms of pain processing, and will also provide the neuroimaging training and expertise to propel a promising young investigator at the intersection of pain and neuroscience research. Chronic pain is a significant public health problem and is associated with increased economic, functional, and psychological burden. While pain affects all segments of the population, racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S., particularly African Americans, experience more frequent, severe and disabling chronic pain compared to their non-Hispanic white counterparts. While multiple factors inevitably contribute, cognitive and affective processes and ethnic group differences in central pain processing represent potentially important determinants of greater clinical pain among African Americans. The proposed work will elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the influence of catastrophizing on pain response in different ethnic groups. Findings will have strong implications for advancement of the understanding of pain catastrophizing and its influence on pain in different ethnic groups.",Neural mechanisms underlying psychosocial contributions to ethnic group differences in pain,10107116,K22NS102334,"['Affect ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' Control Groups ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' frontal lobe ', ' frontal cortex ', ' Goals ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Mentors ', ' Methodology ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' pain assay ', ' Public Health ', ' Reflex action ', ' Reflex ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Rest ', ' Somatosensory Cortex ', ' somesthetic sensory cortex ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' chronic pain ', ' Prefrontal Cortex ', ' brain visualization ', ' Brain imaging ', ' Anterior ', ' Medial ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Training ', ' Mesencephalic Central Gray ', ' Midbrain Central Gray ', ' Periaqueductal Gray ', ' annulus of the aqueduct ', ' periaqueductal gray matter ', ' midbrain central gray substance ', ' disability ', ' nociceptive ', ' Nociception ', ' cortical pain ', ' central pain ', ' Individual ', ' cerebral ', ' Cerebrum ', ' Development Plans ', ' Knowledge ', ' knee OA ', ' knee joint OA ', ' knee joint osteoarthritis ', ' Knee Osteoarthritis ', ' Severities ', ' Sensory ', ' Techniques ', ' Spinal ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' cingulate cortex ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' neuro-imaging ', ' neuroimaging ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Emotional ', ' career development ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Brain region ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' Neurosciences Research ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Pain Research ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Chronic disabling pain ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' neural mechanism ', ' neuromechanism ', ' Impairment ', ' data acquisition ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Affective ', ' inhibit pain ', ' pain inhibition ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' racial minority ', ' imaging study ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' pain model ', ' pain processing ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' clinical pain ', ' osteoarthritis associated pain ', ' osteoarthritis pain ', ' pain catastrophizing ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA,K22,2020,222108,0.5002057091274434
"A Mobile Health Behavioral Pain Intervention Protocol for Breast Cancer Patients with Pain in Medically Underserved Communities: A Randomized Controlled Trial The efficacy of a mobile health (mHealth) behavioral cancer pain intervention designed to decrease pain and disability for breast cancer patients in medically underserved areas has not been investigated. The long-term goal of this work is to use mHealth technologies to facilitate wide-spread implementation of an efficacious behavioral cancer pain intervention – a non-pharmacological approach to pain management. The proposed project’s objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of an innovative mobile health Pain Coping Skills Training (mPCST-Community) designed to meet the needs of breast cancer patients with pain in medically underserved areas. mPCST-Community addresses intervention barriers for patients in medically underserved areas as it is delivered with video-conferencing in the patients’ community based oncology clinic by a remote therapist, is extended to the patients’ home environment using simple mHealth technology, and is low-literacy adapted. The central hypothesis is that mPCST-Community will result in decreased pain compared to a mHealth education attention control group (mHealth-Ed). The rationale of this proposal is that if mPCST-Community is shown to be efficacious it will rapidly increase intervention access for individuals who receive their oncology care in medically underserved areas and ultimately reduce pain-related suffering. Guided by strong preliminary data, a randomized controlled trial will be used to pursue three specific aims: 1) Test the extent to which the mPCST-Community intervention reduces pain, fatigue, disability, and distress, 2) Examine self-efficacy and pain catastrophizing as mediators through which the mPCST-Community leads to reductions in pain, fatigue, disability, and distress, and 3) To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mPCST-Community. For Aim 1, based on the study team’s extensive work demonstrating the efficacy of in-person pain coping skills training protocols and pilot work showing promise for mPCST-Community, it is expected that mPCST-Community will lead to decreased pain as well as fatigue, disability, and distress compared to mHealth-Ed. For Aim 2, it is expected that the effects of mPCST-Community will be mediated by increased self-efficacy for pain control and decreased pain catastrophizing. For Aim 3, it is expected that mPCST-Community will demonstrate cost-effectiveness as assessed by all-cause medical resource use, participant and therapist time, and health utilities as well as successful overall accrual, high subject retention, and high intervention adherence. This innovative application proposes the first study to examine the efficacy of mPCST-Community that is designed to address pain in cancer patients in medically underserved areas. While improving access to care is critical, providing efficacious care is just as important. If mPCST- Community is shown to be efficacious, it will provide an intervention that can be rapidly implemented into the care of cancer patients with pain. Importantly, if efficacious this intervention could provide a needed model for non-pharmacological approaches to pain management for other populations of patients with chronic pain. Relevance This research is relevant to public health because it aims to improve quality of life in the many US patients with cancer who live in medically underserved areas with a non-pharmacological approach to pain management. This innovative work will demonstrate the efficacy of a behavioral cancer pain intervention delivered by mHealth technology (i.e., video- conferencing with a remote therapist in the patients community based oncology clinic and home-extension with a basic smartphone) to decrease pain and disability; demonstration of efficacy has a high potential to lead to rapid wide-spread use, particularly benefiting individuals who face significant barriers (e.g., access, distance, financial, time, low literacy) to traditional behavioral interventions. The project is relevant to NIH’s mission because it aims to use a non-pharmacological approach reduce pain that incurs burden and disability and increase quality of life in patients with cancer.",A Mobile Health Behavioral Pain Intervention Protocol for Breast Cancer Patients with Pain in Medically Underserved Communities: A Randomized Controlled Trial,9886379,R01CA237892,"['Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Arthritis ', ' arthritic ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' Control Groups ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Incidence ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' literacy ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' Mission ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Relaxation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Transportation ', ' Travel ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Years ', ' QALY ', ' Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy ', ' Cost Savings ', ' Coping Skills ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' physical disability ', ' physically disabled ', ' physically handicapped ', ' Rural Community ', ' Caring ', ' Magazine ', ' Journals ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Medical ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' Oncology ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' psychosocial ', ' skills training ', ' Medical center ', ' cancer pain ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' Health Care Technology ', ' Healthcare Technology ', ' Health Technology ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' behavioral health ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer care ', ' Cell Phone ', ' Cellular Telephone ', ' iPhone ', ' smart phone ', ' smartphone ', ' Cellular Phone ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Videoconferencing ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Ph.D. ', ' PhD ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Improve Access ', ' Cancer Patient ', ' Text ', ' manage symptom ', ' symptom management ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' constant pain ', ' lasting pain ', ' on-going pain ', ' ongoing pain ', ' Persistent pain ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' medically underserved ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' patient population ', ' primary outcome ', ' efficacy testing ', ' arm ', ' Pain interference ', ' m-Health ', ' mobile health ', ' mHealth ', ' mobile app ', ' mobile application ', ' behavioral health intervention ', ' attentional control ', ' Breast Tumor Patient ', ' Breast Cancer Patient ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' evaluate cost-effectiveness ', ' cost-effectiveness evaluation ', ' recruit ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' pain outcome ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' pain catastrophizing ', ' community clinic ', ' ']",NCI,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,633405,0.4244496663847517
"Nonpharmacologic Pain Management in FQHC primary care clinics PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain is a ubiquitous problem and growing concern for society, contributing substantially to the ongoing opioid epidemic. Back pain is the most common chronic pain diagnosis and the most common diagnosis for which opioids are prescribed. Clinical practice guidelines and opioid-prescribing recommendations make it clear that nonpharmacologic pain treatments are preferable to opioids for patients with back pain. Despite unequivocal evidence, over-prescribing of opioids to individuals with back pain persists. Primary care providers serving rural and low income communities face specific challenges to providing nonpharmacologic pain care instead of over-reliance on opioids. Providers of nonpharmacologic care are often absent from these communities and even if present may be inaccessible to patients with limited financial resources. Many rural and low income communities are served by federally-qualified health centers (FQHCs). FQHCs often serve communities at the forefront of the opioid crisis but too often lack options to provide accessible nonpharmacologic alternatives to the patients they serve. This Project describes a 1-year planning phase followed by a 4-year clinical trial that will compare the effectiveness of different strategies to provide efficacious nonpharmacologic interventions to patients with back pain seeking care in FQHCs throughout the state of Utah. The strategies evaluated are designed to overcome the barriers specific to rural and low income communities served by FQHC clinics through innovative use of telehealth resources. The randomized clinical trial will evaluate two interventions strategies, one providing both a brief pain teleconsult with phone-based physical therapy, the other uses an adaptive strategy – providing the brief pain teleconsult first, followed by phone-based physical therapy among those non-responsive to this treatment. We will also evaluate outcomes related to the efforts to implement strategies in FQHC clinics in order to provide valuable information for future efforts to scale effective strategies into other low resource health care settings. Our clinical trial has 4 Specific Aims: 1) compare the effectiveness of a pain teleconsult intervention with or without phone-based physical therapy for patients with chronic back pain in FQHCs, 2) compare the effectiveness of different 2-phase treatment strategies in which phone-based physical therapy is considered either a first-line or second-line option, 3) examine the results for Aims 1 & 2 in pre-specified sub- groups of patients based on baseline characteristics, and 4) examine implementation outcomes of the pain teleconsult including acceptability, adoption, feasibility and fidelity. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic pain is at the heart of the opioid epidemic and back pain is the most common condition leading to chronic pain. Improving back pain management and reducing disparities are important considerations in reducing the opioid crisis and improving the lives of impacted individuals.

"Clinical Optimization of Ultrasonic Drug Delivery Technologies for Underserved Minority US Veterans in Chronic Pain Project Summary: Narcotic use in pain management of underserved minority populations and minority United States veterans has played a major role in the ongoing opioid crisis. According to the NIH, veterans are more susceptible to opioid addiction and are 40% more likely to suffer from severe chronic joint pain then non-veterans. Over the next decade, the percentage of minority veterans will increase from 23% to 34% and is expected to rise. This shift of racial and ethnic minorities directly correlates to the growing demographics of minority active duty soldiers that make up over 40% of our nation’s military forces. The federal government considers the 18.2 million veteran and 42 million non-veteran minority Americans to be ""potentially vulnerable patient populations” with health disparities particularly related to joint diseases care. Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the most common of these joint diseases affecting the entire US population, and of considerably higher 19-fold incidence and prevalence in the service- disabled veteran population. Although the disease itself does not appear to occur more frequently in minorities, its effects and progression are more severe. This is especially true among minorities with arthritis, 36.7% of Black patients and 35.5% of Hispanic patients reported severe joint pain compared to only 23.0% of non-Hispanic Whites. The economic burden of veterans with OA is estimated to approach or exceed $60 billion annually due to longer life expectancies. Arthritis is also a significant economic and health burden in the United States at large which is estimated to exceed $394 billion in healthcare costs by 2030. Our Phase I SBIR NIH/NIMHD HEAL project is aimed at revolutionizing the treatment of chronic pain in the home-setting for the underserved. ZetrOZ Systems miniature ultrasound technology can increase targeted transdermal drug delivery into tissue by 2-20 times providing effective pain relief. Additionally, the ultrasonic drug delivery technology has shown clinical potential in reducing chronic joint pain by 50-70%. In Phase I of this project we will first (1) optimize ultrasonic dosimetry (frequency, intensity, and treatment algorithm) for increased drug delivery, and integrate the technologies into easy-to-apply and easy-to-use wireless systems for clinical evaluation. Secondly (2), we will determine the clinical potential of the innovative drug delivery systems in treating minority veteran chronic pain, by evaluating the technology in an 8-week double blind placebo controlled clinical trial on chronic joint pain. The HEAL INITIATIVE response team includes biomedical scientists and engineers from ZetrOZ Systems (global leader in wearable ultrasound technologies), and clinician researchers and practitioners from the James A. Haley Veterans' Hospital Tampa, Florida (a center of excellence for chronic pain management). Together, we will develop an innovative ultrasonic drug delivery technology accessible for minorities and underserved communities to reduce disparities and opioid use in the healthcare system of America. Project Narrative: This project proposes to clinically optimize localized ultrasonic drug delivery technologies for underserved minority United States Veterans in chronic pain. Wireless ultrasonic patches to enhance the transfer and effectiveness of topical diclofenac pain relief gel will be evaluated in the home-setting by minority veterans for clinical efficacy.",Clinical

"Cooperative Pain Education and Self-management: Expanding Treatment for Real-World PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) is an evidence-based psychological intervention that is effective for reducing pain and improving function for patients with chronic pain. Numerous barriers exist to face-to-face delivery of this treatment, including patient travel limitations, the need for frequent in-person sessions, and the scarcity of trained therapists. Leveraging technology-based interventions, like interactive voice response (IVR), which allow patients to engage in treatment from their home, may improve access to CBT-CP. The overall goal of this project is to conduct a pragmatic trial to examine the real world effectiveness of an IVR-based form of CBT-CP called COoperative Pain Education and Self-management (COPES). In the spirit of pragmatic trials, our approach will minimize clinic disruption and avoid adding research staff in the field by using the VHA’s electronic health record (EHR) to facilitate recruitment and to collect data, all while delivering COPES from a centralized VA location. In preparation for the pragmatic trial, the initial study phase (UG3) will: a) identify facilities to participate in the trial from among the 60 Women’s Health Practice Based Network (WH-PBRN) sites, b) examine the adequacy of the EHR for providing outcome data, c) determine the feasibility of using EHR provider alerts to promote recruitment and d) secure all regulatory approvals along with support from leadership at selected sites. Phase two (UH3) will then compare outcomes among Veterans randomized to either: 1) COPES, a 10-week IVR-based CBT and walking program plus any provider prescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain treatments (COPES+UC), or 2) in-person CBT-CP provided by clinicians, previously trained through VHA’s evidence based psychotherapy program plus any provider prescribed pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments (VHA CBT-CP+UC). Patients will be compared on a composite measure of pain intensity and functioning, EHR pain intensity, and health care use including emergency department, urgent care, and specialty pain services along with pharmacological and non-pharmacological pain interventions. Uptake and variation in outcomes across groups will also be evaluated where treatment disparities are possible (e.g. by sex, race, mental health comorbidities). Additionally, the cost of the COPES intervention will be examined, including intervention delivery expenditures and budget impact analysis. Finally, evaluation of the intervention process will be informed by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). CFIR-guided interviews with study site clinicians and administrators will assess experiences with the COPES and CBT-CP interventions and implementation findings will be communicated with participating sites and stakeholders. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cognitive behavioral therapy for chronic pain (CBT-CP) is an evidence-based intervention that is effective in reducing pain and improving function for Veterans with chronic pain, yet numerous barriers exist to widespread implementation of traditional CBT-CP, including patient travel limitations, the need for frequent in-person sessions, and the scarcity of trained therapists. Because technology-based interventions, like interactive voice response (IVR), allow patients to engage in treatment from their home, they may improve access to CBT-CP. The aim of the current project is to compare the real-world effectiveness of IVR-delivered CBT-CP compared to in-person CBT-CP in VHA settings.",Cooperative Pain Education and Self-management: Expanding Treatment for Real-World,10015199,UH3AT009767,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' EtOH use ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol use ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Cognitive Therapy ', ' Cognition Therapy ', ' Cognitive Psychotherapy ', ' cognitive behavior intervention ', ' cognitive behavior modification ', ' cognitive behavior therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral intervention ', ' cognitive behavioral modification ', ' cognitive behavioral therapy ', ' cognitive behavioral treatment ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Expenditure ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' male ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Persons ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Psychotherapy ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Substance Use Disorder ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Travel ', ' Veterans ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' Administrator ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Self Management ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' health administration ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' uptake ', ' programs ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Clinic ', ' Location ', ' Services ', ' Emergency Department ', ' Emergency room ', ' Accident and Emergency department ', ' experience ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Brief Pain Inventory ', ' Data ', ' Improve Access ', ' Multi-center clinical trial ', ' Multi-site clinical trial ', ' Multicenter clinical trial ', ' Multisite clinical trial ', ' Multi-Institutional Clinical Trial ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' sex ', ' ED care ', ' ER care ', ' Emergency Department care ', ' Emergency Room care ', ' Emergency health care ', ' Emergency healthcare ', ' Emergency medical care ', ' Emergency Care ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' cost ', ' implementation research ', ' improved functioning ', ' Outcome ', ' health practice ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Network-based ', ' trial comparing ', ' evidence base ', ' primary outcome ', ' routine care ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' Secure ', ' IRB ', ' IRBs ', ' Institutional Review Boards ', ' Pain intensity ', ' urgent care ', ' trial design ', ' treatment group ', ' formative evaluation ', ' formative assessment ', ' walking program ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' efficacy study ', ' recruit ', ' patient barriers ', ' patient-level barriers ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' patient with chronic pain ', ' chronic pain patient ', ' primary end point ', ' primary endpoint ', ' comparative effectiveness trial ', ' budget impact ', ' ']",NCCIH,YALE UNIVERSITY,UH3,2020,1101035,0.42896036312749714
"Chronic Pain Severity, Biomarkers of Dementia, and Ethnic/Race Group Differences: Predicting Alzheimer's Disease Vulnerabilities Project Summary/Abstract Non-Hispanic black (NHB) Americans experience greatly increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease compared to non-Hispanic white (NHW) Americans. Health-related vulnerabilities are linked with biopsychosocial stress, which disproportionately affects NHB populations. Living with chronic pain is stressful. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a highly prevalent and debilitating chronic pain condition that affects NHB adults more severely than NHW adults. Chronic pain is associated with elevated systemic inflammation and increased risk of dementia, both of which disproportionately affect NHB Americans. Additionally, NHB Americans also have elevated genetic and biological markers of dementia but there are weaker relationships between those biomarkers and dementia in NHB than NHW populations. Evidence suggests the amyloid-positive brains of NHB adults appear older than expected. This might be due to ethnic/race groups differences in environmental, sociocultural, and health- related stress exposures. Cumulative exposure across the lifespan might reduce brain reserve and induce vulnerabilities to dementia by taking a toll on the biological system. This suggests life experience factors, including chronic pain, might play a role in neurodegenerative processes. Therefore, ethnicity/race, with consideration for sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, combined with pain severity might serve as a key vulnerability for Alzheimer’s disease. What is not known is whether: 1) NHB and NHW with chronic knee pain differ in biomarkers of inflammation and dementia, and if 2) NHB with high pain severity have relatively greater changes in those biomarkers and global cognition over time compared to their NHW peers. We will use data from an existing R01 to process plasma biomarkers and novel brain MRI biomarkers of inflammation and dementia. We have comprehensive biopsychosocial, MRI, and general cognitive data for 120 adults with evidence of chronic pain (60 NHB, 60 NHW) across a two-year period. Our findings will 1) contribute to an improved understanding of the dynamics between chronic pain, ethnicity/race, and dementia risk; and 2) promote the identification of novel brain MRI biological markers sensitive to stress-related exposure and dementia risk. Project Narrative Alzheimer’s disease, psychosocial stress, and chronic pain unequally burden non-Hispanic black compared to non-Hispanic white adults. The goal of this project is to better understand relationships between ethnicity/race groups, chronic pain severity, and dementia-related risk factors including changes in brain structure over a two- year period. The long-term intention is to identify factors contributing to health disparities and strategies to reduce Alzheimer’s disease risk for adults with chronic pain.","Chronic Pain Severity, Biomarkers of

"University of Florida Resource Center for Minority Aging Research PROJECT SUMMARY Chronic pain conditions represent arguably the most prevalent and costly public health problem in the United States, and they are the leading cause of disability worldwide. While pain affects individuals throughout the lifespan, older adults are disproportionately impacted and are at particularly increased risk for chronic pain and pain-related disability. Surprisingly, knowledge regarding the biopsychosocial mechanisms underlying age- related increases in pain remains quite limited, therefore, increased research is needed to elucidate social and behavioral contributions to pain and disability among older adults. A critical barrier to progress in this area of research is the limited availability of investigators with appropriate interdisciplinary training in addressing later life pain and disability. With strong institutional support, the University of Florida (UF) Resource Center for Minority Aging Research (RCMAR) will be established to address these scientific and workforce development needs. The UF RCMAR has an educational objective to provide outstanding training and career development opportunities to promising investigators from underrepresented backgrounds. The UF RCMAR's research objective is to conduct innovative and impactful transdisciplinary social and behavioral research addressing pain and disability among older adults, including health disparities in later life pain and disability (e.g. racial and ethnic differences, sex and gender differences, and socioeconomic influences). The UF RCMAR will accomplish these objectives through the synergistic efforts of four Cores: an Administrative Core (AC), a Research Education Component (REC), an Analysis Core (AnC), and a Community Liaison and Recruitment Core (CLRC). In addition, the UF RCMAR will benefit from extensive collaborations with other UF entities, including The UF Pain Research & Intervention Center of Excellence (PRICE), the UF Institute on Aging (IOA), and the UF Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI). The UF RCMAR boasts an outstanding interdisciplinary group of Core Faculty with expertise spanning the spectrum of clinical and translational research related to our theme of biopsychosocial contributions to pain and disability among older adults. In order to accomplish its objectives, the UF RCMAR will recruit and retain outstanding early stage investigators from unrepresented backgrounds and provide them with excellent mentoring and career development support. Through its research activities, the UF RCMAR will produce novel and important information regarding social and behavioral contributors to pain and disability in older adults, and will develop and test innovative interventions to reduce later life pain and disability.

"Key Molecular Mechanisms of Chronic Pain Vulnerability in Women Experiencing MVC Abstract Exposure to traumatic events is common in life. In industrialized nations, motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) are one of the most common types of trauma, with over 50 million MVCs occurring worldwide each year. The great majority of individuals experiencing MVC do not have serious injury; in the US more than 90% of individuals seen in the emergency department after MVC are discharged home after evaluation. However, a substantial proportion of such individuals develop chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSP).  Most individuals who develop chronic MSP following MVC are women. This fact is consistent with the marked increase in MSP burden experienced by women vs. men in other settings. Biopsychosocial mechanisms responsible for this increased vulnerability remain poorly understood, leading the NIH and eminent pain scientists to call for more research aimed at addressing this knowledge gap.  The candidate, Dr. Sarah Linnstaedt, is an RNA biologist who seeks a K01 career development award to gain the training necessary to perform studies that will provide important new insights into the biologic mechanisms, and the interactions between these mechanisms and cognitive/psychosocial factors, that contribute to chronic MSP pathogenesis in women. Specifically, the proposed career development award will provide Dr. Linnstaedt with the knowledge and skills necessary to (1) evaluate candidate biological mechanisms within contemporary, state-of-the-art biopsychsocial models of chronic MSP that include influential cognitive and psychosocial factors, (2) perform studies of sex-specific biological mechanisms that previous data, and the candidate’s pilot data, suggest contribute to chronic MSP in women, and (3) evaluate potential interactions between biological and psychosocial factors. Data for this work will be drawn from biologic samples collected as part of a mentor’s longitudinal cohort study of chronic MSP pathogensis after MVC. By the end of the award period, Dr. Linnstaedt will have the necessary knowledge, experience, skills, and data to obtain an R01 and become an independently-funded translational research scientist whose work addresses the current marked disparity in chronic pain incidence among women. Project Narrative Little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms leading to increased chronic pain in women. The candidate's first-in-kind studies will use biological samples and cognitive/psychosocial data from a longitudinal cohort of individuals enrolled following motor vehicle collision trauma to evaluate candidate mediators of pain pathogenesis in women.

"iCanCope with Sickle Cell Disease Project Summary Pain related to sickle cell disease (SCD) is most often treated in the home by patients and families, but this management is typically suboptimal. SCD mostly affects people of African descent. This population is known to suffer many racial and cultural inequities related to the medical management of SCD pain. Cognitive- behavioral therapies (CBT) that promote pain self-management can lead to symptom reduction, improved quality of life, and decreased healthcare use. However, most people with SCD do not receive CBT-based treatment due to barriers such as poor accessibility, limited availability of professionals, and high costs. Youth with SCD must assume more responsibility for managing their SCD pain, which typically becomes more chronic in adulthood. However, many youth never develop these important self-management skills during childhood and are poorly prepared to cope with SCD pain as adults. There is a critical need for innovative pain self-management programs that are accessible and tailored for youth with SCD pain. Access to web and mobile technologies among African Americans is high. In a qualitative study conducted by our group, youth with SCD, parents, and healthcare professionals indicated that these technologies could be applied to meet their pain self-management needs. Based on our team experiences in developing and testing web- and mobile- based pain management programs in other populations, we hypothesize that this approach will also be effective for delivering pain self-management to youth with SCD. In this application, our goal is to improve pain self-management and functioning in youth (aged 12-18) with SCD by developing and testing a tailored web and smartphone-based application (iCanCope with SCD). First, we plan to apply a user-centered design approach to refine and beta test the program. The program will include: (I) goal setting, (II) peer-based social support, and (III) pain self-management training. Second, we will determine program feasibility and initial program effectiveness through a pilot three-site randomized controlled trial. Preliminary effectiveness will be determined in 160 youth randomized to treatment compared to attention control. We hypothesize that youth who receive iCanCope with SCD will achieve greater reduction in pain intensity, pain-related disability and increased adaptive coping strategies (primary outcomes) as well as significant improvement in physical and emotional functioning and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up compared to youth who receive the attention-control condition. Third, we will explore moderators and mediators of treatment effect. This project represents a significant advance in delivering tailored psychological therapies for youth with SCD. Our long-term goal is to develop effective and flexible treatments that can be delivered at low cost to reduce SCD pain and disability, and better equip youth to cope with SCD as adults. Project Narrative Smartphone and Internet technologies can be leveraged to deliver engaging and flexible pain self- management therapies to adolescents with sickle cell disease and their caregivers. Our long-term goal is to develop effective and scalable treatments that can be delivered at low cost to reduce pain and disability, and better equip adolescents with strategies to cope with their

"Pain in community-based older African American Adults: The Jackson Heart Study Chronic pain affects over 100 million American adults, with an estimated cost of $560-635 billion annually, yet this major burden is relatively understudied in African Americans (AAs). Older adults are at increased risk of having multiple painful conditions and are living longer with the negative impacts of chronic pain. Chronic pain, regardless of anatomy or diagnosis involved (e.g., back pain, migraine), is the leading cause of disability worldwide. Limited insights into whether common mechanisms underlie all pain conditions, regardless of diagnosis, has contributed to inadequate pain management options. Health care providers who treat one pain condition (e.g., joint pain) typically do not manage symptoms in other parts of the body (e.g., abdominal pain), and patients are often referred from one specialist to another. Studying commonalities of various chronic overlapping pain conditions (COPC) in community-based cohorts unselected for pain conditions can provide novel insights into causes and consequences of chronic pain as a disease itself. For example, neurophysiologic alterations in pain processing such as pain sensitization (assessing ascending pain pathways) and conditioned pain modulation (CPM) (assessing descending pain modulation) may be common mechanisms underlying all chronic pain. Such knowledge would spur development of novel pain management approaches for all types of pain regardless of anatomy or diagnosis involved. Despite the substantial public health burden of chronic pain, little is known about the epidemiology and evolution of COPC in older AA adults, nor of the impact of COPC on physical or psychosocial function, risk of nursing home admission, and mortality in older AAs. We propose to evaluate chronic pain in the upcoming study visit of a thoroughly-characterized community-based older AA cohort unselected for any pain complaints, the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) (N~2540, two-thirds ≥age 65). We aim to understand the epidemiology of COPC, regardless of anatomy or diagnosis involved, the evolution of COPC over time, neurophysiologic alterations in pain processing, healthy lifestyle factors and psychosocial factors as risk factors for COPC, and consequences of COPC and altered pain processing in older adults. We propose acquiring objective quantitative sensory testing (QST) measures of pain sensitization and CPM, which are associated with pain severity in experimental settings. Whether QST-assessed neurophysiologic alterations may be common underlying risk factors for all forms of chronic pain, and for poor physical and psychosocial functioning, institutionalization, and mortality in a community-based cohort of older AAs unselected for pain is unknown. We will collect data regarding a multitude of chronic pain conditions, QST, healthy lifestyle factors, physical and psychosocial function, and nursing home admissions during the next planned study visit, as well as two follow-up assessments to obtain longitudinal data, and leverage the ongoing JHS surveillance of mortality. Our work will address several knowledge gaps, and insights gained may ultimately facilitate new preventive and therapeutic approaches to relieving chronic pain and its consequences, regardless of underlying diagnosis. PROJECT NARRATIVE Chronic pain is a leading cause of disability in the US and globally, especially among older adults, yet management options are limited and fundamental knowledge regarding causes and consequences of chronic overlapping pain conditions is lacking. We propose an inter-disciplinary study of chronic overlapping pain conditions in older African American adults who have been understudied in this regard, with a focus on neurophysiologic alterations, healthy lifestyle factors and psychosocial factors as underlying risk factors, and the impact of chronic overlapping pain conditions and neurophysiologic alterations in pain processing on physical and psychosocial function, ability to live independently, and mortality risk. The proposed work will bring new insights into chronic pain as a condition itself regardless of anatomic location of pain, with an aim to help the millions suffering from chronic pain.",Pain in community-based older African American Adults: The Jackson Heart Study,10120296,R01AG066914,"['Abdominal Pain ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomic Sites ', ' Anatomic structures ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Arthralgia ', ' Joint Pain ', ' Back Pain ', ' Back Ache ', ' Backache ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Evolution ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutionalization ', ' Joints ', ' Maintenance ', ' mortality ', ' neurophysiology ', ' neurophysiological ', ' Nursing Homes ', ' nursing home ', ' Degenerative polyarthritis ', ' Degenerative Arthritis ', ' Osteoarthritis ', ' Osteoarthrosis ', ' degenerative joint disease ', ' hypertrophic arthritis ', ' osteoarthritic ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Psychologist ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Specialist ', ' Migraine Headache ', ' Migraine ', ' chronic pain ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Neurological ', ' Neurologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Body part ', ' disability ', ' Distress ', ' insight ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Individual ', ' postiive attitude ', ' optimism ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Therapeutic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Severities ', ' Sensory ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Organ System ', ' body system ', ' Musculoskeletal ', ' Physical Function ', ' gastrointestinal ', ' psychosocial ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' stressor ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' Sampling ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' International ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' life-style factor ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' years lived with disability ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' rheumatologist ', ' surveillance study ', ' followup assessment ', ' follow up assessment ', ' social health determinants ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' healthy life-style ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' racial health disparity ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' chronic pain condition ', ' chronic pain disorder ', ' chronic painful condition ', ' conditioned pain modulation ', ' pain processing ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' death risk ', ' mortality risk ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' ']",NIA,BOSTON UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CAMPUS,R01,2020,702564,0.4850233805584441
"Biobehavioral basis of knee osteoarthritis pain Project Summary/Abstract. Discovery and validation of strong candidate biomarkers and clinical endpoints for pain is urgently needed that can be used to facilitate the development of non-opioid pain therapeutics from discovery through Phase II clinical trials. Emerging research using a combination of biomarkers deliver individualized predictions about future brain and body health. Our own findings suggest that behavioral chronic pain characteristics are associated with multiple biological biomarkers where a greater pain burden is associated with accelerated detrimental biological processes. However, prospective research is urgently needed to determine pain’s impact on the heterogeneity of these biological processes within an individual to elucidate the underlying patterns of biological changes using a biobehavioral perspective which is needed for predicting future health and to be able to use as clinical endpoints for interventions. The proposed study will prospectively address biobehavioral factors (i.e., cognitive, psychological, social and cultural) affecting the experience and interpretation of knee pain and physical function across racial/ethnic groups over time. We will prospectively assess pain along with multiple biomarkers as predictors of cognitive, psychological and physical functional progression among middle-aged and older non- Hispanic Blacks and non-Hispanic Whites with knee pain and controls over a four-year study period. With strong support from the University of Florida, our interdisciplinary project, using a comprehensive biobehavioral multi- methods approach, we will be the first to prospectively determine the trajectory and interactions among pain, biological biomarkers and multiple domains of function within race/ethnic groups in OA pain. Findings will contribute towards increased understanding of pain and its biobehavioral basis, with the potential to reduce race/ethnic group disparities and improve pain-related health and functional outcomes. Project Narrative Our recent cross-sectional findings suggest that chronic pain is associated with multiple biological aging biomarkers where a greater pain burden is associated with accelerated aging processes. Thus, the goal of the proposed study is to determine the brain and bodily aging mechanisms whereby pain prospectively impacts function in aging and whether these are different across racial/ethnic groups.

"Prospective Study of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Chronic Pain and Pain Burden ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden on racial and ethnic minorities. Substantial inequities exist in the pain treatment received by African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. Data suggest that members of these minority groups are not only more likely to develop chronic pain but also to have this pain accompanied by greater pain burden, i.e., greater suffering, poorer life quality, and worse functional impairment. Only modest headway has been made in understanding why race and ethnicity confer pain inequities and how best to address these disparities. The long-term objective of the proposed research is to contribute to the reduction or outright elimination o racial and ethnic pain disparities. The near-term goal of the planned research is to identify a small set of the most promising intervention targets, from among the plethora of posited explanations, for reducing or eliminating racial/ethnic pain disparities. The planned study would be, to our knowledge, the first ever prospective examination of factors posited to underlie racial and ethnic disparities in the transition from acute to chronic pain. The study would also be the first to investigate these issues in the important context of recovery following serious physical injury requiring hospitalization. For the proposed research, a sample of 900 adult survivors of serious physical injury, comprised of roughly equal proportions of African-Americans, Latinos, and non-Latino Whites, will be recruited during hospitalization from large trauma centers in Los Angeles, CA and Philadelphia, PA. Interviews will be conducted during hospitalization and at 3-, and 12-month follow-up. Medical records will provide information on injury severity and medication use in-hospital which may influence the course of pain. The specific aims are (1) to determine whether African-American and Latino physical injury survivors experience more severe pain following injury relative to their non-Latino White counterparts; (2) to determine whether African-American and Latino injury survivors experience greater pain burden relative to their non- Latino White counterparts; (3) to determine whether African-American and Latino differences in pain severity or pain burden can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for interventions aimed at reduction or elimination of pain outcome disparities; and (4) To determine whether pain outcomes in at-risk minority groups can be linked to a small set of promising candidates to serve as targets for group-tailored interventions to reduce pain severity and pain burden irrespective of whether these candidates contribute to between-group pain disparities. The knowledge gained from the proposed research has high potential to accelerate efforts aimed at eliminating racial and ethnic pain disparities by identifying promising targets for prevention and intervention efforts to close the pain gap. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Chronic pain poses a disproportionate public health burden for African-Americans and Latinos relative to their non-Latino White counterparts. The proposed prospective investigation will study African-American, Latino, and non-Latino White physical injury survivors from initial hospitalization for a period of one year to identify promising intervention targets to reduce or eliminate racial/ethnic pain disparities.",Prospective Study of Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Chronic Pain and Pain Burden,9881196,R01MD010372,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitals ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Medical Records ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Prospective Studies ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' trauma centers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Latino ', ' chronic pain ', ' injuries ', ' Injury ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute ', ' Solid ', ' Survivors ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Recovery ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Severities ', ' experience ', ' member ', ' Sampling ', ' Functional impairment ', ' functional disability ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' prospective ', ' Trauma ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' public health relevance ', ' group intervention ', ' racial minority ', ' recruit ', ' pain outcome ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' implementation strategy ', ' ']",NIMHD,RAND CORPORATION,R01,2020,809085,0.4157326854888374
"Treatment of Consequences of Female Genital Cutting Project Summary/Abstract The National Pain Strategy notes the importance of addressing pain in minority populations to reduce health disparities. One such population is female refugees who have been victim to female genital cutting (FGC) --- which is known to cause sexual pain. The objective of the proposed research is to collect empirical data to (1) inform the conceptualization of sexual pain and other outcomes among Somali women living in Minnesota who have experienced FGC, (2) promote healthcare practices that minimize sexual pain, and (3) develop decision- making tool(s) and education seminars driven by study findings. The majority of Somali girls undergo infibulation when originally cut, which involves stitching the vaginal opening shut. Deinfibulation (i.e. opening the circumcision/infibulation scar) may decrease pain and is necessary before vaginal birth. It is recommended before labor and delivery; however, many patients wait until labor and delivery to undergo deinfibulation –thus increasing a risk in tears. Little is known about how sexual pain and sexual function are impacted by the timing of deinfibulation. To better understand sexual pain in relation to FGC, we will rely upon conceptual models that utilize a biopsychosocial approach, integrating biological, psychological, and cultural considerations. These models include fear-avoidance, endurance, and resilience. We will partner with a community-based organization (SoLaHmo) and two large medical clinics serving Somali American women to conduct 75 qualitative interviews, 300 computer assisted surveys of Somali-American married women 18-45 years who have experienced FGC to accomplish the following aims: Aim 1: Qualitatively investigate sexual pain characteristics and meaning ascribed to sexual pain. Aim 2: Establish reference levels using descriptive statistics to quantify sexual pain characteristics (presence, frequency, intensity), sexual function, pain responses (fear avoidance, endurance, resilience), and moderator variables (acculturation and shared decision making) in this population. Aim 3: Among women who have vaginally delivered one or more babies, determine if sexual pain characteristics and sexual function are associated with the timing of deinfibulation with first child. Aim 4: Among women reporting sexual pain in Aim 3, determine if pain responses (fear avoidance, endurance, resilience) are associated with sexual pain and sexual function, and whether these associations are modified by degree of acculturation --- while adjusting for timing of deinfibulation. The long-term goal is to identify mechanisms that will lead to better pain management in this population. Completion of these novel study aims will generate information to develop evidence-based and culturally- sensitive medical and psychological interventions for women who have undergone FGC. Due to recent immigration patterns, there has been a large increase in girls and women in the U.S. healthcare system who have experienced female genital cutting (FGC; a.k.a. female circumcision) --- a common outcome of FGC is sexual pain. The proposed research project will investigate factors that may contribute to increased risk of developing chronic sexual pain among circumcised Somali American women living in Minnesota. The overall goal is to gather information that may used by mental health and medical professionals to provide culturally- sensitive and empiricall- informed healthcare.",Treatment of Consequences of Female Genital Cutting,9980951,R01HD091685,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Back ', ' Dorsum ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cicatrix ', ' Scars ', ' Male Circumcision ', ' Circumcision ', ' Coitus ', ' Sexual Intercourse ', ' Communities ', ' Confidence Intervals ', ' Decision Making ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Effect Modifiers (Epidemiology) ', ' Conditional Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Effect Modifiers ', ' Moderator Variables ', ' Episiotomy ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Female ', ' Goals ', ' Headache ', ' Cephalalgia ', ' Cephalgia ', ' Cephalodynia ', ' Cranial Pain ', ' Head Pain ', ' head ache ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Immigration ', ' Interview ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Minnesota ', ' Mothers ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Postpartum Hemorrhage ', ' Post-partum Hemorrhage ', ' Refugees ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Sex Behavior ', ' Sexual Activity ', ' Sexual Behavior ', ' sex activity ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Somalia ', ' statistics ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' UNICEF ', ' Vagina ', ' Vaginal ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Woman ', ' Female Circumcision ', ' Measures ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Advocacy ', ' base ', ' Chronic ', ' Biological ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Immigrant ', ' Infibulations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Frequencies ', ' Clinic ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' girls ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Vaginal birth ', ' Vaginal delivery ', ' Vaginal delivery procedure ', ' female external genital cutting ', ' female external genitalia cutting ', ' female genitalia cutting ', ' female genital cutting ', ' sexual functioning ', ' Sex Functioning ', ' computer aided ', ' Computer Assisted ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' evidence base ', ' shared decision making ', ' ']",NICHD,UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA,R01,2020,590344,0.3284295363606766
"Examining the effects of contextually-imposed cognitive load on providers' chronic pain treatment decisions for racially and socioeconomically diverse patients Project Summary/Abstract Compared to individuals who are White and have high socioeconomic status (SES), those who are Black and have low SES experience greater pain and disability and are more likely to receive suboptimal pain care. One potential contributor to these disparities is biased provider decision-making. There is compelling evidence that providers are influenced by patient race and SES when making treatment decisions. Pain is subjective, and providers often make pain care decisions with insufficient information. Consequently, providers may fill these information gaps with stereotypes about race and SES groups, leading to systematic differences in pain care. According to the dual process model (DPM) and previous studies, people are more likely to use such stereotypes when they are under high cognitive load (i.e., mental workload). Health care settings place high cognitive demands on providers via time pressures, noises levels, and interruptions. Another factor that may contribute to biased provider decision-making is implicit beliefs (subconscious, automatic stereotyping), which have been found to be associated with health care disparities. One stereotype belief relevant to pain care is that Black and low SES individuals are more pain tolerant. Previous studies suggest that many providers hold these beliefs about pain tolerance. Consistent with the DPM, providers who are under high cognitive load and who have strong beliefs that Black and low SES people are more pain tolerant may be particularly likely to recommend fewer pain treatments for Black and low SES patients. To test these hypotheses, the proposed study will recruit physician residents and fellows to view videos and make pain treatment decisions for 12 computer-simulated patients with low back pain that vary by race (Black/White) and SES (low/high); treatment options will include analgesic medications, complementary and alternative approaches, lifestyle changes, and referrals to specialty care. Half of the providers will be randomized to the high cognitive load group in which they will be interrupted during the treatment decision task to make Morphine Equivalent Dose conversions. Providers in the control group will not be interrupted during the treatment decision task. Providers’ implicit beliefs about race and SES differences in pain tolerance will be measured with Implicit Association Tests. The primary analyses will examine the main and interaction effects of patient race and SES on providers’ treatment decisions for chronic pain (aim 1), examine the main and interaction effects of patient race [SES] and cognitive load on providers’ treatment decisions (aim 2), and examine the main and interaction effects of patient race [SES], cognitive load, and providers’ implicit beliefs about race [SES] differences in pain tolerance on providers’ treatment decisions (aim 3). Multilevel modeling will allow for the examination of these effects at the individual provider and group levels. The proposed study is highly innovative and represents a crucial step in combating disparities in pain care. Ultimately, the project findings may lead to evidence-based interventions that target cognitive load and biased provider beliefs and thereby reduce disparities. Project Narrative Compared to individuals who are White and have high socioeconomic status (SES), those who are Black and have low SES are at heightened risk for receiving suboptimal pain care. The proposed project will examine the effects of patient race and SES, contextually-imposed cognitive load, and providers’ implicit beliefs about pain tolerance on their treatment decisions for chronic pain. This research is of high potential significance, as it may lead to interventions that target cognitive load and biased provider beliefs and thereby reduce disparities in pain care.",Examining the effects of contextually-imposed cognitive load on providers' chronic pain treatment decisions for racially and socioeconomically diverse patients,9989635,F31MD014058,"['Affect ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Analgesics ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Anodynes ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' pain killer ', ' pain medication ', ' pain reliever ', ' painkiller ', ' Belief ', ' Computers ', ' Control Groups ', ' Decision Making ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Empathy ', ' Goals ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Low Back Pain ', ' Low Back Ache ', ' Low Backache ', ' Lumbago ', ' Noise ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' pressure ', ' Productivity ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Subconscious ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Workload ', ' Work Load ', ' medical costs ', ' Medical Care Costs ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' doubt ', ' Uncertainty ', ' chronic pain ', ' Caring ', ' Pain Tolerance Level ', ' pain tolerance ', ' Pain Threshold ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' psychosocial ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' experience ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Dose ', ' Interruption ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Cognitive ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' virtual human ', ' Chronic low back pain ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' develop therapy ', ' intervention development ', ' treatment development ', ' therapy development ', ' combat ', ' mindfulness ', ' clinical decision-making ', ' cognitive burden ', ' cognitive load ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' disparity in care ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' health care disparity ', ' recruit ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' morphine equivalence ', ' morphine equivalent ', ' ']",NIMHD,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,F31,2020,44150,0.3356744290252943
"Ethnic Differences in Responses to Painful Stimuli Project Summary/Abstract The purpose of this research project is to provide research and career development training for Mr. Cesar E. Gonzalez, a doctoral student in Medical/Clinical Psychology Program at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. This administrative supplement in response to PA-18-906: “Research Supplements to Promote Diversity in Health-Related Research (Admin Supp) will expand the parent project “Ethnic differences in response to painful stimuli” (R37AG033906, PI-Roger B. Fillingim). The supplement will support the pre-doctoral education, research, and mentoring activities for the candidate, Mr. Cesar E. Gonzalez, MA, with the overarching goal of developing him into an independent investigator specializing in minority aging and health disparities, including sleep and painful knee osteoarthritis. The primary aim of the proposed research is to determine the extent to which differences in nightly sleep quality between older Blacks and Whites contribute to racial disparities in knee pain and disability. Thus, we will examine whether objective (actigraphy) and subjective (diaries, questionnaires) measures of sleep: 1) differ between Black and Whites with knee osteoarthritis, and 2) are differentially associated with experimental and clinical pain experiences between Blacks and Whites. The career development component of this administrative supplement will enhance Mr. Gonzalez’s research potential and capabilities to pursue an independent research career in minority aging, sleep, and chronic pain outcomes. This will be accomplished through a series of didactic and experiential training activities, which will be overseen by Mr. Gonzalez’s two mentors, Dr. Burel R. Goodin at UAB and Dr. Roger Fillingim at UF. Completion of the proposed research and training plan will equip Mr. Gonzalez with a unique combination of skills pertaining to the role of sleep in promoting optimal health, as well as clinical and translational pain research. This expertise, combined with his advanced training in clinical psychology, will provide Mr. Gonzalez with distinctive capabilities to pursue his own independent and systematic line of research in the future. Narrative Chronic pain from osteoarthritis is an important health problem for the United States population. Ethnic/racial differences in clinical pain and pain-related disability in older adults with knee osteoarthritis are well documented, yet the biobehavioral contributors to these disparities remain poorly understood.

"A Mixed Method Study on Ethnicity-Specific Physical Pain Among Older Women Project Summary/Abstract The main goal of the proposed SC3 research is to improve the rigor of our laboratory’s current SC3 research on pain in mainly low-income older women. We will collect a sample of the same size and ethnic composition as that of the current grant, but will use a mixed method approach. This will allow us to go beyond the mere quantification of pain intensity -- which is a typical shortcoming of most of the pain literature -- by studying pain context factors both qualitatively and quantitatively. The outcomes of this research will help fill a gap in the ethnogeriatric literature. Management of pain in older age is a major health challenge that is a top NIH research priority. This is especially the case regarding pain care disparities, which NIH has urged to investigate a) within specific racial and ethnic groups as well as b) among older adults (Institute of Medicine, 2011), as we plan on doing in this study. Innovatively, we developed our own questions to best measure pain context factors via both open-ended qualitative and Likert-type scale items. Some of them were adapted by the PI from the classic Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s (2004) guidelines on best practices for pain assessment and pain medication treatment, undertreatment, and overtreatment. In addition to being based on a review of the literature, other items were based on the PI’s in-person consultations with the American Pain Society’s former president and with medical doctors and nurses belonging to this professional organization. Using the empirically-supported inclusion criterion of experiencing pain within the past 4 weeks, we plan to: create pain profiles based on the entire sample (N=300), with 100 African-American, 100 Hispanic-American, and 100 European-American older women in Aim 1; identify ethnicity-specific pain profile differences, find ethnicity-specific reasons for these differences, and create ethnicity-specific pain profiles in Aim 2; as well as investigate the relationship of ethnicity-specific pain profiles with empirically validated pain-related quantitative variables in Aim 3. Measurements will include: a demographics list, a well-established and medically-focused pain questionnaire, the aforementioned new pool of pain context items, as well as quantitative measures of daily minor cognitive failures, non-medical stress, PTSD symptomatology, and depressive symptomatology. Project Narrative This project covers many issues of critical importance to a more in-depth understanding of the pain experience and pain management among different ethnic groups of older women, going beyond the simple quantification of pain in terms of its intensity, which is a shortcoming of most of the published pain research. Identifying pain profiles in our under-studied population would contribute to fundamental knowledge about questions not yet answered in the literature, such as whether older women’s pain experience and management differ by ethnicity and are related to pain-relevant cognitive and psychopathological factors. Applying this study’s results and broad conclusions could decrease pain symptomatology as well as reduce illness and disability, revealing time-saving ways to conceptualize and assess pain in a more in-depth and culturally sensitive fashion. Healthcare providers working in often-frantic medical settings could use this knowledge to quickly identify critical pain context factors that are most applicable to their patients and to minimize pain undertreatment or risky overtreatment.",A Mixed Method Study on Ethnicity-Specific Physical Pain Among Older Women,9856201,SC3GM094075,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Analgesics ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Anodynes ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' pain killer ', ' pain medication ', ' pain reliever ', ' painkiller ', ' Consultations ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Non-Prescription Drugs ', ' Nonprescription Drugs ', ' OTC Drugs ', ' Over-the-Counter Drugs ', ' Patent Medicines ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Interview ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Marijuana ', ' marihuana ', ' Massage ', ' massage therapy ', ' Methods ', ' Minor ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' pain assay ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Professional Organizations ', ' professional association ', ' professional membership ', ' professional society ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Savings ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders ', ' PTSD ', ' Post-Traumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Neuroses ', ' Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ', ' post-trauma stress disorder ', ' posttrauma stress disorder ', ' traumatic neurosis ', ' Suggestion ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' United States Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' SAMHSA ', ' Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' Comprehension ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' disability ', ' Failure ', ' European ', ' satisfaction ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Review Literature ', ' Nature ', ' Research Priority ', ' Knowledge ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Location ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' Structure ', ' Agreement ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Prevention ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' research dissemination ', ' research data dissemination ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' Pain Research ', ' Preparation ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' inclusion criteria ', ' demographics ', ' Pain intensity ', ' study population ', ' symptomatology ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' over-treatment ', ' overtreatment ', ' ']",NIGMS,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE,SC3,2020,108750,0.4780409491572038
"Using Technology to Deliver Evidence-Based Interventions for Pain to Patients with Sickle Cell Disease PROJECT ABSTRACT The overarching goal of this candidate's program of research is to improve behavioral and physical health and reduce health disparities by using multimedia technology to deliver evidence-based interventions to underserved populations. The focus is sickle cell disease (SCD), a condition that disproportionately affects those of African descent. Many people living with SCD suffer from daily chronic pain as well as recurrent acute pain episodes that require medical attention. Opioid medication is the primary treatment for pain in SCD, despite its limited effectiveness and negative side-effects. The proposed K23 attempts to address the need for an alternative, non-pharmacological pain treatment in SCD. Computerized cognitive behavioral therapy (cCBT) has been found effective for reducing chronic pain and may be a low cost, easily accessible and scalable pain treatment in SCD. The candidate's K12 project tested a cCBT program for anxiety and depression; preliminary results suggest that patients liked using the program, but found that much of its content did not relate to their lives. To address this limitation, the proposed K23 project will adapt an existing cCBT program for pain management to create ReThink Pain SCD, a culturally-tailored, mobile-phone delivered behavioral intervention designed specifically to help African American patients self-manage chronic sickle cell pain. Aim 1: Modify and tailor the generic cCBT pain program, using qualitative research methods to understand the needs and barriers to pain management in patients with SCD, as well as the opportunities to engage this population using multimedia. These data will inform the development of the features and content of ReThink Pain SCD. Aim 2: Conduct a pilot pragmatic clinical trial to test the feasibility and acceptability of implementing this pain intervention into routine SCD care. Forty patients with SCD will be randomized to either receive 8 sessions of the cCBT program or 8 online education modules on a smartphone. Primary outcomes of the trial include feasibility (recruitment, retention, provider and patient feedback) and acceptability (sessions completed) of the ReThink Pain SCD program. In order to achieve the goals of this research plan and transition to independence, the candidate requires further training in user-centered design, implementation science, design and conduct of pragmatic clinical trials, and team management and leadership. This proposal includes an exceptional team of mentors and consultants. Primary mentor Dr. Bruce Rollman is founding Director of the Center for Behavioral Health and Smart Technology. Co-mentor Dr. Robert Noll is a clinical psychologist with expertise in behavioral intervention trials. Co-mentor Dr. Laura De Castro is a nationally recognized trialist and expert in sickle cell disease. This training and research plan will form the basis for a future multicenter clinical trial testing the efficacy of ReThink Pain SCD for improving pain outcomes among adults with SCD, to be proposed in an R01 grant application before the end of the K23 award. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project seeks to determine whether a tailored behavioral intervention delivered over mobile phones can be an effective therapy for chronic pain in a predominately African American patient population, specifically patients living with sickle cell disease. Ultimately, this research will inform the delivery of evidence-based pain treatment in racial and ethnic minorities living with chronic pain.",Using Technology to Deliver Evidence-Based Interventions

"Investigating Movement-evoked Pain in osteoArthritic Conditions (IMPACT): An Observational Study to Inform Culturally-Tailored Intervention Development Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is one the most problematic sources of persistent musculoskeletal pain, impaired function and mobility, and reduced quality of life in older adults. Although these are common outcomes associated with OA, they are disproportionately worse in older African Americans. These threats to healthy aging demand further investigation into the most significant driver of OA pain and disability, which is movement. The experience of pain due to movement, known as movement-evoked pain (MEP), often prohibits full participation in daily living activities and self-management actions such as physical activity/exercise. MEP is consequently a substantial contributor to high-impact chronic pain and disability in people with OA; yet, our understanding of the mechanisms contributing to MEP and its management in older African Americans is severely limited. Therefore, the overall goals for this two-phased Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) is to fill this knowledge gap by (1) characterizing the biopsychosocial-behavioral mechanisms of MEP and function and (2) develop a mechanism-based self-management intervention (Pain Relief for OsteoArthritis using Culturally-Tailored InterVentions for Black Elders [PROACTIVE]). This intervention will address the most pivotal and culturally-relevant predictors of MEP and impaired function in older African Americans. Our methods represent a new and substantive departure from current static pain assessments in chronic musculoskeletal disorders by measuring pain with movement. This K23 proposes training and research activities that will launch a program of research which advances the science of pain and disability in African American older adults. To this end, I have assembled an interdisciplinary team of senior scientists representing nursing, psychology/pain science, aging, and epidemiology/community engagement who will provide mentorship to help me achieve proposed training goals and facilitate my transition to an independent research career. Primary training goals essential to my research program include: (1) advance understanding of biopsychosocial and behavioral- environmental mechanisms of OA pain, (2) develop a comprehensive knowledge base in the application of community-engaged participatory research within experimental designs, and (3) enhance translational research skills to function as an independent investigator capable of conducting rigorous clinical trials testing the effectiveness of non-pharmacological, behavioral chronic pain self-management interventions within a cultured community (e.g., southern African Americans). Phase 2 of the K23 will apply community-based participatory mixed-methods to collaboratively create the PROACTIVE intervention. The University of Florida and University of Connecticut are strong incubators for pain research and provide ideal environments to extend the PI’s prior work and forge a path towards understanding multiple biopsychosocial and behavioral mechanisms uniquely involved in the intra-ethnic experience of chronic pain, which are key to the discovery of better therapeutic interventions and self-management behaviors. Osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee is the leading source of movement-evoked pain (MEP) and physical function disability in older adults globally; however, the mechanisms driving MEP and severe functional limitations in older African Americans are unknown but of critical importance. The patterning of disparate health outcomes in African American older populations necessitates interventions that will reduce the economic, functional, and psychological burden associated with high-impact chronic OA pain and disability. Thus, the proposed work will elucidate the biopsychosocial-behavioral mechanisms associated MEP and function in a sample of older African Americans, which will inform the development of a mechanism-based, culturally-tailored self-management intervention to attenuate MEP and functional impairment.",Investigating Movement-evoked Pain in osteoArthritic Conditions (IMPACT): An

"Psychological and brain mechanisms underlying disparities in opioid and non-opioid pain treatment decisions Project Summary Unequal prescribing of opioid and non-opioid analgesics among demographic groups contributes to two major health disparities in the United States. Overprescribing of opioid analgesics to treat both acute and chronic nonmalignant pain, especially in non-Hispanic whites, has fueled the opioid abuse epidemic. Underprescribing of opioid and non-opioid analgesics in minorities and women, even when their use is medically indicated (e.g., acute and cancer pain), reduces the effectiveness of pain management in these groups. In order to mitigate analgesic prescribing disparities and the associated risks of opioid abuse and poor pain management, we must understand the mechanisms underlying these disparities. The current project will test two potential contributors to these pain treatment disparities: 1) clinicians' inaccurate demographic stereotypes about pain sensitivity and tendency to abuse opioids (i.e., the stereotype hypothesis), and 2) reduced activation of clinicians' pain-related neural systems (e.g., anterior cingulate and anterior insula) in response to the pain of demographic outgroup patients (i.e., the vicarious pain hypothesis). Prior studies of mechanisms underlying analgesic prescribing disparities have been limited by the use of experimental paradigms that were low in ecological validity e.g. asking participants to make prescribing decisions based solely on text-based medical vignettes or depictions of individuals feigning pain. Additionally, although the robust fMRI literature on vicarious pain biases is related to biases in pain assessment, vicarious pain biases have not been tested as a potential contributor to biases pain treatment decisions. In the present proposal, these methodological limitations will be addressed and the stereotype and vicarious pain hypotheses will be tested through 3 specific aims. Aim 1 involves the design and production of a more ecologically valid video-based simulated pain assessment and treatment paradigm depicting individuals experiencing genuine pain. Aim 2 includes an fMRI study of the effects of clinicians' (medical students') vicarious pain responses and pain stereotypes on demographic biases in simulated pain assessment and analgesic prescribing, using the video paradigm created in Aim 1. Finally, to determine the clinical applicability of the findings from Aim 2, Aim 3 includes face-to-face pain assessments and treatment recommendations during simulated clinical interactions with standardized patient actors. If the aims of this proposal are achieved, these studies will yield new understanding of the relative contributions of pain-related stereotypes and vicarious pain to analgesic prescribing disparities. These results could indicate whether pain stereotype education, efforts to increase pain empathy, or both should be incorporated into clinician interventions aimed at reducing analgesic prescribing disparities. Through this K01 career development award, the candidate will gain facility in three areas not included in her past training: clinical pain assessment and treatment, multivariate statistical analysis, and behavioral medicine in order to more effectively understand psychosocial and neurobiological mechanisms underlying health disparities in pain and pain management. Project Narrative The need for effective interventions to reduce overprescribing of opioids grows more urgent as the number of individuals affected by the opioid crisis continues to rise, and the need to improve pain management in minority populations becomes more critical as minority populations in the U.S. grow. The proposed research uses a novel combination of neurobiological (fMRI) and behavioral measures to investigate mechanisms underlying clinicians' gender and ethnic biases in opioid and non-opioid analgesic pain treatment decisions. The findings of this research can inform improvements in clinician training aimed as mitigating analgesic prescribing disparities and the associated risks of opioid abuse and poor pain management.",Psychological and brain mechanisms underlying disparities in opioid and non-opioid pain treatment decisions,9882988,K01DA045735,"['Affect ', ' Pain management ', ' Pain Control ', ' Pain Therapy ', ' pain treatment ', ' Analgesics ', ' Analgesic Agents ', ' Analgesic Drugs ', ' Analgesic Preparation ', ' Anodynes ', ' Antinociceptive Agents ', ' Antinociceptive Drugs ', ' pain killer ', ' pain medication ', ' pain reliever ', ' painkiller ', ' Opioid Analgesics ', ' opiate analgesia ', ' opiate analgesic ', ' opiate pain medication ', ' opiate pain reliever ', ' opioid analgesia ', ' opioid anesthetic ', ' opioid pain medication ', ' opioid pain reliever ', ' opioid painkiller ', ' Behavioral Medicine ', ' Brain ', ' Brain Nervous System ', ' Encephalon ', ' Cues ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Drug abuse ', ' abuse of drugs ', ' abuses drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Empathy ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Facial Expression ', ' face expression ', ' Facial Pain ', ' Face Pain ', ' Goals ', ' Hospitals ', ' indexing ', ' Insula of Reil ', ' Central Lobe ', ' Insula ', ' Island of Reil ', ' Literature ', ' Methodology ', ' Nationalities ', ' Neurobiology ', ' neurobiological ', ' Neurosciences ', ' opioid abuse ', ' opiate abuse ', ' opiate drug abuse ', ' opioid drug abuse ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Pain Measurement ', ' Analgesia Tests ', ' Nociception Tests ', ' Pain Assessment ', ' pain assay ', ' Patients ', ' Production ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Standardization ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Mediating ', ' chronic pain ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Acute Pain ', ' Anterior ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sexism ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Training ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Opiates ', ' Opioid ', ' Nonnarcotic Analgesics ', ' Nonopioid Analgesics ', ' non-narcotic analgesic ', ' non-opiate analgesic ', ' non-opioid ', ' nonopiate analgesic ', ' nonopioid ', ' non-opioid analgesic ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' Functional MRI ', ' fMRI ', ' Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Scanning ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' cancer pain ', ' experience ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' neural ', ' relating to nervous system ', ' skills ', ' simulation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' social group ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' K-Awards ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Cognitive ', ' nonmalignant ', ' Non-Malignant ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Text ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' willingness ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical applicability ', ' clinical application ', ' neurobiological mechanism ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' effective treatment ', ' effective therapy ', ' licit opioid ', ' opiate medication ', ' opioid medication ', ' prescribed opiate ', ' prescribed opioid ', ' prescription opiate ', ' prescription opioid ', ' Pain intensity ', ' University resources ', ' ethnic bias ', ' disparities in treatment ', ' treatment disparity ', ' opiate crisis ', ' opioid crisis ', ' opioid epidemic ', ' patient screening ', ' pain sensitivity ', ' clinical pain ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIDA,UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI CORAL GABLES,K01,2020,171208,0.49555743622115656
"Estradiol and Zoster Associated Orofacial Pain ABSTRACT People with herpes zoster (HZ) or “shingles” can suffer from orofacial pain. Orofacial HZ is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the trigeminal ganglia. Importantly, women report HZ pain three times more often than men, but the mechanism for this sex disparity is unknown. A screen by our lab of over 20,000 genes in five different regions of the orofacial pain pathway revealed that the greatest change in gene expression occurred in the thalamus, such that glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) were elevated at proestrus (high 17 β-estradiol, E2) but not diestrus (low E2). In preliminary studies we showed that female rats have a greater VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response in comparison to males; mirroring the human sex difference. We also showed that reducing E2 production in male and female rats increases their nociceptive response and lastly, knock-down of VGAT expression in the thalamus increased the nociceptive response. Based on these studies we hypothesized that E2 attenuates orofacial nociception by increasing GAD2 or VGAT, enhancing GABAergic neural inhibition within the thalamus to reduce pain. To test this hypothesis, Aim 1 will characterize thalamic control of the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. The working hypothesis for Aim 1 is that GABA interneurons inhibit neurons in the thalamus to reduce VZV induced nociception. To test this hypothesis first, VZV induced nociception and neuronal activity will be recorded after attenuating inhibitory interneurons. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be determined after modulating GAD2 and VGAT expression in these interneurons. Aim 2 will determine the role of sex steroids in modulating the VZV induced nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 will increase expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus causing attenuation of neuronal activity and the nociceptive response. To test this hypothesis first, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be measured in female and male rats after administering E2 or reducing E2 production. Second, nociception and neuronal activity will be measured after knock-down of GAD2 and VGAT expression in rats with varied E2 levels. Aim 3 will characterize the mechanism by which sex steroids modulate VGAT and GAD2 to affect the VZV induced orofacial nociceptive response. Our working hypothesis is that E2 binds to estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) causing increased expression of VGAT and GAD2 in the thalamus resulting in attenuation of nociception. To test this idea, the nociceptive response and neuronal activity will be quantitated in rats after mutating ERα promoter sites using CRISPR/Cas9 technology. From these three aims we expect to determine 1) that GABA interneurons inhibit thalamic signaling to reduce orofacial pain, 2) that GAD2 and VGAT increases in these neurons through an ERα dependent mechanism, and 3) that GAD2 and VGAT are responsible, in part, for the sex difference observed in HZ pain. Identifying a mechanism by which E2 affects HZ-associated pain will provide new targets for treating people suffering from this chronic disorder. Project Narrative These studies will evaluate the role of two neuron inhibitory genes, glutamate decarboxylase 2 (GAD2) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT). Thalamic expression of these two genes was regulated by estrogen and the role of these genes in the underlying molecular pathogenesis of Zoster associated nociception will be evaluated in this application. These experiments will provide valuable insights into an area of Herpes Zoster pain biology and pathology that are poorly understood and highly prioritized by the NIDCR. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Novel genes by which 17β-estradiol affects orofacial hypersensitivity will be identified, providing a greater understanding of why females suffer greater pain and allow for

"Identifying Opportunities to Improve Hydroxyurea Therapy Initiation and Adherence among Children with Sickle Cell Disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): SUMMARY Approximately 1 in 500 African American births are diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD), which is associated with substantial morbidity and risk of early mortality. Among affected individuals, sickling of the red blood cells causes excruciating, chronic pain, which is the most common symptom of SCD. The presence of pain indicates suboptimal disease management and results in substantial financial burden on the healthcare system. Over 50% of children with SCD have at least one pain crisis a year; these pain crises are associated with substantially lower quality of life, as well as inadequate sleep, more school absences, chronic depression, and impaired peer relationships. The frequency, intensity, and duration of pain crises can only be controlled through appropriate disease management using the medication hydroxyurea. Use of hydroxyurea therapy by children with SCD is associated with lower rates of initial and recurrent episodes of pain, hand-foot syndrome (dactylitis), acute chest syndrome, and hospitalization compared with no hydroxyurea therapy. Given the substantial potential of hydroxyurea therapy to reduce pain crises and other clinical complications among children with SCD, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) released (2014) recommendations for its use among children. All children (9 months or older) with specific subtypes of SCD should be offered hydroxyurea therapy to reduce its health-related complications, irrespective of disease severity. The existing body of evidence regarding the use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD is based on studies conducted prior to the NHLBI recommendation for use among all children. Consequently, there is a complete gap in knowledge regarding use of hydroxyurea therapy post NHLBI recommendations. Using administrative claims from states with the highest prevalence of SCD, complemented by focus groups with key stakeholders, this research project will identify multiple levels of opportunities for improvement in appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among children with SCD. In addition, this project provides the framework to enable me to become a successful independent investigator and a leader in reducing health disparities among children with severe chronic conditions through development of expertise in comparative effectiveness, qualitative methods, and medication adherence theory. Combined, these research and training activities will provide a crucial foundation for a subsequent application to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to gauge the effectiveness of interventions targeted at SCD patients, their caregivers, and providers of SCD services to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy among this vulnerable population. To this end, the following aims will be investigated: Research Aim 1: Quantify hydroxyurea therapy prevalence prior to NHLBI guidelines, and changes in prevalence post-NHLBI guidelines among children with SCD using Medicaid administrative claims data, as well as predictors of hydroxyurea initiation and adherence.  Specific Aim 1a: Assess baseline hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD prior to NHLBI guidelines (2005-2012). Specific Aim 1b: Evaluate changes in hydroxyurea therapy prevalence among children with SCD post- NHLBI guidelines (2011-2017). Specific Aim 1c: Identify characteristics associated with hydroxyurea initiation and subsequent adherence among children with SCD. Research Aim 2: Evaluate the comparative effectiveness of hydroxyurea therapy among adherent users on reducing the incidence of pain crises, adverse outcomes, and use of health services, compared with those having limited or no use of hydroxyurea therapy. Research Aim 3: Identify barriers to initiation and adherence of hydroxyurea therapy through focus groups conducted among adolescents with SCD, caregivers of children with SCD, and SCD health services providers in Michigan. Overall Career Development Aim: To acquire the skills and experience necessary to conduct an R01-funded comparative effectiveness trial to increase appropriate use of hydroxyurea therapy in children with SCD. These aims will be achieved during 3 phases of research over 5 years under the guidance of a multi- disciplinary team of experienced mentors. Through the conduct of high quality research, formal coursework, and interaction with mentors, this K01 award will provide the PI with the necessary training to become a successful independent investigator and to develop a future R01 grant application. If successful, this line of inquiry will improve health outcomes and quality of life among children with SCD. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Severe pain episodes are the most common, debilitating, and costly morbidity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Use of hydroxyurea is the only method to prevent these pain crises among children, and interventions to increase its use are urgently needed. This project will identify of opportunities to develop targeted interventions to increase the use of hydroxyurea among this high-risk population.",Identifying Opportunities to Improve Hydroxyurea Therapy Initiation and Adherence among Children with Sickle Cell Disease,9948723,K01HL132057,"['Affect ', ' Sickle Cell Anemia ', ' Hb SS disease ', ' HbSS disease ', ' Hemoglobin S Disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disease ', ' Hemoglobin sickle cell disorder ', ' sickle cell disease ', ' sickle disease ', ' sicklemia ', ' Birth ', ' Parturition ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Decision Making ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Services ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' hydroxyurea ', ' Hydroxycarbamid ', ' Hydroxycarbamide ', ' hydroxy-urea ', ' Incidence ', ' Medicaid ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Michigan ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Pain ', ' Painful ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Recommendation ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Schools ', ' Sleep Deprivation ', ' deficient sleep ', ' inadequate sleep ', ' insufficient sleep ', ' sleep debt ', ' sleep deficiency ', ' sleep deficit ', ' sleep insufficiency ', ' sleep loss ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' chronic pain ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Training ', ' sickle RBC ', ' sickle erythrocyte ', ' sickle red blood cell ', ' Sickle Cell ', ' Individual ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' health care service use ', ' healthcare service use ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' health care service utilization ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Knowledge ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Disease Management ', ' Frequencies ', ' Severities ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' Palmar-Plantar Erythodysthesia ', ' hand-foot syndrome ', ' palmar-plantar erythrodysthesia ', ' Palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome ', ' Services ', ' Chronic depressive disorder ', ' chronic depression ', ' experience ', ' skills ', ' peer ', ' acute chest syndrome ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Adherence ', ' Age-Months ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' High Prevalence ', ' K01 Award ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Program ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Subgroup ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' drug adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Impairment ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' public health relevance ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' adverse consequence ', ' adverse outcome ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economic disadvantage ', ' socio-economically disadvantaged ', ' socio-economically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' common symptom ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' service providers ', ' reduce pain ', ' pain reduction ', ' financial burden ', ' financial distress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial stress ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' comparative effectiveness trial ', ' effectiveness testing ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,K01,2020,130860,0.23058523725936134
