"ADIPOSITY AND FAT PATTERNING IN BLACK AMERICANS Recent studies have shown that fat pattering is an important risk factor for diabetes and possibly cardiovascular diseases. The Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health (1985) concluded that diabetes and cardiovascular diseases were among the six causes of death that contribute most to the disparity in death rates between blacks and whites, yet the relationship of fat patterning with these diseases is largely unstudied in blacks.  Since there are known racial differences in growth rates, body proportions and adiposity, it cannot be assumed that studies done on whites are applicable to blacks.  The objective of this research is to examine the relationship of obesity and fat patterning with morbidity and mortality in black Americans.  Data collected in the Charleston Heart Study (1960-1988) offers a rate opportunity to examine these issues.  This long-term prospective study includes black and white individuals of both sexes, and will allow racial comparisons between subjects from the same community.  The specific aims of the study are as follows:  1. provide estimates of cross sectional relationships between anthropometric measures of body dimensions (abdominal, central and upper body fat patterning and total adiposity) with diabetes, blood pressure, plasma lipids and glucose, and left ventricular wall thickness.  2. identify anthropometric predictors of diabetes, blood pressure, plasma lipids and glucose, and left ventricular wall thickness over a 24 year interval.  3. identify anthropometric predictors of survival over a 25 year period with reference to mortality from CHD, CVD and all cause mortality.  4. describe body dimensions by race and sex groups and examine the changes in the shapes of individuals who have had measurements repeated after a 24 year interval.  5. determine the importance of changes in anthropometric measurements with aging for the prediction of diabetes, blood pressure, plasma lipids and glucose, left ventricular wall thickness, mortality from all causes and mortality form CHD and CVD.  This research will provide important information concerning the role of adiposity and fat patterning in diabetes and CVD in blacks, and has implications for the prevention and treatment of these diseases.

"MEANINGS OF RACE, CLASS, AND GENDER IN HEART DISEASE The four broad, long-term objectives of the proposed research include: (a) improving the conceptualization and operationalization of race, class, and gender in epidemiologic and health services research; (b) elucidating the processes through which, and the social contexts within which, racial- ethnic, class, and gender differences are thought to make some individuals more vulnerable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its adverse outcomes; and (c) understanding how racial-ethnic, class, and gender backgrounds of individuals influence their conceptions of health risks, behaviors, relationships with health providers, and understandings of chronic illness and disability. The research undertakes an examination of the disciplinary conventions and practices of epidemiology and health services research, and of the experiences of individuals with CVD.  The three specific aims of this research are: (1) to illuminate the ways in which race, class, and gender have implicitly or explicitly been conceptualized and studied in epidemiologic and health services research on CVD; (2) to examine how definitions of race, class, and gender conventionally used in such research have shaped what we know about inequalities in CVD incidence and outcomes; and (3) to explore how individuals with CVD themselves view their racial-ethnic, class, and gender backgrounds as having effects on their social and economic circumstances and resources, health beliefs and behaviors, access to and evaluation of medical information, and ultimately on their cardiovascular health.  The methods for achieving these aims are: content analysis of published reports; participant observation of presentation and discussion at epidemiologic and health services research conferences; in-depth interviews with 10 medical investigators of CVD; and in-depth interviews with 10 Asians/Pacific Islander, 10 Black, and 10 Hispanic men and women with coronary heart disease or hypertension.  Qualitative analysis will be conducted using systematic processes of coding and category construction that enable constant comparison of findings across data sources.

"STRESS REDUCTION AND ATHEROSCLEROTIC CVD IN BLACKS The President's Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Initiative of 1998 emphasizes that African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans.  Numerous controlled studies suggest that this disparity is associated with chronic psychosocial and environmental stress.  For these reasons, the NHLBI Working Group on Research in Coronary Heart Disease in Blacks has mandated behavior and prevention in this minority population as a national research priority. Our research team has previously demonstrated in NHLBI-supported randomized controlled trials that hypertension can be effectively treated in high risk African Americans with stress reduction using the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program compared to control procedures.  These and other studies have also reported clinically significant improvements in other CVD risk factors, psychosocial stress, myocardial ischemia, left ventricular mass and mortality rates from CVD and all-causes in high risk subjects randomized to active stress reduction. Preliminary findings from our recently completed, NHLBI-supported clinical trial of stress reduction in the prevention of hypertensive heart disease in inner city African Americans has indicated that atherosclerotic CVD, assessed by carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), significantly regresses after eight months of active stress reduction intervention compared to control education.  These results were comparable to effects of lipid lowering therapies or extensive lifestyle modification. This proposed continuation project will extend these findings by investigating the effectiveness of active stress reduction in the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD in African Americans. This five year study will be a randomized, single-blind, controlled, community-based trial involving 184 African American subjects with known coronary heart disease.  Male and female subjects will be enrolled at our on-going field site, Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center in inner city Los Angeles.  After baseline testing, subjects will be randomized to either active stress reduction with TM or health education control-both in addition to usual medical care-and posttested after 12 months. The primary outcome will be carotid artery atherosclerosis (IMT) measured non-invasively by quantitative B-mode ultrasonography. Secondary measures will include traditional CVD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, smoking, exercise), psychosocial stress, quality of life and cost effectiveness.  The results of this clinical trial will yield valuable new knowledge for the prevention of CVD through behavioral means in high risk African Americans.

"ALEXANDER CENTER FOR CAM, MINORITY AGING AND CVD Older African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of morbidity, mortality, and disability compared to older white Americans. The largest contributor to this health disparity is cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this population. Therefore, in accordance with national research priority mandates, the overall goal of the Alexander Center for Research in CAM, Minority Aging and CVD is to evaluate the efficacy is to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of CAM approaches for the prevention of this epidemic disease in older African Americans. The Alexander Center is a unique interdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration of leading academic and clinical centers in CAM and conventional medicine. These partner institutions have an established record of collaborating together on NIH-supported randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness and mechanisms of CAM modalities, specifically in older African Americans at high risk for CVD. The participating institutions include: Maharishi University of Management- College of Maharishi Vedic Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine, Morehouse School of Medicine and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Preliminary studies conducted by the present team have found that approaches of traditional Vedic medicine, in particular meditation intervention, is associated with significant reductions in hypertension, psychosocial stress, surrogate endpoints for atherosclerotic CVD and hypertensive-heart disease, and mortality over long-term follow-up in this aging minority population. Therefore, the Center will conduct well-controlled basic and clinical research, developmental programs, research training, and establish core services, administrative structures and procedures to support this research program. Proposed research programs with older high risk African American populations and cores include: 1) a basic study of mechanisms of meditation on atherosclerotic CVD (arterial vasomotion, cardiac autonomic tone and psychosocial risk factors), 2) a clinical trial of effects of meditation on carotid atherosclerosis, CVD risk factors, physiological mechanisms, psychosocial risk factors and quality of life in older Black women with CVD, 3) a controlled study on mechanisms and clinical effects of a traditional herbal antioxidant compared to conventional vitamin supplementation on carotid atherosclerosis, endothelial function, oxidative stress, CVD risk factors, and quality of life, 4) an Administrative Core to provide organizational structure and procedures, an overall Advisory Council, training of graduate and postgraduate CAM researchers and future developmental studies, 5) a Biostatistical and Research Methods Core that will provide statistical and methodological support for research projects.

"HYPERTENSION IN BLACK AMERICANS: A LIFE COURSE APPROACH   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract) Increasingly,                researchers are recognizing that risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in            adulthood is rooted in the social and material life conditions of childhood,         and that these childhood conditions may predict risk for CVD above and beyond        traditional adulthood indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) such as               education, occupation or income. Nowhere is this life course perspective on CVD      risk more important than in the case of African Americans, especially the            generation that ""came of age"" in the U.S. South in the late 1950s and 1960s,         the peak years of the modern Civil Rights Movement. While some African American      members of this age cohort were able to take advantage of the new opportunities      for economic advancement, some others were not, resulting thereafter in              different life course trajectories of exposure to social and economic hardship.      The relationship between variations in these social and economic life course         trajectories, and CVD risk (specifically hypertension) in adulthood, has not         been investigated in African Americans. The proposed research will address this      question in the Pitt County (NC) cohort, a community sample of African               Americans (N=1784, 66 percent female, 80 percent response rate) who were             between 25-50 years of age at intake in 1988. Normotensives in the baseline          sample were re-examined in 1993 (N=1195, 66 percent female, 85 percent response      rate). In addition to measuring blood pressure, extensive data on psychosocial,      behavioral, and anthropometric characteristics were obtained at both times. The      proposed study will re-examine the original cohort in 2001; the anticipated          sample size is 1142 individuals (717 women and 425 men). Starting from age 20,       respondents' reported exposure to three domains of socioenvironmental stressors      will be assessed: (1) adverse socioeconomic conditions; (2) low levels of            social integration; and (3) racial discrimination. Taken individually, and then      collectively, the greater the cumulative life course exposure to these               stressors, the greater the risk for adult hypertension is expected to be. The        primary analyses will focus on the relationship between pre-1988 exposures and       1988 BP status (retrospective analyses), and the relationship between pre-1988       exposures and changes in BP status between 1988 and 2001(prospective analyses).      The investigators state that the Pitt County study population presents a             special opportunity to examine these questions and also contribute to                constructing a scientific knowledge base of great relevance to ongoing national      efforts to eliminate racial inequalities in CVD.

"HYPERTENSION IN BLACK AMERICANS: A LIFE COURSE APPROACH   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract) Increasingly,                researchers are recognizing that risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in            adulthood is rooted in the social and material life conditions of childhood,         and that these childhood conditions may predict risk for CVD above and beyond        traditional adulthood indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) such as               education, occupation or income. Nowhere is this life course perspective on CVD      risk more important than in the case of African Americans, especially the            generation that ""came of age"" in the U.S. South in the late 1950s and 1960s,         the peak years of the modern Civil Rights Movement. While some African American      members of this age cohort were able to take advantage of the new opportunities      for economic advancement, some others were not, resulting thereafter in              different life course trajectories of exposure to social and economic hardship.      The relationship between variations in these social and economic life course         trajectories, and CVD risk (specifically hypertension) in adulthood, has not         been investigated in African Americans. The proposed research will address this      question in the Pitt County (NC) cohort, a community sample of African               Americans (N=1784, 66 percent female, 80 percent response rate) who were             between 25-50 years of age at intake in 1988. Normotensives in the baseline          sample were re-examined in 1993 (N=1195, 66 percent female, 85 percent response      rate). In addition to measuring blood pressure, extensive data on psychosocial,      behavioral, and anthropometric characteristics were obtained at both times. The      proposed study will re-examine the original cohort in 2001; the anticipated          sample size is 1142 individuals (717 women and 425 men). Starting from age 20,       respondents' reported exposure to three domains of socioenvironmental stressors      will be assessed: (1) adverse socioeconomic conditions; (2) low levels of            social integration; and (3) racial discrimination. Taken individually, and then      collectively, the greater the cumulative life course exposure to these               stressors, the greater the risk for adult hypertension is expected to be. The        primary analyses will focus on the relationship between pre-1988 exposures and       1988 BP status (retrospective analyses), and the relationship between pre-1988       exposures and changes in BP status between 1988 and 2001(prospective analyses).      The investigators state that the Pitt County study population presents a             special opportunity to examine these questions and also contribute to                constructing a scientific knowledge base of great relevance to ongoing national      efforts to eliminate racial inequalities in CVD.

"STRESS REDUCTION AND ATHEROSCLEROTIC CVD IN BLACKS The President's Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Initiative of 1998 emphasizes that African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans.  Numerous controlled studies suggest that this disparity is associated with chronic psychosocial and environmental stress.  For these reasons, the NHLBI Working Group on Research in Coronary Heart Disease in Blacks has mandated behavior and prevention in this minority population as a national research priority. Our research team has previously demonstrated in NHLBI-supported randomized controlled trials that hypertension can be effectively treated in high risk African Americans with stress reduction using the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program compared to control procedures.  These and other studies have also reported clinically significant improvements in other CVD risk factors, psychosocial stress, myocardial ischemia, left ventricular mass and mortality rates from CVD and all-causes in high risk subjects randomized to active stress reduction. Preliminary findings from our recently completed, NHLBI-supported clinical trial of stress reduction in the prevention of hypertensive heart disease in inner city African Americans has indicated that atherosclerotic CVD, assessed by carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), significantly regresses after eight months of active stress reduction intervention compared to control education.  These results were comparable to effects of lipid lowering therapies or extensive lifestyle modification. This proposed continuation project will extend these findings by investigating the effectiveness of active stress reduction in the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD in African Americans. This five year study will be a randomized, single-blind, controlled, community-based trial involving 184 African American subjects with known coronary heart disease.  Male and female subjects will be enrolled at our on-going field site, Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center in inner city Los Angeles.  After baseline testing, subjects will be randomized to either active stress reduction with TM or health education control-both in addition to usual medical care-and posttested after 12 months. The primary outcome will be carotid artery atherosclerosis (IMT) measured non-invasively by quantitative B-mode ultrasonography. Secondary measures will include traditional CVD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, smoking, exercise), psychosocial stress, quality of life and cost effectiveness.  The results of this clinical trial will yield valuable new knowledge for the prevention of CVD through behavioral means in high risk African Americans.

"ALEXANDER CENTER FOR CAM, MINORITY AGING AND CVD Older African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of morbidity, mortality, and disability compared to older white Americans. The largest contributor to this health disparity is cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this population. Therefore, in accordance with national research priority mandates, the overall goal of the Alexander Center for Research in CAM, Minority Aging and CVD is to evaluate the efficacy is to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of CAM approaches for the prevention of this epidemic disease in older African Americans. The Alexander Center is a unique interdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration of leading academic and clinical centers in CAM and conventional medicine. These partner institutions have an established record of collaborating together on NIH-supported randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness and mechanisms of CAM modalities, specifically in older African Americans at high risk for CVD. The participating institutions include: Maharishi University of Management- College of Maharishi Vedic Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine, Morehouse School of Medicine and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Preliminary studies conducted by the present team have found that approaches of traditional Vedic medicine, in particular meditation intervention, is associated with significant reductions in hypertension, psychosocial stress, surrogate endpoints for atherosclerotic CVD and hypertensive-heart disease, and mortality over long-term follow-up in this aging minority population. Therefore, the Center will conduct well-controlled basic and clinical research, developmental programs, research training, and establish core services, administrative structures and procedures to support this research program. Proposed research programs with older high risk African American populations and cores include: 1) a basic study of mechanisms of meditation on atherosclerotic CVD (arterial vasomotion, cardiac autonomic tone and psychosocial risk factors), 2) a clinical trial of effects of meditation on carotid atherosclerosis, CVD risk factors, physiological mechanisms, psychosocial risk factors and quality of life in older Black women with CVD, 3) a controlled study on mechanisms and clinical effects of a traditional herbal antioxidant compared to conventional vitamin supplementation on carotid atherosclerosis, endothelial function, oxidative stress, CVD risk factors, and quality of life, 4) an Administrative Core to provide organizational structure and procedures, an overall Advisory Council, training of graduate and postgraduate CAM researchers and future developmental studies, 5) a Biostatistical and Research Methods Core that will provide statistical and methodological support for research projects. In conclusion, the Alexander Center will provide a unique and well- established platform for evaluation and translation of CAM modalities for the prevention of CVD in high risk older African Americans.

"LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD PREDICTORS OF CVD  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: There are few comprehensive databases that allow for a longitudinal examination of how neighborhood-level factors may interact with individual characteristics to predict incident cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.   Primary Aims: This cross-institutional project joins investigators from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Stanford University, known for their expertise in immigrant health and social inequalities in CVD. The primary aims will examine how neighborhood social characteristics (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), social disintegration, socioeconomic and ethnic segregation, social capital), physical environments (e.g., geocoded assets including goods and services contributing to health such as educational and recreational resources; barriers to health including pollution, industries, waste dumps, criminal activity, alcohol and fast food outlets) and individual factors (e.g., SES, CVD risk factors, country of birth and social networks) may interrelate to predict CVD [morbidity and mortality] and all-cause mortality.  Design/methods: We will use data from a newly created, comprehensive set of Swedish databases, MigMed and MigSALLS. MigMed (1990-2002) includes data for the entire Swedish population of 6 million women and men aged 25 and older, of whom 600,000 are first generation immigrants. Their addresses have been geocoded, yielding 9,677 neighborhoods, which will be reduced to a smaller number of defined units by cluster analyses. MigMed includes an annual assessment of individual-level sociodemographic and health indicators. We will also analyze data from MigSALLS (1988-2002), which includes more in-depth data from face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of approximately 18,000 women and men aged 25-74, of whom 2,000 are first generation immigrants. MigSALLS contains similar individual- and neighborhood-level factors as MigMed, as well as extensive information on factors that may mediate relationships between neighborhoods and CVD outcomes (e.g., CVD risk factors such as smoking, weight, physical activity, and blood pressure). Information from these two datasets will be matched to hospital and death records (300,000 deaths and 140,000 incidence cases of CVD expected between 1988-2002), thus creating one of the largest databases in the world involving men and women from diverse SES levels and countries of origin.

"STRESS REDUCTION AND CVD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY-II DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans. Substantial evidence indicates that high levels of psychosocial and socioenvironmental stress contribute to the excessive morbidity and mortality in this population. In earlier controlled trials with African Americans and other populations at high risk for CVD, the current collaborative team demonstrated that a selected stress reduction approach, the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program, was associated with significant reductions in CVD risk factors and surrogate markers for clinical CVD. These include clinically significant decreases in hypertension, myocardial ischemia and carotid atherosclerosis, as well as improvements in psychosocial stress and quality of life. In the previous NHLBI-sponsored clinical trial, 201 African American men and women with documented coronary heart disease (mean age 59 years) were randomized to either stress reduction with the TM program or a health education control. The results showed 50 percent lower risk of combined mortality and CVD morbidity in the stress reduction group compared to control (RR = .50, p <.05) after a median three year follow-up period. Preliminary analysis, in preparation for the proposed study, suggests lower risk of ""hard"" events alone--mortality, MI and stroke (RR= .42; p = .15).  The proposed study will conduct long-term follow-up of intervention and testing of the previous trial of 201 African American participants for an additional five funded years. This study will definitively evaluate long-term effects of behavioral stress reduction compared to control on ""hard"" CVD endpoints and sustainability of disease-free survival on combined ""hard"" and ""soft"" CVD endpoints (all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, coronary revascularizations, and hospitalizations for heart failure and ischemic heart disease, non-MI). Secondary outcomes will include traditional CVD risk factors (BP, lipids, diet, exercise, weight), psychosocial risk factors (depression, hostility, anger), quality of life, medication use, compliance, and cost effectiveness. To our knowledge, this is the only randomized controlled trial of behavioral stress reduction for the secondary prevention of CVD in African American men and women. The results of this unique long-term study will contribute critical new knowledge for the elimination of racial and ethnic diparities in health.

"Pilot Testing the Deaf Heart Health Intervention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall aims of the proposed pilot study are to: 1) test the feasibility of conducting the Deaf Heart Health Intervention as planned and 2) test the effectiveness of the Deaf Heart Health Intervention in decreasing modifiable risk factors for CVD among Deaf adults.  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States.  Numerous intervention projects have targeted modifiable CVD risk factors in varied ethnic populations and age groups.  The Health People 2010 document objectives include eliminating marked health disparities between people with disabilities and people without disabilities.  However, after an extensive literature review, we are unaware of any CVD intervention projects that have specifically targeted Deaf communities.  The term ""Deaf"" refers to a sociocultural subgroup of more than two million Americans who were significantly hearing-impaired at an early age, communicate primarily through sign language in adulthood, and participate in Deaf cultural communities.  The shared language, American Sign Language (ASL), and the culture of Deaf community members both unite them as a unique linguistic minority and separate them from the hearing world.  For Deaf community members, communication barriers frequently exist in combination with low income, limited education, secondary disabilities, and membership in ethnic minority groups-factors associated with poorer health status and greater risk for CVD than for other cohorts. The Deaf Heart Health Intervention (DHHI) is designed using social cognitive health behavior change principles integrated with teaching-learning strategies appropriate for the Deaf cultural context.  The DHHI is conducted by trained, Deaf health teachers for two hours/week for eight weeks, for a total of 16 hours of classroom time.  The proposed pilot test of the DHHI is a quasi-experimental, two group, repeated measures design.  We propose that accommodating the physical and sociocultural dimensions of Deafness in primary prevention programs will result in improved health status for Deaf adults.  Our vision is that multi-ethnic Deaf communities across the nation will have the capacity for sustained heart health promotion/risk reduction programs.         ",Pilot Testing the Deaf Heart Health Intervention,6596364,R15NR008009,"['deafness ', ' physical fitness ', ' human subject ', ' nursing research ', ' nursing intervention ', ' nutrition ', ' nutrition related tag ', ' health behavior ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stress management ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' ']",NINR,UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA,R15,2003,143775,0.1539104505658657

"Wounded Spirits, Ailing Hearts: PTSD and CVD in Indians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a unique psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction resulting from exposure to a stressful traumatic event(s). In the United States general population PTSD has a lifetime prevalence of 5 percent in men and 10 percent in women. PTSD is known to produce alternations in the central and autonomic nervous system and hormonal dysregulation. However, little is known about the long-term consequences of PTSD on the cardiovascular system. PTSD is a common disorder among reservation-dwelling American Indians (AIs) with a life-time prevalence of 12 percent in men and 23 percent in women. Similarly, cardiovascular disease (CVD), has emerged as a major health problem in AIs during the past decade. We propose to examine the relationship between PTSD and cardiac function in a population-based sample of AIs. The technical aims of this study involve: 1) the identification of AI men and women ages 18-52 who have a lifetime history of PTSD and are free from overt CVD; 2) the selection of an age-, sex-, and tribe-matched comparison group of AIs who have no history of PTSD and are free from known CVD; 3) a comprehensive lifestyle and clinical evaluation of the PTSD and non-PTSD groups to assess CVD risk factors such as smoking, exercise, obesity, blood pressure, concentrations of blood lipids, and inflammatory and thrombogenic factors; and 4) a set of non-invasive tests of subclinical CVD and other measures of CVD risk. These tests include positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging to examine coronary flow reserve, high-resolution ultrasound of the carotid arteries to measure carotid intima-media thickness, high-resolution ultrasound of the brachial artery to determine flow-mediated vasodilation, and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, to assess heart rate vadability (HRV). With these data, we will address our scientific aims, which are: 1) to determine whether individuals with PTSD, compared with those without PTSD, show greater evidence of subclinical CVD, including a lower coronary flow reserve, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and reduced forearm flow-mediated vasodilation; 2) to ascertain whether HRV is lower in individuals with PTSD compared to those without PTSD; and 3) to investigate the role of lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, exercise, obesity), cultural (e.g., acculturation, religiosity), and biological (e.g., blood pressure, blood lipid and glucose concentrations) mediators in the relationship of PTSD with coronary flow reserve and HRV. Since the emerging epidemic of CVD in AIs cannot be completely explained by changes in traditional risk factors, there is an urgent need to identify novel risk factors, like PTSD. Furthermore, the description of the influence of PTSD on the cardiovascular system could have immediate clinical and public health implications. Strategies for preventing PTSD, initiation of early treatment, and the identification of factors that mediate its potentially cardio-toxic effects could reduce morbidity and mortality from CVD.

"HYPERTENSION IN BLACK AMERICANS: A LIFE COURSE APPROACH   DESCRIPTION: (Adapted from the Investigator's Abstract) Increasingly,                researchers are recognizing that risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in            adulthood is rooted in the social and material life conditions of childhood,         and that these childhood conditions may predict risk for CVD above and beyond        traditional adulthood indicators of socioeconomic status (SES) such as               education, occupation or income. Nowhere is this life course perspective on CVD      risk more important than in the case of African Americans, especially the            generation that ""came of age"" in the U.S. South in the late 1950s and 1960s,         the peak years of the modern Civil Rights Movement. While some African American      members of this age cohort were able to take advantage of the new opportunities      for economic advancement, some others were not, resulting thereafter in              different life course trajectories of exposure to social and economic hardship.      The relationship between variations in these social and economic life course         trajectories, and CVD risk (specifically hypertension) in adulthood, has not         been investigated in African Americans. The proposed research will address this      question in the Pitt County (NC) cohort, a community sample of African               Americans (N=1784, 66 percent female, 80 percent response rate) who were             between 25-50 years of age at intake in 1988. Normotensives in the baseline          sample were re-examined in 1993 (N=1195, 66 percent female, 85 percent response      rate). In addition to measuring blood pressure, extensive data on psychosocial,      behavioral, and anthropometric characteristics were obtained at both times. The      proposed study will re-examine the original cohort in 2001; the anticipated          sample size is 1142 individuals (717 women and 425 men). Starting from age 20,       respondents' reported exposure to three domains of socioenvironmental stressors      will be assessed: (1) adverse socioeconomic conditions; (2) low levels of            social integration; and (3) racial discrimination. Taken individually, and then      collectively, the greater the cumulative life course exposure to these               stressors, the greater the risk for adult hypertension is expected to be. The        primary analyses will focus on the relationship between pre-1988 exposures and       1988 BP status (retrospective analyses), and the relationship between pre-1988       exposures and changes in BP status between 1988 and 2001(prospective analyses).      The investigators state that the Pitt County study population presents a             special opportunity to examine these questions and also contribute to                constructing a scientific knowledge base of great relevance to ongoing national      efforts to eliminate racial inequalities in CVD.

"LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD PREDICTORS OF CVD  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: There are few comprehensive databases that allow for a longitudinal examination of how neighborhood-level factors may interact with individual characteristics to predict incident cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.   Primary Aims: This cross-institutional project joins investigators from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Stanford University, known for their expertise in immigrant health and social inequalities in CVD. The primary aims will examine how neighborhood social characteristics (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), social disintegration, socioeconomic and ethnic segregation, social capital), physical environments (e.g., geocoded assets including goods and services contributing to health such as educational and recreational resources; barriers to health including pollution, industries, waste dumps, criminal activity, alcohol and fast food outlets) and individual factors (e.g., SES, CVD risk factors, country of birth and social networks) may interrelate to predict CVD [morbidity and mortality] and all-cause mortality.  Design/methods: We will use data from a newly created, comprehensive set of Swedish databases, MigMed and MigSALLS. MigMed (1990-2002) includes data for the entire Swedish population of 6 million women and men aged 25 and older, of whom 600,000 are first generation immigrants. Their addresses have been geocoded, yielding 9,677 neighborhoods, which will be reduced to a smaller number of defined units by cluster analyses. MigMed includes an annual assessment of individual-level sociodemographic and health indicators. We will also analyze data from MigSALLS (1988-2002), which includes more in-depth data from face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of approximately 18,000 women and men aged 25-74, of whom 2,000 are first generation immigrants. MigSALLS contains similar individual- and neighborhood-level factors as MigMed, as well as extensive information on factors that may mediate relationships between neighborhoods and CVD outcomes (e.g., CVD risk factors such as smoking, weight, physical activity, and blood pressure). Information from these two datasets will be matched to hospital and death records (300,000 deaths and 140,000 incidence cases of CVD expected between 1988-2002), thus creating one of the largest databases in the world involving men and women from diverse SES levels and countries of origin.

"STRESS REDUCTION AND ATHEROSCLEROTIC CVD IN BLACKS The President's Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities Initiative of 1998 emphasizes that African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans.  Numerous controlled studies suggest that this disparity is associated with chronic psychosocial and environmental stress.  For these reasons, the NHLBI Working Group on Research in Coronary Heart Disease in Blacks has mandated behavior and prevention in this minority population as a national research priority. Our research team has previously demonstrated in NHLBI-supported randomized controlled trials that hypertension can be effectively treated in high risk African Americans with stress reduction using the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program compared to control procedures.  These and other studies have also reported clinically significant improvements in other CVD risk factors, psychosocial stress, myocardial ischemia, left ventricular mass and mortality rates from CVD and all-causes in high risk subjects randomized to active stress reduction. Preliminary findings from our recently completed, NHLBI-supported clinical trial of stress reduction in the prevention of hypertensive heart disease in inner city African Americans has indicated that atherosclerotic CVD, assessed by carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT), significantly regresses after eight months of active stress reduction intervention compared to control education.  These results were comparable to effects of lipid lowering therapies or extensive lifestyle modification. This proposed continuation project will extend these findings by investigating the effectiveness of active stress reduction in the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD in African Americans. This five year study will be a randomized, single-blind, controlled, community-based trial involving 184 African American subjects with known coronary heart disease.  Male and female subjects will be enrolled at our on-going field site, Martin Luther King-Drew Medical Center in inner city Los Angeles.  After baseline testing, subjects will be randomized to either active stress reduction with TM or health education control-both in addition to usual medical care-and posttested after 12 months. The primary outcome will be carotid artery atherosclerosis (IMT) measured non-invasively by quantitative B-mode ultrasonography. Secondary measures will include traditional CVD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, smoking, exercise), psychosocial stress, quality of life and cost effectiveness.  The results of this clinical trial will yield valuable new knowledge for the prevention of CVD through behavioral means in high risk African Americans.

"Stanford MKITS Science Program: CVD and Public Health DESCRIPTION  (provided by applicant): Background:  Only 0.5% of Native American, 16% of Latino, and 21% of African American high school graduates earn a college degree compared with 37% of White students, resulting in a critical shortage of underrepresented ethnic minorities in scientific and health careers.  Partners:  A partnership has been formed between an internationally renowned research program in cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemiology at Stanford and science teachers from four California high schools.  Each school population is either predominantly rural Native American, rural Latino, urban Latino, or urban African American.  Curriculum:  We will develop and evaluate a curriculum focused on CVD, the scientific process, health disparities, health careers, and the college admissions process.  The major components of our program are school-based:  1) an academic-year science program for all interested juniors (10-25 students from each school for a total of 80 per year); and Stanford-based:  2) a one-day CVD and college guidance workshop each year for all science program students and their guidance counselors and parents; 3) a five-week CVD Summer Institute for selected science program students (about 5 students from each school for a total of 20 per year who will return to their schools as seniors to be teaching assistants); and 4) a one-week CVD Summer Institute for science teachers (1-3 teachers from each school for about 8 per year).  During the program, we will train 320 students overall and 100 students   intensively.  Focus:  The curriculum for both students and teachers will have a broad focus on CVD and public health.  It will be distinguished by:  hands-on CVD science demonstrations; community-based, culturally-relevant group research projects; interactions with biomedical research scientists; hospital and clinical field placements in the community and at Stanford; strong mentoring from Stanford faculty and students; individualized college and career guidance; technology training; and long-term student and institutional support.  Evaluation:  We will use process and outcome evaluation to assess teacher training, the curriculum implementation, student engagement in and knowledge about the scientific process, number of students entering college and scientific professions, and dissemination and sustainability of the program.  We will follow all students annually through college graduation and beyond using a telephone survey to provide long-term support and evaluate the numbers pursuing science majors in college and entering scientific and health careers.  Our new program will build on our highly successful 15-year-old summer academic enrichment program that has reached 333 low-income high school students.  Over 90% have been followed for up to 15 years; almost 100% have entered college.  Among college graduates, 11% are in or have completed medical school, 32% are in or have completed graduate school, 21% are employed in health careers, and 22% are employed in non-health jobs.

"Autonomic function/insulin resistance/multiethnic pop.    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Autonomic nervous system regulation of heartbeat variability is often disrupted among patients with diabetes.  Moreover, reduced heart rate variability has been associated with increased Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) mortality among diabetic and non-diabetic populations.  CVD mortality rates differ greatly among many ethnic groups.  In Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have been shown to have disproportionately higher CVD mortality than Asian and Caucasian groups.  Preliminary data from the Native Hawaiian Health Research Project suggest that conventional risk factors associated with Atherosclerosis may not fully account for ethnic disparities in heart disease and stroke mortality rates in Hawaii.  Insulin resistance has been associated with increased CVD incidence and mortality, and has also been associated with reduced heart rate variability.  The proposed study will investigate the relationship between insulin resistance and autonomic regulation of cardiac function in a multi-ethnic population.  The proposed research will also provide baseline data for future longitudinal studies that will investigate the extent to which these novel risk factors explain ethnic disparities in CVD mortality in Hawaii.  The findings of the proposed study may have important implications with regards to the treatment of insulin resistance as an independent CVD risk factor.      Specific Aims:  Collaborator component (Aim #1).  Establish a collaborative laboratory in Hawaii for the evaluation of autonomic function in a multiethnic population.  Principal Investigator component (Aim #2).  Investigate the relationship between insulin resistance, body-fat distribution, and autonomic function.  (Aim #3) Establish a cohort with baseline measures of autonomic function and insulin resistance that will serve as a study population for R01-supported longitudinal studies.  Hypotheses:  By fulfilling these specific aims, we propose to test the following specific research hypotheses:  (1.) Autonomic function will differ significantly by ethnicity, after adjustment for age, gender, body-mass index, and central obesity.  (2.) Insulin resistance is independently associated with autonomic function, after an adjustment for age, gender, body-mass index, and central obesity.  Secondary Questions:  Does insulin resistance and plasma glucose interact, in their effects on autonomic function?

"Cardiovascular Disease Trends in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the recognition of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a leading cause of mortality, this country lacks a cohesive, informative surveillance system that can provide insights into national patterns of care, reveal national trends over time, and track short- and long-term patient outcomes for elderly Americans. Most national estimates of CVD and outcomes have been based on extrapolating rates from a very small number of community studies or clinical studies that are restricted in terms of size, demographics, or geography. In addition, outcome measures have most often been limited to recurrent disease or death, and typically consider short-term outcomes (rarely beyond 12 to 24 months). Related vascular events and nonvascular events are rarely considered. This has resulted in significant data gaps. Defining patterns and trends of CVD, and identifying differences and disparities among diverse groups in terms of age, race, gender, clinical history, as well as different geographic regions of the United States should be a top research priority. We have created a population-based national cohort that will begin to fill these gaps in knowledge. The Cardiovascular Disease Trends in the Elderly Study will span 12 years and include all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries discharged with CVD from 1991 through 2003. Accordingly, this study has the following specific aims: (1) Determine 12-year cardiovascular disease trends, especially by age, race, and gender subgroups, as well as region; (2) determine the short- and long-term outcomes for patients hospitalized with cardiovascular disease; and (3) determine the change in cost and outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries. This career development award will enable the candidate to build additional skills to link the complementary disciplines of clinical medicine, epidemiology, public health, biostatistics, and health economics to examine the burden of cardiovascular disease in the elderly. This unique perspective will provide valuable insights for policy makers and investigators in planning for the health care needs of patients with established cardiovascular disease.

"Heart Failure Disparities in Native Hawaiians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem leading to considerable cardiovascular morbidity &  mortality.  The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.  Partners of the HFD Program include:  MedStar Research Institute, Oahu-based Community Health Centers (CHCs) & the Hawaii EXPORT Center, an NIH-funded initiative addressing diabetes-associated disparities in NH/PP.  The HFD Program will achieve the following research & educational aims:  1) Determine the reliability & validity of echocardiograms performed by community-based health workers compared to a professionally trained sonographer as the ""gold standard"".  2) Determine if a culturally competent educational program for heart failure reduces HF hospitalizations & mortality compared to usual care.  3) Characterize ethnic differences in the heart failure syndrome in hospitalized NHs & PPs compared to Caucasians.  4) Construct HF pedigrees using probands identified at the QEC for a future HF linkage study in NHs & PPs.  5) Educate community-based health workers to perform echocardiography scans for the detection of HF in a high risk population of NHs & PPs.  6) Train new investigators to conduct research focused on CVD disparities in general, and heart failure in particular.  By achieving these aims, the HFD Program will improve access to HF care at CHCs that serve NHs & PPs, fill a gap in knowledge of CVD disparities in NHs & PPs and provide a foundation for future studies on genetic determinants of HF.

"LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD PREDICTORS OF CVD  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: There are few comprehensive databases that allow for a longitudinal examination of how neighborhood-level factors may interact with individual characteristics to predict incident cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.   Primary Aims: This cross-institutional project joins investigators from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Stanford University, known for their expertise in immigrant health and social inequalities in CVD. The primary aims will examine how neighborhood social characteristics (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), social disintegration, socioeconomic and ethnic segregation, social capital), physical environments (e.g., geocoded assets including goods and services contributing to health such as educational and recreational resources; barriers to health including pollution, industries, waste dumps, criminal activity, alcohol and fast food outlets) and individual factors (e.g., SES, CVD risk factors, country of birth and social networks) may interrelate to predict CVD [morbidity and mortality] and all-cause mortality.  Design/methods: We will use data from a newly created, comprehensive set of Swedish databases, MigMed and MigSALLS. MigMed (1990-2002) includes data for the entire Swedish population of 6 million women and men aged 25 and older, of whom 600,000 are first generation immigrants. Their addresses have been geocoded, yielding 9,677 neighborhoods, which will be reduced to a smaller number of defined units by cluster analyses. MigMed includes an annual assessment of individual-level sociodemographic and health indicators. We will also analyze data from MigSALLS (1988-2002), which includes more in-depth data from face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of approximately 18,000 women and men aged 25-74, of whom 2,000 are first generation immigrants. MigSALLS contains similar individual- and neighborhood-level factors as MigMed, as well as extensive information on factors that may mediate relationships between neighborhoods and CVD outcomes (e.g., CVD risk factors such as smoking, weight, physical activity, and blood pressure). Information from these two datasets will be matched to hospital and death records (300,000 deaths and 140,000 incidence cases of CVD expected between 1988-2002), thus creating one of the largest databases in the world involving men and women from diverse SES levels and countries of origin.   Dissemination: We will integrate our findings with existing knowledge on neighborhood influences on health, and disseminate results through our strong collaborations with public health practitioners and the lay community using seminars, the internet, and other mass media.

"Physical Activity as a Function of Neighborhood Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality are well recognized between African and European Americans, but the reasons are not well understood. Multiple individual and community variables are imputed in the causal pathway. Physical inactivity has been identified as an independent risk factor for CVD, as well as other chronic diseases. Numerous studies have revealed lower levels of physical activity in minorities, women, and lower socioeconomic groups, which may be a factor in the disparity, although most have measured only one dimension of physical activity, leisure time activity, in a relatively short time frame. Little is known about the range of physical activity, including the moderate level of activity gained in activities of daily living. Additionally, because individuals live and interact within social and political communities, discerning the contextual influence of their neighborhoods and communities is crucial to understanding CVD health disparities.  This study uses a non-experimental, social epidemiologic perspective to examine two dimensions of physical activity within the social and geographic context of participant's lives. Geocoding of participant data using geographic information systems and hierarchical linear modeling will be used to examine the relationship and effect of individual and contextual factors on the health behavior, physical activity.

There is clear evidence of a strong association        between socioeconomic status (SES), economic development, and cardiovascular         disease (CVD), the largest contributor to all-cause mortality in the U.S.  The       pathways linking these social and economic inequalities to health are not yet        well understood.

"Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetic Nephropathy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Hispanics are the largest ethnic minority group in the country and MA constitute almost 80% of Hispanics in California.  MA have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and a higher risk for diabetic nephropathy (DN).  Paradoxically, data including our own suggest that CVD burden may be lower in MA than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW).  We seek to define the CVD burden (coronary artery calcification, CAC) and its determinants in a high-risk sub-group of non-dialyzed diabetics with DN (125 MA, 125 NHW), in order to test three hypotheses:  1) Among individuals with DN, the CAC scores in MA are lower and progress more slowly, than among NHW; 2) The socioeconomic status (SES) of MA individuals with DN is significantly lower than of NHW; and 3) Among individuals with DN, MA have a lower all-cause and CVD mortality.  Ten routinely measured, two additional CVD risk factors (homocysteine, leptin) and three SES variables, pre-specified for primary analyses, will be ascertained at baseline, 12 and 24 months.  CAC will be ascertained by electron beam computerized tomography at baseline and 24 months.  The relationship of CVD risk factors and SES variables that vary by ethnicity will be tested for their contribution to ethnic differences in CAC.  The entire cohort will be followed from enrollment till the end of the grant period to ascertain ethnic differences in all-cause and CVD mortality; a high event rate in this population provides power to test the hypotheses thus proposed.  A rigorous plan for complete follow-up is proposed.  Thus, this study will define for the first time the comparative atherosclerotic burden in MA and NHW with DN and the potential role of several CVD risk factors.  It will test the novel hypothesis that despite medical and SES factors that might increase the risk for CVD mortality in MA, the opposite may be true.  Identifying health-care disparities will permit us to design targeted interventions to improve the health of ethnic minorities.  Recognition of factors associated with the lower CVD risk among MA or the higher risk among NHW may help develop therapies that may potentially reduce the CVD burden among patients with DN.

"The HHER Lifestyle Program for CVD Risk Reduction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for women in the United States, claiming more lives each year than all cancers combined. CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality rates are significantly higher in African American (AA) women than in white women. Health care sites are excellent settings in which to counsel individuals regarding CVD risk reduction. Few studies to date, however, have tested the effectiveness of health care-based interventions with AA women or financially disadvantaged populations. The overall goal of this study, the Heart Healthy and Ethnically Relevant (HHER) Lifestyle Program, is to advance our understanding of how to effectively promote CVD risk reduction in health care settings among financially disadvantaged AA women ages 35 years and older. The proposed randomized clinical trial builds on recently completed formative and feasibility studies conducted by the investigators. We propose to train primary care providers to deliver brief tailored [based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM)] behavioral counseling with nurse assisted goal setting. Patients of providers will be randomly assigned to intervention or standard care. Patients in the intervention condition (n=156) will receive a comprehensive, theory-based intervention that includes tailored provider-delivered counseling and goal-setting at baseline and at routine clinic visits, a community resource guide, a monthly newsletter and monthly telephone counseling. The standard care condition (n=156) will receive tailored provider-delivered counseling and goal-setting at baseline with generic health education materials on diet and PA and a community resource guide. A social ecological model will be used to conceptualize the intervention, and social cognitive theory and the TTM will guide the intervention targets and techniques.

"The Emory-Morehouse Partnership to Reduce CV Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Over the past decade, there has been an explosive increase in obesity among all age groups within the US population.  This epidemic is particularly problematic among African-Americans in the Southeast. Although genetic factors play a contributory role, it is postulated that ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) is related to a dynamic interplay between biological factors and the behavioral response to the unique environmental context within ethnic communities. Obesity is often associated with perturbations in the metabolic and physiologic milieu.  A cluster of obesity-related abnormalities has been defined as the ""Metabolic Syndrome"".  The CVD complications of obesity appears to be related to the capacity for adipose tissue itself to generate ""adipokines"" that   directly predispose to insulin-resistance, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and vascular disease. The proposed program will use state-of-the-art approaches to define potential ethnic differences in the profile of metabolic, physiologic and biochemical features associated with obesity as well as the salutary responses to lifestyle modification.  The proposed program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize potential ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD by drawing upon the fields of psychology, physiology, biochemistry, nursing and clinical medicine.  In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's research plan ranges from:  epidemiology studies within the ethnic communities, to patient-centered clinical trial interventions within ethnic community practices, tothe analysis of novel biomarkers of human pathobiology.  This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between the Morehouse School of Medicine and Emory University.  This partnership shares a joint commitment to address the striking ethnic disparities in the high-risk CVD population that we serve.  The specific aims are:  Aim 1:  Define the relative influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort.  Aim 2:  Define the effectiveness of patient-targeted behavioral interventions to enhance the health of African-American patients with the   Metabolic Syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices.  Aim 3:  To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans.  Aim 4:  To enhance the education/training of fellows/practitioners engaged in CVD disparities research/practice and promote partnerships that enhance cardiovascular health within ethnic communities.

"Morehouse-Emory Partnership to Reduce CV  Disparities The explosive epidemic of obesity that has occurred over the past decade has affected all segments of the population; but has had its most detrimental impact on high-risk ethnic populations. Despite the compelling evidence that obesity increases the risk of CVD mortality, the pathobiological pathways that mediate this increased risk remain to be further elucidated. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has recently been defined to capture the cluster of characteristics associated with obesity and high CVD risk. We are intrigued by the paradoxical observation that African-Americans (AA) have a lower prevalence of the MetS compared to whites despite a higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension. This observation suggests that current clinical criteria fail to identify obese AA at high risk for CVD. Further research in ethnic populations is necessary to guide more effective preventive interventions. It is postulated that ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD involve a complex interplay between behavioral, cultural, socio-economic and biological determinants. The theme of this Morehouse-Emory Partnership Program focuses on elucidating the etiologic basis of ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and discovering new intervention strategies to ameliorate CV health in all communities. The proposed Program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and develop effective therapeutic interventions by drawing upon the fields of physiology, biochemistry, vascular biology, psychology, public health, nursing and clinical medicine. In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's approach to elucidating ethnic disparities integrates the analysis of psycho-social parameters within the context of ethnic communities with the assessment of novel biomarkers and !assays of vascular function/structure that characterize differences in pathobiological pathways. This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between Emory University and the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM). In accordance with the RFA, the Program has at least four research-specific and two training-specific aims within Projects the subprojectsI and the shared resource Cores.

"ALEXANDER CENTER FOR CAM, MINORITY AGING AND CVD Older African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of morbidity, mortality, and disability compared to older white Americans. The largest contributor to this health disparity is cardiovascular disease (CVD) in this population. Therefore, in accordance with national research priority mandates, the overall goal of the Alexander Center for Research in CAM, Minority Aging and CVD is to evaluate the efficacy is to evaluate the efficacy and mechanisms of CAM approaches for the prevention of this epidemic disease in older African Americans. The Alexander Center is a unique interdisciplinary and multi-institutional collaboration of leading academic and clinical centers in CAM and conventional medicine. These partner institutions have an established record of collaborating together on NIH-supported randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness and mechanisms of CAM modalities, specifically in older African Americans at high risk for CVD. The participating institutions include: Maharishi University of Management- College of Maharishi Vedic Medicine, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Charles R. Drew University of Medicine, Morehouse School of Medicine and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Preliminary studies conducted by the present team have found that approaches of traditional Vedic medicine, in particular meditation intervention, is associated with significant reductions in hypertension, psychosocial stress, surrogate endpoints for atherosclerotic CVD and hypertensive-heart disease, and mortality over long-term follow-up in this aging minority population. Therefore, the Center will conduct well-controlled basic and clinical research, developmental programs, research training, and establish core services, administrative structures and procedures to support this research program. Proposed research programs with older high risk African American populations and cores include: 1) a basic study of mechanisms of meditation on atherosclerotic CVD (arterial vasomotion, cardiac autonomic tone and psychosocial risk factors), 2) a clinical trial of effects of meditation on carotid atherosclerosis, CVD risk factors, physiological mechanisms, psychosocial risk factors and quality of life in older Black women with CVD, 3) a controlled study on mechanisms and clinical effects of a traditional herbal antioxidant compared to conventional vitamin supplementation on carotid atherosclerosis, endothelial function, oxidative stress, CVD risk factors, and quality of life, 4) an Administrative Core to provide organizational structure and procedures, an overall Advisory Council, training of graduate and postgraduate CAM researchers and future developmental studies, 5) a Biostatistical and Research Methods Core that will provide statistical and methodological support for research projects.

"STRESS REDUCTION AND CVD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN BLACKS-II DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans. Substantial evidence indicates that high levels of psychosocial and socioenvironmental stress contribute to the excessive morbidity and mortality in this population. In earlier controlled trials with African Americans and other populations at high risk for CVD, the current collaborative team demonstrated that a selected stress reduction approach, the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program, was associated with significant reductions in CVD risk factors and surrogate markers for clinical CVD. These include clinically significant decreases in hypertension, myocardial ischemia and carotid atherosclerosis, as well as improvements in psychosocial stress and quality of life. In the previous NHLBI-sponsored clinical trial, 201 African American men and women with documented coronary heart disease (mean age 59 years) were randomized to either stress reduction with the TM program or a health education control. The results showed 50 percent lower risk of combined mortality and CVD morbidity in the stress reduction group compared to control (RR = .50, p <.05) after a median three year follow-up period. Preliminary analysis, in preparation for the proposed study, suggests lower risk of ""hard"" events alone--mortality, MI and stroke (RR= .42; p = .15).  The proposed study will conduct long-term follow-up of intervention and testing of the previous trial of 201 African American participants for an additional five funded years. This study will definitively evaluate long-term effects of behavioral stress reduction compared to control on ""hard"" CVD endpoints and sustainability of disease-free survival on combined ""hard"" and ""soft"" CVD endpoints (all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, coronary revascularizations, and hospitalizations for heart failure and ischemic heart disease, non-MI). Secondary outcomes will include traditional CVD risk factors (BP, lipids, diet, exercise, weight), psychosocial risk factors (depression, hostility, anger), quality of life, medication use, compliance, and cost effectiveness. To our knowledge, this is the only randomized controlled trial of behavioral stress reduction for the secondary prevention of CVD in African American men and women. The results of this unique long-term study will contribute critical new knowledge for the elimination of racial and ethnic diparities in health.

"Cardiovascular Care Disparities: Safety-Net HIT Strategy DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  The delivery of healthcare to the indigent, minority, and disadvantaged populations represents at once Louisiana's greatest burden and its greatest opportunity.  The 70-year-old Charity safety-net system, now administratively run as the LSU Health Sciences Center (LSUHSC) Health Care Services Division (HCSD), encompasses an eight-hospital, 360-clinic network that cares for almost 850,000 patients.  Despite delivering some of the highest quality care in Louisiana, the only financial option for the HCSD is to improve efficiencies of care.  Incorporation of health information technology (HIT) to address errors, quality, and value is critical; importantly, system-wide administrative, financial, laboratory, and telemedicine HIT infrastructure already exists on which to build a clinical data system.  We are focusing on cardiovascular disease (CVD) care in this THQIT application.  Using the existing clinical partnership between LSUHSC, the HCSD, and the Tulane School of Medicine embodied in the Charity system, we are bringing together the Tulane Department of Health Systems Management (financial outcomes and effectiveness of care), a leading CVD software company (system architecture; clinical and financial data concatenation; ARMUS Corporation), the Louisiana Office of Public Health (LA Healthy People 2010 initiative), and outside expert CVD consultants (longitudinal CVD database design;) for this THQIT Partnership.  We will plan the design and implementation of a longitudinal CVD information system (LCIS) platform to address disparities in CVD viewed as a lifelong disease process.  We will be able to scientifically validate the impact of this HIT effort on quality improvement, medical and financial effectiveness, and increased value.  We can create this LCIS in a setting where all the stakeholders have aligned financial incentives.  Moreover, the population's extent of disease will magnify the program's impact on health services and clinical research.  Finally, endorsement of this HIT effort by this planning grant will leverage LCIS implementation funding, a step that is critical for the HCSD's survival.

"Heart Failure Disparities in Native Hawaiians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem leading to considerable cardiovascular morbidity &  mortality.  The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.  Partners of the HFD Program include:  MedStar Research Institute, Oahu-based Community Health Centers (CHCs) & the Hawaii EXPORT Center, an NIH-funded initiative addressing diabetes-associated disparities in NH/PP.  The HFD Program will achieve the following research & educational aims:  1) Determine the reliability & validity of echocardiograms performed by community-based health workers compared to a professionally trained sonographer as the ""gold standard"".  2) Determine if a culturally competent educational program for heart failure reduces HF hospitalizations & mortality compared to usual care.  3) Characterize ethnic differences in the heart failure syndrome in hospitalized NHs & PPs compared to Caucasians.  4) Construct HF pedigrees using probands identified at the QEC for a future HF linkage study in NHs & PPs.  5) Educate community-based health workers to perform echocardiography scans for the detection of HF in a high risk population of NHs & PPs.  6) Train new investigators to conduct  research focused on CVD disparities in general, and heart failure in particular.  By achieving these aims, the HFD Program will improve access to HF care at CHCs that serve NHs & PPs, fill a gap in knowledge of CVD disparities in NHs & PPs and provide a foundation for future studies on genetic determinants of HF.

"Wounded Spirits, Ailing Hearts: PTSD and CVD in Indians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a unique psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction resulting from exposure to a stressful traumatic event(s). In the United States general population PTSD has a lifetime prevalence of 5 percent in men and 10 percent in women. PTSD is known to produce alternations in the central and autonomic nervous system and hormonal dysregulation. However, little is known about the long-term consequences of PTSD on the cardiovascular system. PTSD is a common disorder among reservation-dwelling American Indians (AIs) with a life-time prevalence of 12 percent in men and 23 percent in women. Similarly, cardiovascular disease (CVD), has emerged as a major health problem in AIs during the past decade. We propose to examine the relationship between PTSD and cardiac function in a population-based sample of AIs. The technical aims of this study involve: 1) the identification of AI men and women ages 18-52 who have a lifetime history of PTSD and are free from overt CVD; 2) the selection of an age-, sex-, and tribe-matched comparison group of AIs who have no history of PTSD and are free from known CVD; 3) a comprehensive lifestyle and clinical evaluation of the PTSD and non-PTSD groups to assess CVD risk factors such as smoking, exercise, obesity, blood pressure, concentrations of blood lipids, and inflammatory and thrombogenic factors; and 4) a set of non-invasive tests of subclinical CVD and other measures of CVD risk. These tests include positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging to examine coronary flow reserve, high-resolution ultrasound of the carotid arteries to measure carotid intima-media thickness, high-resolution ultrasound of the brachial artery to determine flow-mediated vasodilation, and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, to assess heart rate vadability (HRV). With these data, we will address our scientific aims, which are: 1) to determine whether individuals with PTSD, compared with those without PTSD, show greater evidence of subclinical CVD, including a lower coronary flow reserve, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and reduced forearm flow-mediated vasodilation; 2) to ascertain whether HRV is lower in individuals with PTSD compared to those without PTSD; and 3) to investigate the role of lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, exercise, obesity), cultural (e.g., acculturation, religiosity), and biological (e.g., blood pressure, blood lipid and glucose concentrations) mediators in the relationship of PTSD with coronary flow reserve and HRV. Since the emerging epidemic of CVD in AIs cannot be completely explained by changes in traditional risk factors, there is an urgent need to identify novel risk factors, like PTSD. Furthermore, the description of the influence of PTSD on the cardiovascular system could have immediate clinical and public health implications. Strategies for preventing PTSD, initiation of early treatment, and the identification of factors that mediate its potentially cardio-toxic effects could reduce morbidity and mortality from CVD.

"LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF NEIGHBORHOOD PREDICTORS OF CVD  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background: There are few comprehensive databases that allow for a longitudinal examination of how neighborhood-level factors may interact with individual characteristics to predict incident cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality.   Primary Aims: This cross-institutional project joins investigators from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Stanford University, known for their expertise in immigrant health and social inequalities in CVD. The primary aims will examine how neighborhood social characteristics (e.g., neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), social disintegration, socioeconomic and ethnic segregation, social capital), physical environments (e.g., geocoded assets including goods and services contributing to health such as educational and recreational resources; barriers to health including pollution, industries, waste dumps, criminal activity, alcohol and fast food outlets) and individual factors (e.g., SES, CVD risk factors, country of birth and social networks) may interrelate to predict CVD [morbidity and mortality] and all-cause mortality.  Design/methods: We will use data from a newly created, comprehensive set of Swedish databases, MigMed and MigSALLS. MigMed (1990-2002) includes data for the entire Swedish population of 6 million women and men aged 25 and older, of whom 600,000 are first generation immigrants. Their addresses have been geocoded, yielding 9,677 neighborhoods, which will be reduced to a smaller number of defined units by cluster analyses. MigMed includes an annual assessment of individual-level sociodemographic and health indicators. We will also analyze data from MigSALLS (1988-2002), which includes more in-depth data from face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of approximately 18,000 women and men aged 25-74, of whom 2,000 are first generation immigrants. MigSALLS contains similar individual- and neighborhood-level factors as MigMed, as well as extensive information on factors that may mediate relationships between neighborhoods and CVD outcomes (e.g., CVD risk factors such as smoking, weight, physical activity, and blood pressure). Information from these two datasets will be matched to hospital and death records (300,000 deaths and 140,000 incidence cases of CVD expected between 1988-2002), thus creating one of the largest databases in the world involving men and women from diverse SES levels and countries of origin.   Dissemination: We will integrate our findings with existing knowledge on neighborhood influences on health, and disseminate results through our strong collaborations with public health practitioners and the lay community using seminars, the internet, and other mass media.

"Poverty, Stress and Cardiovascular Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older women of low socioeconomic status (SES) have higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than older women of high SES. This difference, a source of disparity in mortality and disability, is not explained by traditional CVD risk factors. Despite recent policy emphasis on health disparities, the Contributing biological mechanisms are largely unspecified. Differential stress experience between SES groups could affect CVD disparities. Allostatic load is a single parameter that represents the sum of multiple body system indicators and is theorized to be a cumulative measure of stress-related biological risk. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that allostatic load is a mediator between SES and incident CVD in a population of older women. The study will use data from the Women's Health and Aging Study 2, a 10 year longitudinal study of 436 women aged 70-79 years old at baseline. The socioeconomic diversity of the subjects and the range of biological data provided are ideal to test the candidate's hypotheses.

"Physical Activity as a Function of Neighborhood Context DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality are well recognized between African and European Americans, but the reasons are not well understood. Multiple individual and community variables are imputed in the causal pathway. Physical inactivity has been identified as an independent risk factor for CVD, as well as other chronic diseases. Numerous studies have revealed lower levels of physical activity in minorities, women, and lower socioeconomic groups, which may be a factor in the disparity, although most have measured only one dimension of physical activity, leisure time activity, in a relatively short time frame. Little is known about the range of physical activity, including the moderate level of activity gained in activities of daily living. Additionally, because individuals live and interact within social and political communities, discerning the contextual influence of their neighborhoods and communities is crucial to understanding CVD health disparities.  This study uses a non-experimental, social epidemiologic perspective to examine two dimensions of physical activity within the social and geographic context of participant's lives. Geocoding of participant data using geographic information systems and hierarchical linear modeling will be used to examine the relationship and effect of individual and contextual factors on the health behavior, physical activity.

"Reducing Total Cardiovascular Risk in an Urban Community The proposed study is based on the premise that a community based participatory research partnership model using a team of an advanced practice nurse case manager, community health worker (CHW), and physician can be translated into urban community clinics and improve the quality of care and reduce disparities in cardiovascular health in minority and other underserved populations. Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of CVD risk-reducing practices remains poor. In spite of the known benefit of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dl in persons with existing heart disease, as many as 50-70% of eligible CVD patients are not placed on lipid-lowering therapy by their providers and from 20-80% of patients do not achieve the goals of therapy. The benefits of controlling high blood pressure (HBP) are well established yet national rates of HBP control remain at only 3 1% despite decades of provider and patient education. In addition, it is well established that control of glycemia, hyperlipidemia, and blood pressure reduce the risk of vascular complications in people with diabetes, 75% of whom die from some form of heart or blood vessel disease. This randomized trial will compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive intensive intervention (Cl) with a less intensive intervention (LI) in African American (AA), and White low income patients with known excessive CVD risk. A total of 500 eligible patients with CVD or type 2 diabetes (250 AA and 250 White) will be randomly selected from two urban federally-funded community clinics and randomly assigned to receive either 1) a Cl delivered by a nurse practitioner, a CHW, and the patient's physician, focusing on behavioral interventions to affect therapeutic lifestyle changes and medication adherence as well as the prescription and titration of medications or 2) a LI intervention providing feedback on CVD risk factors and guidelines to patients and their physicians. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, one and two years. It is hypothesized that a higher proportion of patients in the Cl group will achieve the treatment goals for lipid, blood pressure, and diabetes management, lifestyle behaviors and utilization of antiplatelet agent, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor therapies and that the Cl intervention wilj be cost-effective. Secondary outcomes include assessment of the impact of the Cl model on patients' satisfaction with care and health care utilization. The proposed increase in the percentage of high-risk women and men who receive recommended secondary prevention therapies and achieve goal levels could potentially result in a marked decrement in annual CVD mortality and health disparities if applied within primary care settings to populations with the characteristics of the target groups for this study.

"Heart Failure Disparities in Native Hawaiians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem leading to considerable cardiovascular morbidity &  mortality.  The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.  Partners of the HFD Program include:  MedStar Research Institute, Oahu-based Community Health Centers (CHCs) & the Hawaii EXPORT Center, an NIH-funded initiative addressing diabetes-associated disparities in NH/PP.  The HFD Program will achieve the following research & educational aims:  1) Determine the reliability & validity of echocardiograms performed by community-based health workers compared to a professionally trained sonographer as the ""gold standard"".  2) Determine if a culturally competent educational program for heart failure reduces HF hospitalizations & mortality compared to usual care.  3) Characterize ethnic differences in the heart failure syndrome in hospitalized NHs & PPs compared to Caucasians.  4) Construct HF pedigrees using probands identified at the QEC for a future HF linkage study in NHs & PPs.  5) Educate community-based health workers to perform echocardiography scans for the detection of HF in a high risk population of NHs & PPs.  6) Train new investigators to conduct research focused on CVD disparities in general, and heart failure in particular.  By achieving these aims, the HFD Program will improve access to HF care at CHCs that serve NHs & PPs, fill a gap in knowledge of CVD disparities in NHs & PPs and provide a foundation for future studies on genetic determinants of HF.

"Stanford MKITS Science Program: CVD and Public Health DESCRIPTION  (provided by applicant): Background:  Only 0.5% of Native American, 16% of Latino, and 21% of African American high school graduates earn a college degree compared with 37% of White students, resulting in a critical shortage of underrepresented ethnic minorities in scientific and health careers.  Partners:  A partnership has been formed between an internationally renowned research program in cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemiology at Stanford and science teachers from four California high schools.  Each school population is either predominantly rural Native American, rural Latino, urban Latino, or urban African American.  Curriculum:  We will develop and evaluate a curriculum focused on CVD, the scientific process, health disparities, health careers, and the college admissions process.  The major components of our program are school-based:  1) an academic-year science program for all interested juniors (10-25 students from each school for a total of 80 per year); and Stanford-based:  2) a one-day CVD and college guidance workshop each year for all science program students and their guidance counselors and parents; 3) a five-week CVD Summer Institute for selected science program students (about 5 students from each school for a total of 20 per year who will return to their schools as seniors to be teaching assistants); and 4) a one-week CVD Summer Institute for science teachers (1-3 teachers from each school for about 8 per year).  During the program, we will train 320 students overall and 100 students   intensively.  Focus:  The curriculum for both students and teachers will have a broad focus on CVD and public health.  It will be distinguished by:  hands-on CVD science demonstrations; community-based, culturally-relevant group research projects; interactions with biomedical research scientists; hospital and clinical field placements in the community and at Stanford; strong mentoring from Stanford faculty and students; individualized college and career guidance; technology training; and long-term student and institutional support.  Evaluation:  We will use process and outcome evaluation to assess teacher training, the curriculum implementation, student engagement in and knowledge about the scientific process, number of students entering college and scientific professions, and dissemination and sustainability of the program.  We will follow all students annually through college graduation and beyond using a telephone survey to provide long-term support and evaluate the numbers pursuing science majors in college and entering scientific and health careers.  Our new program will build on our highly successful 15-year-old summer academic enrichment program that has reached 333 low-income high school students.  Over 90% have been followed for up to 15 years; almost 100% have entered college.  Among college graduates, 11% are in or have completed medical school, 32% are in or have completed graduate school, 21% are employed in health careers, and 22% are employed in non-health jobs.

"Project AsPIRE (Asian American Partnerships in Research)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this three-year planning grant is to improve health access and status for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Filipino Americans living in the New York City metropolitan area through the use of patient navigators. This application has four specific aims: (1) to create an infrastructure that facilitates the conduct of community-based participatory research (CBPR), (2) to conduct a descriptive study that examines the Filipino American community's knowledge, health practices, health access, and risk factors for CVD, (3) to conduct an experimental study to assess the efficacy of an intensive patient navigator intervention in improving health access and status for CVD among Filipino Americans, and (4) to evaluate CBPR as an approach for addressing and eliminating health disparities. Year 1 focuses on partnership development and creation, with community participation, of a patient navigator intervention to improve hypertension control in Filipino Americans.  The Kalusugan (i.e., ""health"" in Pilipino) Coalition-comprised of academic and community partners serving the Filipino American community-has met since 2004.  A community advisory board and seven taskforces comprised of Coalition members will be created and meet during Year 1.  Years 2 and 3 implement a pilot intervention to test the efficacy of the patient navigator intervention.  A randomized controlled trial will be conducted.  Filipino American men and women ages 25-55 identified as hypertensive during community screenings will be randomized into a more intensive (n = 108) and less intensive (n = 108) patient navigator intervention.  The more intensive intervention will provide six protocolized sessions conducted by patient navigators; guided by the Health Belief Model and social support theory, sessions will focus on (a) providing information on high blood pressure and CVD, (b) linking and negotiating access to a primary care physician, (c) providing social support, and (d) assuring adherence to medication taking and appointment keeping.  A baseline and two follow-up interviews will be conducted to assess client outcomes, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and adherence to medication taking and appointment keeping. RELEVANCE: Filipino Americans exhibit high rates of hypertension and are therefore at high risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke.  However, few interventions have been developed and implemented for this population to address these concerns.  A patient navigator intervention, developed with community input to ensure its cultural and linguistic appropriateness, has the potential to prevent cardiovascular disease and stroke by helping Filipino Americans control their blood pressure.         ",Project AsPIRE (Asian American Partnerships in Research),7057419,R24MD001786,[''],NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R24,2005,632530,0.06559525417545169

"Wounded Spirits, Ailing Hearts: PTSD and CVD in Indians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a unique psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction resulting from exposure to a stressful traumatic event(s). In the United States general population PTSD has a lifetime prevalence of 5 percent in men and 10 percent in women. PTSD is known to produce alternations in the central and autonomic nervous system and hormonal dysregulation. However, little is known about the long-term consequences of PTSD on the cardiovascular system. PTSD is a common disorder among reservation-dwelling American Indians (AIs) with a life-time prevalence of 12 percent in men and 23 percent in women. Similarly, cardiovascular disease (CVD), has emerged as a major health problem in AIs during the past decade. We propose to examine the relationship between PTSD and cardiac function in a population-based sample of AIs. The technical aims of this study involve: 1) the identification of AI men and women ages 18-52 who have a lifetime history of PTSD and are free from overt CVD; 2) the selection of an age-, sex-, and tribe-matched comparison group of AIs who have no history of PTSD and are free from known CVD; 3) a comprehensive lifestyle and clinical evaluation of the PTSD and non-PTSD groups to assess CVD risk factors such as smoking, exercise, obesity, blood pressure, concentrations of blood lipids, and inflammatory and thrombogenic factors; and 4) a set of non-invasive tests of subclinical CVD and other measures of CVD risk. These tests include positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging to examine coronary flow reserve, high-resolution ultrasound of the carotid arteries to measure carotid intima-media thickness, high-resolution ultrasound of the brachial artery to determine flow-mediated vasodilation, and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, to assess heart rate vadability (HRV). With these data, we will address our scientific aims, which are: 1) to determine whether individuals with PTSD, compared with those without PTSD, show greater evidence of subclinical CVD, including a lower coronary flow reserve, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and reduced forearm flow-mediated vasodilation; 2) to ascertain whether HRV is lower in individuals with PTSD compared to those without PTSD; and 3) to investigate the role of lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, exercise, obesity), cultural (e.g., acculturation, religiosity), and biological (e.g., blood pressure, blood lipid and glucose concentrations) mediators in the relationship of PTSD with coronary flow reserve and HRV. Since the emerging epidemic of CVD in AIs cannot be completely explained by changes in traditional risk factors, there is an urgent need to identify novel risk factors, like PTSD. Furthermore, the description of the influence of PTSD on the cardiovascular system could have immediate clinical and public health implications. Strategies for preventing PTSD, initiation of early treatment, and the identification of factors that mediate its potentially cardio-toxic effects could reduce morbidity and mortality from CVD.

"Autonomic function/insulin resistance/multiethnic popul    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Autonomic nervous system regulation of heartbeat variability is often disrupted among patients with diabetes.  Moreover, reduced heart rate variability has been associated with increased Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) mortality among diabetic and non-diabetic populations.  CVD mortality rates differ greatly among many ethnic groups.  In Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have been shown to have disproportionately higher CVD mortality than Asian and Caucasian groups.  Preliminary data from the Native Hawaiian Health Research Project suggest that conventional risk factors associated with Atherosclerosis may not fully account for ethnic disparities in heart disease and stroke mortality rates in Hawaii.  Insulin resistance has been associated with increased CVD incidence and mortality, and has also been associated with reduced heart rate variability.  The proposed study will investigate the relationship between insulin resistance and autonomic regulation of cardiac function in a multi-ethnic population.  The proposed research will also provide baseline data for future longitudinal studies that will investigate the extent to which these novel risk factors explain ethnic disparities in CVD mortality in Hawaii.  The findings of the proposed study may have important implications with regards to the treatment of insulin resistance as an independent CVD risk factor.      Specific Aims:  Collaborator component (Aim #1).  Establish a collaborative laboratory in Hawaii for the evaluation of autonomic function in a multiethnic population.  Principal Investigator component (Aim #2).  Investigate the relationship between insulin resistance, body-fat distribution, and autonomic function.  (Aim #3) Establish a cohort with baseline measures of autonomic function and insulin resistance that will serve as a study population for R01-supported longitudinal studies.  Hypotheses:  By fulfilling these specific aims, we propose to test the following specific research hypotheses:  (1.) Autonomic function will differ significantly by ethnicity, after adjustment for age, gender, body-mass index, and central obesity.  (2.) Insulin resistance is independently associated with autonomic function, after an adjustment for age, gender, body-mass index, and central obesity.  Secondary Questions:  Does insulin resistance and plasma glucose interact, in their effects on autonomic function?  What role do plasma lipids, blood pressure, diet, and physical activity have in explaining any observed ethnic disparities in autonomic function?

"Cardiovascular Disease Trends in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the recognition of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a leading cause of mortality, this country lacks a cohesive, informative surveillance system that can provide insights into national patterns of care, reveal national trends over time, and track short- and long-term patient outcomes for elderly Americans. Most national estimates of CVD and outcomes have been based on extrapolating rates from a very small number of community studies or clinical studies that are restricted in terms of size, demographics, or geography. In addition, outcome measures have most often been limited to recurrent disease or death, and typically consider short-term outcomes (rarely beyond 12 to 24 months). Related vascular events and nonvascular events are rarely considered. This has resulted in significant data gaps. Defining patterns and trends of CVD, and identifying differences and disparities among diverse groups in terms of age, race, gender, clinical history, as well as different geographic regions of the United States should be a top research priority. We have created a population-based national cohort that will begin to fill these gaps in knowledge. The Cardiovascular Disease Trends in the Elderly Study will span 12 years and include all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries discharged with CVD from 1991 through 2003. Accordingly, this study has the following specific aims: (1) Determine 12-year cardiovascular disease trends, especially by age, race, and gender subgroups, as well as region; (2) determine the short- and long-term outcomes for patients hospitalized with cardiovascular disease; and (3) determine the change in cost and outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries. This career development award will enable the candidate to build additional skills to link the complementary disciplines of clinical medicine, epidemiology, public health, biostatistics, and health economics to examine the burden of cardiovascular disease in the elderly. This unique perspective will provide valuable insights for policy makers and investigators in planning for the health care needs of patients with established cardiovascular disease.

"Morehouse-Emory Partnership to Reduce CV  Disparities The explosive epidemic of obesity that has occurred over the past decade has affected all segments of the population; but has had its most detrimental impact on high-risk ethnic populations. Despite the compelling evidence that obesity increases the risk of CVD mortality, the pathobiological pathways that mediate this increased risk remain to be further elucidated. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has recently been defined to capture the cluster of characteristics associated with obesity and high CVD risk. We are intrigued by the paradoxical observation that African-Americans (AA) have a lower prevalence of the MetS compared to whites despite a higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension. This observation suggests that current clinical criteria fail to identify obese AA at high risk for CVD. Further research in ethnic populations is necessary to guide more effective preventive interventions. It is postulated that ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD involve a complex interplay between behavioral, cultural, socio-economic and biological determinants. The theme of this Morehouse-Emory Partnership Program focuses on elucidating the etiologic basis of ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and discovering new intervention strategies to ameliorate CV health in all communities. The proposed Program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and develop effective therapeutic interventions by drawing upon the fields of physiology, biochemistry, vascular biology, psychology, public health, nursing and clinical medicine. In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's approach to elucidating ethnic disparities integrates the analysis of psycho-social parameters within the context of ethnic communities with the assessment of novel biomarkers and !assays of vascular function/structure that characterize differences in pathobiological pathways. This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between Emory University and the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM). In accordance with the RFA, the Program has at least four research-specific and two training-specific aims within Projects the subprojectsI and the shared resource Cores. Each project/core involves the synergy of a joint effort with investigators from both institutions. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Define the influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort. Aim 2: Define the effectiveness of a patient-centered lifestyle intervention to enhance the health of African-American patients with the metabolic syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices.

"The Emory-Morehouse Partnership to Reduce CV Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Over the past decade, there has been an explosive increase in obesity among all age groups within the US population.  This epidemic is particularly problematic among African-Americans in the Southeast. Although genetic factors play a contributory role, it is postulated that ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) is related to a dynamic interplay between biological factors and the behavioral response to the unique environmental context within ethnic communities. Obesity is often associated with perturbations in the metabolic and physiologic milieu.  A cluster of obesity-related abnormalities has been defined as the ""Metabolic Syndrome"".  The CVD complications of obesity appears to be related to the capacity for adipose tissue itself to generate ""adipokines"" that   directly predispose to insulin-resistance, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and vascular disease. The proposed program will use state-of-the-art approaches to define potential ethnic differences in the profile of metabolic, physiologic and biochemical features associated with obesity as well as the salutary responses to lifestyle modification.  The proposed program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize potential ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD by drawing upon the fields of psychology, physiology, biochemistry, nursing and clinical medicine.  In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's research plan ranges from:  epidemiology studies within the ethnic communities, to patient-centered clinical trial interventions within ethnic community practices, tothe analysis of novel biomarkers of human pathobiology.  This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between the Morehouse School of Medicine and Emory University.  This partnership shares a joint commitment to address the striking ethnic disparities in the high-risk CVD population that we serve.  The specific aims are:  Aim 1:  Define the relative influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort.  Aim 2:  Define the effectiveness of patient-targeted behavioral interventions to enhance the health of African-American patients with the   Metabolic Syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices.  Aim 3:  To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans.

"The HHER Lifestyle Program for CVD Risk Reduction    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for women in the United States, claiming more lives each year than all cancers combined. CVD and coronary heart disease (CHD) morbidity and mortality rates are significantly higher in African American (AA) women than in white women. Health care sites are excellent settings in which to counsel individuals regarding CVD risk reduction. Few studies to date, however, have tested the effectiveness of health care-based interventions with AA women or financially disadvantaged populations. The overall goal of this study, the Heart Healthy and Ethnically Relevant (HHER) Lifestyle Program, is to advance our understanding of how to effectively promote CVD risk reduction in health care settings among financially disadvantaged AA women ages 35 years and older. The proposed randomized clinical trial builds on recently completed formative and feasibility studies conducted by the investigators.

"STRESS REDUCTION AND CVD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN BLACKS-II DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans. Substantial evidence indicates that high levels of psychosocial and socioenvironmental stress contribute to the excessive morbidity and mortality in this population. In earlier controlled trials with African Americans and other populations at high risk for CVD, the current collaborative team demonstrated that a selected stress reduction approach, the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program, was associated with significant reductions in CVD risk factors and surrogate markers for clinical CVD. These include clinically significant decreases in hypertension, myocardial ischemia and carotid atherosclerosis, as well as improvements in psychosocial stress and quality of life. In the previous NHLBI-sponsored clinical trial, 201 African American men and women with documented coronary heart disease (mean age 59 years) were randomized to either stress reduction with the TM program or a health education control. The results showed 50 percent lower risk of combined mortality and CVD morbidity in the stress reduction group compared to control (RR = .50, p <.05) after a median three year follow-up period. Preliminary analysis, in preparation for the proposed study, suggests lower risk of ""hard"" events alone--mortality, MI and stroke (RR= .42; p = .15).  The proposed study will conduct long-term follow-up of intervention and testing of the previous trial of 201 African American participants for an additional five funded years. This study will definitively evaluate long-term effects of behavioral stress reduction compared to control on ""hard"" CVD endpoints and sustainability of disease-free survival on combined ""hard"" and ""soft"" CVD endpoints (all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, coronary revascularizations, and hospitalizations for heart failure and ischemic heart disease, non-MI). Secondary outcomes will include traditional CVD risk factors (BP, lipids, diet, exercise, weight), psychosocial risk factors (depression, hostility, anger), quality of life, medication use, compliance, and cost effectiveness. To our knowledge, this is the only randomized controlled trial of behavioral stress reduction for the secondary prevention of CVD in African American men and women. The results of this unique long-term study will contribute critical new knowledge for the elimination of racial and ethnic diparities in health.

"MENTORED PATIENT-ORIENTED RESEARCH CAREER DEVELOPMENT AWARD DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Hispanics are the largest ethnic minority group in the country and MA constitute almost 80% of Hispanics in California.  MA have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and a higher risk for diabetic nephropathy (DN).  Paradoxically, data including our own suggest that CVD burden may be lower in MA than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW).  We seek to define the CVD burden (coronary artery calcification, CAC) and its determinants in a high-risk sub-group of non-dialyzed diabetics with DN (125 MA, 125 NHW), in order to test three hypotheses:  1) Among individuals with DN, the CAC scores in MA are lower and progress more slowly, than among NHW; 2) The socioeconomic status (SES) of MA individuals with DN is significantly lower than of NHW; and 3) Among individuals with DN, MA have a lower all-cause and CVD mortality.  Ten routinely measured, two additional CVD risk factors (homocysteine, leptin) and three SES variables, pre-specified for primary analyses, will be ascertained at baseline, 12 and 24 months.  CAC will be ascertained by electron beam computerized tomography at baseline and 24 months.  The relationship of CVD risk factors and SES variables that vary by ethnicity will be tested for their contribution to ethnic differences in CAC.  The entire cohort will be followed from enrollment till the end of the grant period to ascertain ethnic differences in all-cause and CVD mortality; a high event rate in this population provides power to test the hypotheses thus proposed.  A rigorous plan for complete follow-up is proposed.  Thus, this study will define for the first time the comparative atherosclerotic burden in MA and NHW with DN and the potential role of several CVD risk factors.  It will test the novel hypothesis that despite medical and SES factors that might increase the risk for CVD mortality in MA, the opposite may be true.  Identifying health-care disparities will permit us to design targeted interventions to improve the health of ethnic minorities.  Recognition of factors associated with the lower CVD risk among MA or the higher risk among NHW may help develop therapies that may potentially reduce the CVD burden among patients with DN.

"Heart Failure Disparities in Native Hawaiians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem leading to considerable cardiovascular morbidity &  mortality.  The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.  Partners of the HFD Program include:  MedStar Research Institute, Oahu-based Community Health Centers (CHCs) & the Hawaii EXPORT Center, an NIH-funded initiative addressing diabetes-associated disparities in NH/PP.  The HFD Program will achieve the following research & educational aims:  1) Determine the reliability & validity of echocardiograms performed by community-based health workers compared to a professionally trained sonographer as the ""gold standard"".  2) Determine if a culturally competent educational program for heart failure reduces HF hospitalizations & mortality compared to usual care.  3) Characterize ethnic differences in the heart failure syndrome in hospitalized NHs & PPs compared to Caucasians.  4) Construct HF pedigrees using probands identified at the QEC for a future HF linkage study in NHs & PPs.  5) Educate community-based health workers to perform echocardiography scans for the detection of HF in a high risk population of NHs & PPs.  6) Train new investigators to conduct  research focused on CVD disparities in general, and heart failure in particular.  By achieving these aims, the HFD Program will improve access to HF care at CHCs that serve NHs & PPs, fill a gap in knowledge of CVD disparities in NHs & PPs and provide a foundation for future studies on genetic determinants of HF.

"Poverty, Stress and Cardiovascular Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older women of low socioeconomic status (SES) have higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than older women of high SES. This difference, a source of disparity in mortality and disability, is not explained by traditional CVD risk factors. Despite recent policy emphasis on health disparities, the Contributing biological mechanisms are largely unspecified. Differential stress experience between SES groups could affect CVD disparities. Allostatic load is a single parameter that represents the sum of multiple body system indicators and is theorized to be a cumulative measure of stress-related biological risk. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that allostatic load is a mediator between SES and incident CVD in a population of older women. The study will use data from the Women's Health and Aging Study 2, a 10 year longitudinal study of 436 women aged 70-79 years old at baseline. The socioeconomic diversity of the subjects and the range of biological data provided are ideal to test the candidate's hypotheses. Employing the theory of allostatic load in a sample of older women of a wide SES range may provide important insight into mechanisms contributing to the significant problem of health disparities in CVD.

"Reducing CVD risk/health disparities--active living    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and diabetes are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, yet we are ineffective in preventing these costly and debilitating chronic conditions. Although programs and strategies to improve behavioral screening and counseling are needed, health care interventions alone are inadequate for preventing CVD and other chronic diseases. Consistent with social ecological models, which point to the importance of multi-level influences on health, research on the impact of the built environment on CVD risk behaviors offers a compelling case for building ""active living"" into neighborhoods as an effective community-based CVD prevention strategy. The Stapleton development is the largest urban renewal project currently ongoing in the United States. Located on the vacated Stapleton Airport grounds in Denver, Stapleton's redevelopment began in 2001 by Forest City Enterprises, the developer hired to lead this multi-decade effort. Its 4,700 acres (of which more than one third is dedicated to green space) are designed as mixed-use neighborhoods to enhance active living with pocket parks, walking and bicycle trails and wide sidewalks and its community recreation facilities. Currently Stapleton has almost 1,500 families, and in 10 years will be home to over 30,000 residents. Importantly, its close proximity to adjacent neighborhoods that are racially and ethnically diverse and socio-economically disadvantaged, offers access to active living amenities to residents who previously experienced over 40 years of airport noise, traffic and pollution. This development of a new urban enclave with an established built environment is an unusual circumstance that presents exceptional opportunities for learning about community development and its impact on health and health disparities both in the new community and in the established communities surrounding it. Our proposed project fits with recent recommendations to increase knowledge of the impacts of population-based approaches for preventing cardiovascular disease. We will use community- and culturally-relevant data collection methods to understand how to increase use of Stapleton's active living environment to improve levels of physical activity and cardiovascular risk by residents of Stapleton and the diverse communities adjacent to it. An important resource for this research will be a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process that involves diverse residents of Stapleton and surrounding neighborhoods (hereinafter called the Greater Stapleton Community) in addressing these complex issues. Although Stapleton included community input early in its planning process, this project's establishment of a formalized CBPR process creates a more community-wide approach for building a diverse and ""permeable"" active living community.

"Autonomic function/insulin resistance/multiethnic popul    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Autonomic nervous system regulation of heartbeat variability is often disrupted among patients with diabetes.  Moreover, reduced heart rate variability has been associated with increased Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) mortality among diabetic and non-diabetic populations.  CVD mortality rates differ greatly among many ethnic groups.  In Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have been shown to have disproportionately higher CVD mortality than Asian and Caucasian groups.  Preliminary data from the Native Hawaiian Health Research Project suggest that conventional risk factors associated with Atherosclerosis may not fully account for ethnic disparities in heart disease and stroke mortality rates in Hawaii.  Insulin resistance has been associated with increased CVD incidence and mortality, and has also been associated with reduced heart rate variability.  The proposed study will investigate the relationship between insulin resistance and autonomic regulation of cardiac function in a multi-ethnic population.  The proposed research will also provide baseline data for future longitudinal studies that will investigate the extent to which these novel risk factors explain ethnic disparities in CVD mortality in Hawaii.  The findings of the proposed study may have important implications with regards to the treatment of insulin resistance as an independent CVD risk factor.      Specific Aims:  Collaborator component (Aim #1).  Establish a collaborative laboratory in Hawaii for the evaluation of autonomic function in a multiethnic population.  Principal Investigator component (Aim #2).  Investigate the relationship between insulin resistance, body-fat distribution, and autonomic function.  (Aim #3) Establish a cohort with baseline measures of autonomic function and insulin resistance that will serve as a study population for R01-supported longitudinal studies.  Hypotheses:  By fulfilling these specific aims, we propose to test the following specific research hypotheses:  (1.) Autonomic function will differ significantly by ethnicity, after adjustment for age, gender, body-mass index, and central obesity.  (2.) Insulin resistance is independently associated with autonomic function, after an adjustment for age, gender, body-mass index, and central obesity.  Secondary Questions:  Does insulin resistance and plasma glucose interact, in their effects on autonomic function?

"Morehouse-Emory Partnership to Reduce CV  Disparities The explosive epidemic of obesity that has occurred over the past decade has affected all segments of the population; but has had its most detrimental impact on high-risk ethnic populations. Despite the compelling evidence that obesity increases the risk of CVD mortality, the pathobiological pathways that mediate this increased risk remain to be further elucidated. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has recently been defined to capture the cluster of characteristics associated with obesity and high CVD risk. We are intrigued by the paradoxical observation that African-Americans (AA) have a lower prevalence of the MetS compared to whites despite a higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension. This observation suggests that current clinical criteria fail to identify obese AA at high risk for CVD. Further research in ethnic populations is necessary to guide more effective preventive interventions. It is postulated that ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD involve a complex interplay between behavioral, cultural, socio-economic and biological determinants. The theme of this Morehouse-Emory Partnership Program focuses on elucidating the etiologic basis of ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and discovering new intervention strategies to ameliorate CV health in all communities. The proposed Program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and develop effective therapeutic interventions by drawing upon the fields of physiology, biochemistry, vascular biology, psychology, public health, nursing and clinical medicine. In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's approach to elucidating ethnic disparities integrates the analysis of psycho-social parameters within the context of ethnic communities with the assessment of novel biomarkers and !assays of vascular function/structure that characterize differences in pathobiological pathways.

Aim 3: To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans. Aim 4: To enhance the education/training of fellows/practitioners engaged in CVD disparities research/practice and promote partnerships that enhance cardiovascular health within ethnic communities.

"Stanford MKITS Science Program: CVD and Public Health DESCRIPTION  (provided by applicant): Background:  Only 0.5% of Native American, 16% of Latino, and 21% of African American high school graduates earn a college degree compared with 37% of White students, resulting in a critical shortage of underrepresented ethnic minorities in scientific and health careers.  Partners:  A partnership has been formed between an internationally renowned research program in cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemiology at Stanford and science teachers from four California high schools.  Each school population is either predominantly rural Native American, rural Latino, urban Latino, or urban African American.  Curriculum:  We will develop and evaluate a curriculum focused on CVD, the scientific process, health disparities, health careers, and the college admissions process.  The major components of our program are school-based:  1) an academic-year science program for all interested juniors (10-25 students from each school for a total of 80 per year); and Stanford-based:  2) a one-day CVD and college guidance workshop each year for all science program students and their guidance counselors and parents; 3) a five-week CVD Summer Institute for selected science program students (about 5 students from each school for a total of 20 per year who will return to their schools as seniors to be teaching assistants); and 4) a one-week CVD Summer Institute for science teachers (1-3 teachers from each school for about 8 per year).  During the program, we will train 320 students overall and 100 students   intensively.  Focus:  The curriculum for both students and teachers will have a broad focus on CVD and public health.  It will be distinguished by:  hands-on CVD science demonstrations; community-based, culturally-relevant group research projects; interactions with biomedical research scientists; hospital and clinical field placements in the community and at Stanford; strong mentoring from Stanford faculty and students; individualized college and career guidance; technology training; and long-term student and institutional support.  Evaluation:  We will use process and outcome evaluation to assess teacher training, the curriculum implementation, student engagement in and knowledge about the scientific process, number of students entering college and scientific professions, and dissemination and sustainability of the program.  We will follow all students annually through college graduation and beyond using a telephone survey to provide long-term support and evaluate the numbers pursuing science majors in college and entering scientific and health careers.  Our new program will build on our highly successful 15-year-old summer academic enrichment program that has reached 333 low-income high school students.

"GENE/DIET EFFECTS ON PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the US and their risks are determined by non-modifiable (i.e., genetic) and modifiable factors (i.e., plasma lipid levels). It is well established that low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased CVD risk. A key determinant of HDL metabolism is hepatic lipase (HL), an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in lipoproteins. Within the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene at position -514 exists a common C/T polymorphism. The -514TT genotype is associated with an approximate 40% decrease in HL activity and increased HDL-C levels. However, this effect is variable among populations, suggesting gene- environment interactions. One of this grant's earlier key findings is that the -514 polymorphism shows a statistically significant interaction between HDL-C levels and dietary fat intake in Whites. Moreover, we replicated the findings in an Asian population. What remains to be demonstrated is whether these interactions occur when subjects modify their dietary fat intake and if so, what mechanisms are involved. Thus, the primary goal of this proposal is to use an interventional setting to thoroughly evaluate interactions between LIPC gene variants, changes in dietary fat intake and plasma lipid levels, inflammation markers and endothelial function. Moreover, we hypothesize that minorities, such as Hispanics, due to the enrichment of the -514 T allele (approximately 0.36) are more susceptible to the effects of these gene-diet interactions. Hence, we propose a randomized, cross over, two-phase diet intervention aimed at assessing the impact of consuming different levels of dietary fat (15% and 37%, respectively, 6 weeks each) on plasma HDL related measures in Caribbean Hispanic subjects (n=80; 40 CC and 40 TT). Our main hypothesis is that CC subjects respond to increases in the % of energy consumed as fat with increases in HDL-C levels. Conversely, in TT subjects, such dietary change results in decreases in HDL-C levels and worsening of endothelial function. Therefore, T subjects will have an elevated CVD risk when consuming high fat diets. Moreover, given the high frequency of the T allele in Hispanics, this interaction could account for some of the increase in CVD risk seen after acculturation. This evidence-based knowledge will contribute to a rational approach toward more effective dietary recommendations aimed to decrease health disparities and to a better CVD prevention.           ",GENE/DIET EFFECTS ON PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS,7144389,R01HL054776,"['biomarker ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' clinical trial ', ' inflammation ', ' genetic polymorphism ', ' human subject ', ' high density lipoprotein ', ' diet therapy ', ' dietary lipid ', ' nutrition related tag ', ' Hispanic American ', ' Caribbean ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' human therapy evaluation ', ' human genetic material tag ', ' family genetics ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' hepatic lipase ', ' clinical research ', ' genetic susceptibility ', ' genetic screening ', ' patient oriented research ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' scavenger receptor ', ' ']",NHLBI,TUFTS UNIVERSITY BOSTON,R01,2006,369900,0.1115214547780802
"Wounded Spirits, Ailing Hearts: PTSD and CVD in Indians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a unique psychiatric condition characterized by a persistent maladaptive reaction resulting from exposure to a stressful traumatic event(s). In the United States general population PTSD has a lifetime prevalence of 5 percent in men and 10 percent in women. PTSD is known to produce alternations in the central and autonomic nervous system and hormonal dysregulation. However, little is known about the long-term consequences of PTSD on the cardiovascular system. PTSD is a common disorder among reservation-dwelling American Indians (AIs) with a life-time prevalence of 12 percent in men and 23 percent in women. Similarly, cardiovascular disease (CVD), has emerged as a major health problem in AIs during the past decade. We propose to examine the relationship between PTSD and cardiac function in a population-based sample of AIs. The technical aims of this study involve: 1) the identification of AI men and women ages 18-52 who have a lifetime history of PTSD and are free from overt CVD; 2) the selection of an age-, sex-, and tribe-matched comparison group of AIs who have no history of PTSD and are free from known CVD; 3) a comprehensive lifestyle and clinical evaluation of the PTSD and non-PTSD groups to assess CVD risk factors such as smoking, exercise, obesity, blood pressure, concentrations of blood lipids, and inflammatory and thrombogenic factors; and 4) a set of non-invasive tests of subclinical CVD and other measures of CVD risk. These tests include positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging to examine coronary flow reserve, high-resolution ultrasound of the carotid arteries to measure carotid intima-media thickness, high-resolution ultrasound of the brachial artery to determine flow-mediated vasodilation, and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, to assess heart rate vadability (HRV). With these data, we will address our scientific aims, which are: 1) to determine whether individuals with PTSD, compared with those without PTSD, show greater evidence of subclinical CVD, including a lower coronary flow reserve, increased carotid intima-media thickness, and reduced forearm flow-mediated vasodilation; 2) to ascertain whether HRV is lower in individuals with PTSD compared to those without PTSD; and 3) to investigate the role of lifestyle (e.g., smoking, alcohol use, exercise, obesity), cultural (e.g., acculturation, religiosity), and biological (e.g., blood pressure, blood lipid and glucose concentrations) mediators in the relationship of PTSD with coronary flow reserve and HRV. Since the emerging epidemic of CVD in AIs cannot be completely explained by changes in traditional risk factors, there is an urgent need to identify novel risk factors, like PTSD. Furthermore, the description of the influence of PTSD on the cardiovascular system could have immediate clinical and public health implications. Strategies for preventing PTSD, initiation of early treatment, and the identification of factors that mediate its potentially cardio-toxic effects could reduce morbidity and mortality from CVD.

"Reducing Total Cardiovascular Risk in an Urban Community The proposed study is based on the premise that a community based participatory research partnership model using a team of an advanced practice nurse case manager, community health worker (CHW), and physician can be translated into urban community clinics and improve the quality of care and reduce disparities in cardiovascular health in minority and other underserved populations. Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of CVD risk-reducing practices remains poor. In spite of the known benefit of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dl in persons with existing heart disease, as many as 50-70% of eligible CVD patients are not placed on lipid-lowering therapy by their providers and from 20-80% of patients do not achieve the goals of therapy. The benefits of controlling high blood pressure (HBP) are well established yet national rates of HBP control remain at only 3 1% despite decades of provider and patient education. In addition, it is well established that control of glycemia, hyperlipidemia, and blood pressure reduce the risk of vascular complications in people with diabetes, 75% of whom die from some form of heart or blood vessel disease. This randomized trial will compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive intensive intervention (Cl) with a less intensive intervention (LI) in African American (AA), and White low income patients with known excessive CVD risk. A total of 500 eligible patients with CVD or type 2 diabetes (250 AA and 250 White) will be randomly selected from two urban federally-funded community clinics and randomly assigned to receive either 1) a Cl delivered by a nurse practitioner, a CHW, and the patient's physician, focusing on behavioral interventions to affect therapeutic lifestyle changes and medication adherence as well as the prescription and titration of medications or 2) a LI intervention providing feedback on CVD risk factors and guidelines to patients and their physicians. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, one and two years. It is hypothesized that a higher proportion of patients in the Cl group will achieve the treatment goals for lipid, blood pressure, and diabetes management, lifestyle behaviors and utilization of antiplatelet agent, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor therapies and that the Cl intervention wilj be cost-effective. Secondary outcomes include assessment of the impact of the Cl model on patients' satisfaction with care and health care utilization. The proposed increase in the percentage of high-risk women and men who receive recommended secondary prevention therapies and achieve goal levels could potentially result in a marked decrement in annual CVD mortality and health disparities if applied within primary care settings to populations with the characteristics of the target groups for this study.

"Childhood Exposures and Adulthood Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing body of evidence shows that conditions in early life are associated with future risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). To increase understanding of why disparities in the social distribution of CVD arise, the proposed research aims to (1) use multiple indicators of early life exposures to test which characteristics of infant and childhood conditions are most strongly associated with adult CVD risk; 2) test five potential mechanisms linking early environments to CVD risk in adulthood: material well-being, social support, health behaviors, exposure to stressors, and coping skills; and 3) examine gender differences in the relationship between and pathways linking early environments to CVD risk.

"Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) populations show disproportionate rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, and eliminating these disparities is a priority objective of Healthy People 2010. Previous research suggests that in addition to many other variables, psychosocial factors may contribute to CVD disparities. The proposed research will use the Reserve Capacity Model (Gallo and Matthews, 2003) as a conceptual framework through which to examine the roles of stress, psychosocial resources, and emotional factors in SES and ethnic CVD disparities, in a community-based random sample of middle-aged, Mexican-American and non-Latino White women with relatively low and high SES (N=300). The Reserve Capacity Model posits that individuals with lower social status (low SES, minority ethnicity) may suffer negative emotional and physical health consequences due to stress experienced across multiple domains. Stress may exert direct effects on behavioral and physiological risk processes, or it may influence emotional variables which are themselves putative CVD risk factors. In addition, persons with low social status may maintain a smaller bank of resilient psychosocial resources with which to manage stress, making them especially vulnerable to concomitant physical and emotional wear and tear. The effects of low SES may be amplified in Latino women (i.e., synergistic effects). However, Mexican-American women could also benefit from resilient, socio-cultural resources that protect them, to some extent, from stress. In the current study, women will undergo a comprehensive assessment of SES, psychosocial factors, physiological and behavioral risk factors, and CVD biomarkers, and will participate in a two-day evaluation of ambulatory blood pressure and psychosocial experiences assessed via ecological momentary assessment. By examining potentially modifiable psychosocial variables as a pathway underlying CVD disparities, this study seeks to inform efforts to understand and eliminate health disparities.           ",Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways,7096250,R01HL081604,"['human middle age (35-64) ', ' biomarker ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' blood pressure ', ' inflammation ', ' heart rate ', ' human subject ', ' questionnaire ', ' psychological model ', ' social psychology ', ' female ', ' Mexican American ', ' caucasian American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' socioeconomics ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' stress ', ' psychological stressor ', ' clinical research ', ' behavioral /social science research tag ', ' health services research tag ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2006,622024,0.08544414547675676
"Disparities in CHD in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This K01 award will allow the candidate, Dr. Mario Sims, to gain the skills, knowledge and experience required to become an independent investigator in health disparities research. Using data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Dr. Sims will examine the extent to which neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and key psychosocial factors (discrimination, stress, and social support) impact coronary heart disease (CHD) in African Americans in Mississippi. The JHS is the largest epidemiologic, population-based study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among African Americans, and one of its primary aims - to develop young talented minority investigators in the field of CVD research - will be accomplished through this KO1 award. CHD is the leading cause of CVD mortality in America, and Mississippi has the highest overall CVD mortality rate in the nation. Moreover, the cardiovascular health disparity between African Americans and whites is widening. Mississippi's CHD mortality rate is higher than the U.S. rate. African Americans have higher CHD prevalence and mortality rates than whites, and they also have a higher prevalence of risk factors associated with CHD such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity which clearly might influence the higher prevalence of CHD mortality. To achieve his research and career development goals, Dr. Sims will follow a career development plan at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, designed to provide knowledge, skills, and experience in 6 core competencies required to be a successful independent investigator in health disparities research: 1) research excellence in the area of CHD disparities, 2) advanced statistics and study design, 3) research ethics, 4) leadership and management, 5) presentation and teaching, and 6) scientific writing. This will be accomplished through implementation of an individualized learning plan that includes: 1) academic coursework to develop cardiovascular disease disparity research skills; 2) mentorship and consultation with nationally and internationally recognized experts in cardiovascular disease epidemiology and health disparities research; 3) mentorship by faculty sensitive to the unique needs and issues facing minority academic faculty; and 4) innovative research using a multi-dimensional framework for examining how CHD prevalence among African Americans is influence by neighborhood environments, perceived discrimination, stress, and social support. The proposed mentored research has three specific aims: 1) to examine the extent to which neighborhood SES is associated with CHD among African Americans; 2) to determine the degree to which perceived racial discrimination, stress and social support are associated with CHD among African Americans; and 3) to analyze the extent to which the association of neighborhood SES and CHD is mediated by psychosocial factors among African Americans. This is the first study of its kind to examine multiple pathways by which neighborhood SES and key psychosocial factors impact CHD risk in African Americans in Mississippi, a state with the highest CHD rate in the nation. This research will enable health-care providers to adequately serve their patients with CHD knowing that where they live and their exposure to discrimination, stress, and a lack of social support are sequelae to CHD. This research will also show which factors health policy makers need to focus on in order to address and eliminate CHD disparities.

"Heart Failure Disparities in Native Hawaiians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem leading to considerable cardiovascular morbidity &  mortality.  The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.  Partners of the HFD Program include:  MedStar Research Institute, Oahu-based Community Health Centers (CHCs) & the Hawaii EXPORT Center, an NIH-funded initiative addressing diabetes-associated disparities in NH/PP.  The HFD Program will achieve the following research & educational aims:  1) Determine the reliability & validity of echocardiograms performed by community-based health workers compared to a professionally trained sonographer as the ""gold standard"".  2) Determine if a culturally competent educational program for heart failure reduces HF hospitalizations & mortality compared to usual care.  3) Characterize ethnic differences in the heart failure syndrome in hospitalized NHs & PPs compared to Caucasians.  4) Construct HF pedigrees using probands identified at the QEC for a future HF linkage study in NHs & PPs.  5) Educate community-based health workers to perform echocardiography scans for the detection of HF in a high risk population of NHs & PPs.  6) Train new investigators to conduct research focused on CVD disparities in general, and heart failure in particular.  By achieving these aims, the HFD Program will improve access to HF care at CHCs that serve NHs & PPs, fill a gap in knowledge of CVD disparities in NHs & PPs and provide a foundation for future studies on genetic determinants of HF.

"STRESS REDUCTION AND CVD MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY IN BLACKS-II DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality compared to white Americans. Substantial evidence indicates that high levels of psychosocial and socioenvironmental stress contribute to the excessive morbidity and mortality in this population. In earlier controlled trials with African Americans and other populations at high risk for CVD, the current collaborative team demonstrated that a selected stress reduction approach, the Transcendental Meditation (TM) program, was associated with significant reductions in CVD risk factors and surrogate markers for clinical CVD. These include clinically significant decreases in hypertension, myocardial ischemia and carotid atherosclerosis, as well as improvements in psychosocial stress and quality of life. In the previous NHLBI-sponsored clinical trial, 201 African American men and women with documented coronary heart disease (mean age 59 years) were randomized to either stress reduction with the TM program or a health education control. The results showed 50 percent lower risk of combined mortality and CVD morbidity in the stress reduction group compared to control (RR = .50, p <.05) after a median three year follow-up period. Preliminary analysis, in preparation for the proposed study, suggests lower risk of ""hard"" events alone--mortality, MI and stroke (RR= .42; p = .15).  The proposed study will conduct long-term follow-up of intervention and testing of the previous trial of 201 African American participants for an additional five funded years. This study will definitively evaluate long-term effects of behavioral stress reduction compared to control on ""hard"" CVD endpoints and sustainability of disease-free survival on combined ""hard"" and ""soft"" CVD endpoints (all-cause mortality, MI, stroke, coronary revascularizations, and hospitalizations for heart failure and ischemic heart disease, non-MI). Secondary outcomes will include traditional CVD risk factors (BP, lipids, diet, exercise, weight), psychosocial risk factors (depression, hostility, anger), quality of life, medication use, compliance, and cost effectiveness. To our knowledge, this is the only randomized controlled trial of behavioral stress reduction for the secondary prevention of CVD in African American men and women. The results of this unique long-term study will contribute critical new knowledge for the elimination of racial and ethnic diparities in health.

"Relationship of Blood Esterases, Pesticide Exposure and Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for an R21 grant is designed to solidify an interdisciplinary team of basic and clinical researchers in the Center for Environmental Health Sciences at Mississippi State University for research into the environmental factors contributing to the higher mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Deep South and among African Americans, and to position this team for participation in larger-scale on- going multi-institutional epidemiological studies. This health disparity in CVD is logically related to risk factors more prevalent in the South (which has a higher proportion of African Americans than other regions in the country.) The South is rural and highly agricultural, so the Southern populations would be expected to be routinely exposed to higher levels of pesticides than populations in many other regions. We hypothesize the following: The effects of pesticide exposure contribute to the development of CVD and are more pronounced in the African American population. Two enzymes that we have studied for many years because of their involvement in the detoxication of many pesticides are paraoxonase (PON1) and carboxylesterase (CaE). The former is known to be associated with HDL particles and the latter has recently been identified as a cholesteryl ester hydrolase that is involved in reverse cholesterol transport; therefore, both of these enzymes are involved in vascular health, and are potential biomarkers of susceptibility to CVD. We have experience biomonitoring urinary pesticide metabolites as an index of current pesticide exposure. We have developed a novel geospatial analysis of pesticide harvested crop records that predicts pesticide exposure to individuals for the previous 35 years of their lives. We have experience in cardiology and access to patients in a cardiology practice. We propose a pilot study to investigate the above listed parameters (i.e., PON1 and CaE in the blood and pesticide metabolites in the urine) of subjects recruited from the cardiology practice, and to calculate strength of associations among these factors, the degree of cardiovascular disease and the pesticide exposure estimated in the geospatial analysis model. This pilot study will be conducted following a year of planning, solidifying the interdisciplinary team, optimizing assays, and developing interactions with the project's consultants. The pilot study will position us to participate in a far more extensive study through interactions with our consultants at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In addition, we anticipate that we will develop more simplified assay methods for PON1 and CaE that will be more amenable for use as a clinical biomarker.              ","Relationship of Blood Esterases, Pesticide Exposure and Cardiovascular Disease",7169272,R21ES015107,"['biomarker ', ' carboxylic ester hydrolase ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' blood chemistry ', ' urinalysis ', ' esterase ', ' genetic polymorphism ', ' human subject ', ' statistics /biometry ', ' pesticide ', ' pesticide biological effect ', ' African American ', ' racial /ethnic difference ', ' rural area ', ' clinical research ', ' genetic susceptibility ', ' environmental exposure ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NIEHS,MISSISSIPPI STATE UNIVERSITY,R21,2006,143000,0.13332546259898354
"The Emory-Morehouse Partnership to Reduce CV Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Over the past decade, there has been an explosive increase in obesity among all age groups within the US population.  This epidemic is particularly problematic among African-Americans in the Southeast. Although genetic factors play a contributory role, it is postulated that ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) is related to a dynamic interplay between biological factors and the behavioral response to the unique environmental context within ethnic communities. Obesity is often associated with perturbations in the metabolic and physiologic milieu.  A cluster of obesity-related abnormalities has been defined as the ""Metabolic Syndrome"".  The CVD complications of obesity appears to be related to the capacity for adipose tissue itself to generate ""adipokines"" that   directly predispose to insulin-resistance, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and vascular disease. The proposed program will use state-of-the-art approaches to define potential ethnic differences in the profile of metabolic, physiologic and biochemical features associated with obesity as well as the salutary responses to lifestyle modification.  The proposed program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize potential ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD by drawing upon the fields of psychology, physiology, biochemistry, nursing and clinical medicine.  In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's research plan ranges from:  epidemiology studies within the ethnic communities, to patient-centered clinical trial interventions within ethnic community practices, tothe analysis of novel biomarkers of human pathobiology.  This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between the Morehouse School of Medicine and Emory University.  This partnership shares a joint commitment to address the striking ethnic disparities in the high-risk CVD population that we serve.  The specific aims are:  Aim 1:  Define the relative influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort.  Aim 2:  Define the effectiveness of patient-targeted behavioral interventions to enhance the health of African-American patients with the   Metabolic Syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices.  Aim 3:  To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans.

"Health Disparities and CVD: Admixture Mapping in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic risk for complex processes like CVD appears to involve interactions among multiple genes of small effect. Association mapping is much more powerful than linkage mapping in identifying such genes, but requires 200-500 times as many markers to scan the genome. Admixture mapping can extract much of the power of association studies but requires genotyping only a few thousand markers genome-wide. This application partners Jackson Heart Study (JHS) investigators with two leaders in the field of admixture mapping, Drs. David Reich and Nick Patterson. The studies proposed will exploit the genotyping and analytic power of the Broad Institute to perform admixture mapping in the largest cohort ever assembled to study CVD in African Americans. Several factors contribute to the timeliness of this study and show the strength of the proposed research team: (a) Our group has published the first practical genetic resource for admixture mapping: 2,154 markers with large frequency differences between Africans and Europeans, and methods to analyze the data. (b) We have assembled a unique cohort for the largest-ever genome-wide admixture scan for CVD risk genes: 3,796 unrelated African Americans rigorously characterized for a large number of CVD phenotypes, including HTN, coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. (c) Admixture mapping has had its first empiric successes, localizing genes for hypertension and multiple sclerosis. Admixture mapping works in practice, making it critically important to apply it to seek CVD genes in the JHS cohort. We propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Whole-genome admixture scanning for CVD related genes. We will type 3,072 admixture mapping markers in DMA of 3,796 unrelated African American participants from the JHS cohort. We will concentrate our analyses on phenotypes with known differences in prevalence between African Americans and Europeans: hypertension, serum lipid levels, left ventricular hypertrophy, and low birth weight. Specific Aim 2: Follow-up and fine-mapping of the two strongest peaks of association. We will genotype 2,535 additional SNPs/peak in 940 participants (470 at each extreme for the selected phenotype). Specific Aim 3: Acquire all recorded birth weights for JHS participants. Birth weight will be analyzed both as a covariate for CVD phenotypes and as an independent phenotype, by admixture mapping. Lav language description: Finding genes that affect the risk of disease can identify new targets for drug treatment and lead to the development of important medical tests. These studies will seek genes of African and European origin that cause heart and blood vessel diseases in African Americans.           ",Health Disparities and CVD: Admixture Mapping in the Jackson Heart Study,7077078,R01HL084107,"['hypertension ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' human birth weight ', ' genetic marker ', ' linkage mapping ', ' gene expression ', ' ventricular hypertrophy ', ' human subject ', ' lipid metabolism ', ' African American ', ' European ', ' human genetic material tag ', ' clinical research ', ' health services research tag ', ' genetic susceptibility ', ' health disparity ', ' single nucleotide polymorphism ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,R01,2006,748233,0.1264452191588908

"Project AsPIRE (Asian American Partnerships in Research)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this three-year planning grant is to improve health access and status for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Filipino Americans living in the New York City metropolitan area through the use of patient navigators. This application has four specific aims: (1) to create an infrastructure that facilitates the conduct of community-based participatory research (CBPR), (2) to conduct a descriptive study that examines the Filipino American community's knowledge, health practices, health access, and risk factors for CVD, (3) to conduct an experimental study to assess the efficacy of an intensive patient navigator intervention in improving health access and status for CVD among Filipino Americans, and (4) to evaluate CBPR as an approach for addressing and eliminating health disparities. Year 1 focuses on partnership development and creation, with community participation, of a patient navigator intervention to improve hypertension control in Filipino Americans.  The Kalusugan (i.e., ""health"" in Pilipino) Coalition-comprised of academic and community partners serving the Filipino American community-has met since 2004.  A community advisory board and seven taskforces comprised of Coalition members will be created and meet during Year 1.  Years 2 and 3 implement a pilot intervention to test the efficacy of the patient navigator intervention.  A randomized controlled trial will be conducted.  Filipino American men and women ages 25-55 identified as hypertensive during community screenings will be randomized into a more intensive (n = 108) and less intensive (n = 108) patient navigator intervention.  The more intensive intervention will provide six protocolized sessions conducted by patient navigators; guided by the Health Belief Model and social support theory, sessions will focus on (a) providing information on high blood pressure and CVD, (b) linking and negotiating access to a primary care physician, (c) providing social support, and (d) assuring adherence to medication taking and appointment keeping.  A baseline and two follow-up interviews will be conducted to assess client outcomes, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and adherence to medication taking and appointment keeping. RELEVANCE: Filipino Americans exhibit high rates of hypertension and are therefore at high risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke.  However, few interventions have been developed and implemented for this population to address these concerns.  A patient navigator intervention, developed with community input to ensure its cultural and linguistic appropriateness, has the potential to prevent cardiovascular disease and stroke by helping Filipino Americans control their blood pressure.         ",Project AsPIRE (Asian American Partnerships in Research),7126463,R24MD001786,[''],NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R24,2006,622440,0.06559525417545169
"Cardiovascular Disease Trends in the Elderly DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite the recognition of cardiovascular disease (CVD) as a leading cause of mortality, this country lacks a cohesive, informative surveillance system that can provide insights into national patterns of care, reveal national trends over time, and track short- and long-term patient outcomes for elderly Americans. Most national estimates of CVD and outcomes have been based on extrapolating rates from a very small number of community studies or clinical studies that are restricted in terms of size, demographics, or geography. In addition, outcome measures have most often been limited to recurrent disease or death, and typically consider short-term outcomes (rarely beyond 12 to 24 months). Related vascular events and nonvascular events are rarely considered. This has resulted in significant data gaps. Defining patterns and trends of CVD, and identifying differences and disparities among diverse groups in terms of age, race, gender, clinical history, as well as different geographic regions of the United States should be a top research priority. We have created a population-based national cohort that will begin to fill these gaps in knowledge. The Cardiovascular Disease Trends in the Elderly Study will span 12 years and include all fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries discharged with CVD from 1991 through 2003. Accordingly, this study has the following specific aims: (1) Determine 12-year cardiovascular disease trends, especially by age, race, and gender subgroups, as well as region; (2) determine the short- and long-term outcomes for patients hospitalized with cardiovascular disease; and (3) determine the change in cost and outcomes for Medicare beneficiaries. This career development award will enable the candidate to build additional skills to link the complementary disciplines of clinical medicine, epidemiology, public health, biostatistics, and health economics to examine the burden of cardiovascular disease in the elderly. This unique perspective will provide valuable insights for policy makers and investigators in planning for the health care needs of patients with established cardiovascular disease.

"Poverty, Stress and Cardiovascular Disease DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Older women of low socioeconomic status (SES) have higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) than older women of high SES. This difference, a source of disparity in mortality and disability, is not explained by traditional CVD risk factors. Despite recent policy emphasis on health disparities, the Contributing biological mechanisms are largely unspecified. Differential stress experience between SES groups could affect CVD disparities. Allostatic load is a single parameter that represents the sum of multiple body system indicators and is theorized to be a cumulative measure of stress-related biological risk. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that allostatic load is a mediator between SES and incident CVD in a population of older women. The study will use data from the Women's Health and Aging Study 2, a 10 year longitudinal study of 436 women aged 70-79 years old at baseline. The socioeconomic diversity of the subjects and the range of biological data provided are ideal to test the candidate's hypotheses. Employing the theory of allostatic load in a sample of older women of a wide SES range may provide important insight into mechanisms contributing to the significant problem of health disparities in CVD.

"Stanford MKITS Science Program: CVD and Public Health DESCRIPTION  (provided by applicant): Background:  Only 0.5% of Native American, 16% of Latino, and 21% of African American high school graduates earn a college degree compared with 37% of White students, resulting in a critical shortage of underrepresented ethnic minorities in scientific and health careers.  Partners:  A partnership has been formed between an internationally renowned research program in cardiovascular disease (CVD) epidemiology at Stanford and science teachers from four California high schools.  Each school population is either predominantly rural Native American, rural Latino, urban Latino, or urban African American.  Curriculum:  We will develop and evaluate a curriculum focused on CVD, the scientific process, health disparities, health careers, and the college admissions process.  The major components of our program are school-based:  1) an academic-year science program for all interested juniors (10-25 students from each school for a total of 80 per year); and Stanford-based:  2) a one-day CVD and college guidance workshop each year for all science program students and their guidance counselors and parents; 3) a five-week CVD Summer Institute for selected science program students (about 5 students from each school for a total of 20 per year who will return to their schools as seniors to be teaching assistants); and 4) a one-week CVD Summer Institute for science teachers (1-3 teachers from each school for about 8 per year).  During the program, we will train 320 students overall and 100 students   intensively.  Focus:  The curriculum for both students and teachers will have a broad focus on CVD and public health.  It will be distinguished by:  hands-on CVD science demonstrations; community-based, culturally-relevant group research projects; interactions with biomedical research scientists; hospital and clinical field placements in the community and at Stanford; strong mentoring from Stanford faculty and students; individualized college and career guidance; technology training; and long-term student and institutional support.  Evaluation:  We will use process and outcome evaluation to assess teacher training, the curriculum implementation, student engagement in and knowledge about the scientific process, number of students entering college and scientific professions, and dissemination and sustainability of the program.  We will follow all students annually through college graduation and beyond using a telephone survey to provide long-term support and evaluate the numbers pursuing science majors in college and entering scientific and health careers.  Our new program will build on our highly successful 15-year-old summer academic enrichment program that has reached 333 low-income high school students.  Over 90% have been followed for up to 15 years; almost 100% have entered college.  Among college graduates, 11% are in or have completed medical school, 32% are in or have completed graduate school, 21% are employed in health careers, and 22% are employed in non-health jobs.

"Sociodemographic Regulation of CV Function and Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and their comorbidity pose important health challenges for the United States in the coming decades. African Americans (AAs) have a greater prevalence of T2D and have higher CVD and T2D related mortality rates compared with European Americans (EAs). Environmental stress has been postulated as playing an important role in the development of CVD and T2D, particularly among AAs, but little is known about underlying physiological mechanisms linking stress to early etiology of CVD and T2D. Assessment of possible differential impact of chronic environmental stress upon longitudinal development and manifestation of preclinical markers of CVD and T2D in AAs and EAs can be accomplished only with proper control for genetic influences. Employment of a genetically and environmentally informative twin study design enables genetic variation contributing to individual variation [heritability (h2)] to be controlled for and environmental influences [environmentality = 1-h2] to be quantified. The fundamental objective of this proposal is to identify whether exposure to chronic stress is associated with development of early risk markers of CVD and T2D and whether this differs between AAs and EAs. Collecting data on 2 additional occasions in the Georgia CV Twin study (523 pairs, 302 EA and 221 AA) who will be T9.5¿3.5 yrs old will yield 5 evaluations over a crucial time span capturing the transition from childhood into adulthood. Particularly informative will be addition of new indices of sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation (i.e., urinary excretion rate of norepinephrine and salivary cortisol), the metabolic syndrome (i.e., blood pressure, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, waist circumference, fasting glucose and insulin), environmental stress (e.g., childhood trauma, job strain, perceived discrimination and unfairness, community social status) and a measure of vascular function (i.e., arterial stiffness). Relevance to public health: lncreased understanding of the role of environmental stress related factors and their underlying physiological mechanisms as contributors to health disparities between AAs and EAs will assist in earlier and better identification of youth and young adults at increased risk for CVD and T2D. It will also aid the development of more personalized primary prevention programs involving lifestyle interventions in which the role of chronic stress will be taken into account to prevent early onset of these diseases.           ",Sociodemographic Regulation of CV Function and Structure,7258090,R01HL056622,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Employment ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Rate ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' allostatic load ', ' USA Georgia ', ' Western Asia Georgia ', ' Georgian SSR ', ' Georgian S.S.R.

"Cost-effective prevention of cardiovascular disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The purpose of this International Research Scientist Development Award is to prepare the applicant, Thomas A Gaziano, for a career as an independent investigator in cost-effective prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in developing countries. Dr. Gaziano proposes to devise a simple bloodless screening tool in two established cohorts in the US for predicting those at highest risk for CVD and then to assess the cost effectiveness of such a strategy in South Africa and India. Current international guidelines assess risk of CVD on the basis of multiple risk factors including cholesterol and diabetes status. However, the cost of blood testing and a lack of trained staff to obtain samples make these guidelines impractical in developing countries. The research plan consists of three specific aims. 1. To develop a simple screening mechanism with easily obtainable risk factors for CVD --age, tobacco, systolic blood pressure, and an obesity measure (BMI)-- and compare it to a commonly used tool requiring costly blood drawing of lipids and glucose in addition to age, tobacco status, and blood pressure. 2. To compare the two screening tools for CVD derived in specific aim 1 in a cost-effective analysis using the following strategies: screening without blood sampling, screening with blood sampling, and a third strategy of a two step process of first assessing risk with no blood testing to identify a subset of the population who might benefit from higher cost screening with blood testing.

"Heart Failure Disparities in Native Hawaiians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem leading to considerable cardiovascular morbidity &  mortality.  The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.  Partners of the HFD Program include:  MedStar Research Institute, Oahu-based Community Health Centers (CHCs) & the Hawaii EXPORT Center, an NIH-funded initiative addressing diabetes-associated disparities in NH/PP.  The HFD Program will achieve the following research & educational aims:  1) Determine the reliability & validity of echocardiograms performed by community-based health workers compared to a professionally trained sonographer as the ""gold standard"".  2) Determine if a culturally competent educational program for heart failure reduces HF hospitalizations & mortality compared to usual care.  3) Characterize ethnic differences in the heart failure syndrome in hospitalized NHs & PPs compared to Caucasians.  4) Construct HF pedigrees using probands identified at the QEC for a future HF linkage study in NHs & PPs.  5) Educate community-based health workers to perform echocardiography scans for the detection of HF in a high risk population of NHs & PPs.  6) Train new investigators to conduct  research focused on CVD disparities in general, and heart failure in particular.  By achieving these aims, the HFD Program will improve access to HF care at CHCs that serve NHs & PPs, fill a gap in knowledge of CVD disparities in NHs & PPs and provide a foundation for future studies on genetic determinants of HF.

"CULTURAL FACTORS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK IN MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial research indicates that Mexican Americans are excessively vulnerable to the metabolic syndrome, with recent studies reporting metabolic syndrome prevalence rates of 30% or higher in this population. Because of the modifiable nature of the underlying causes of the metabolic syndrome and its strong association with cardiovascular disease (CVD), a better understanding of why Mexican Americans are predisposed to this condition is essential in any attempt to eliminate current CVD risk disparities in this population. The long-term goal of this research proposal is to contribute to the literature on CVD disparities in this at-risk population and to assist in the effort to eliminate such disparities. Toward this goal, the proposed research will examine the degree to which culturally-relevant variables represent risk and resilient factors for the metabolic syndrome. First, exploratory analyses will be conducted to examine: a) the nature and distributions of cultural characteristics considered potentially relevant to disease risk and resilience, including acculturation, familism, fatalism, and religiosity, and their co-variation and associations with sociodemographic characteristics; b) the relationship between cultural characteristics and behavioral risk factors relevant to the metabolic syndrome (i.e., dietary factors; physical activity); c) the relationship between cultural characteristics and metabolic syndrome indicators; and d) whether behavioral factors help explain   (i.e., ""mediate"") the relationship between cultural characteristics and metabolic syndrome variables. The training goals and research aims of the proposed plan will be accomplished in the context of two studies. The first study will examine archival data from a pilot project (South San Diego Women's Health Study; PI: L.C. Gallo; N=146) that served as the foundation for a study of the role of stress, psychosocial resources, and emotional factors in SES and ethnic CVD disparities in middle aged Mexican American women (Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways; PI: L. C. Gallo; N = 200). The second study will be used to conduct a comprehensive examination of the proposed cultural framework. A more inclusive understanding of the relevance of acculturation and Mexican cultural characteristics can help preserve any potential resiliency that exists and/or contribute to culturally sensitive approaches to risk prevention and intervention in this population.                   ",CULTURAL FACTORS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK IN MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN,7231170,F31HL087732,"['Cultural Characteristics ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' Literature ', ' Mexican ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Training Activity ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Woman ', ' waist circumference ', ' Behavior ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' resilience ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' emotional factor ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2007,28477,0.092179239808787
"Morehouse-Emory Partnership to Reduce CV  Disparities The explosive epidemic of obesity that has occurred over the past decade has affected all segments of the population; but has had its most detrimental impact on high-risk ethnic populations. Despite the compelling evidence that obesity increases the risk of CVD mortality, the pathobiological pathways that mediate this increased risk remain to be further elucidated. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has recently been defined to capture the cluster of characteristics associated with obesity and high CVD risk. We are intrigued by the paradoxical observation that African-Americans (AA) have a lower prevalence of the MetS compared to whites despite a higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension. This observation suggests that current clinical criteria fail to identify obese AA at high risk for CVD. Further research in ethnic populations is necessary to guide more effective preventive interventions. It is postulated that ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD involve a complex interplay between behavioral, cultural, socio-economic and biological determinants. The theme of this Morehouse-Emory Partnership Program focuses on elucidating the etiologic basis of ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and discovering new intervention strategies to ameliorate CV health in all communities. The proposed Program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and develop effective therapeutic interventions by drawing upon the fields of physiology, biochemistry, vascular biology, psychology, public health, nursing and clinical medicine. In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's approach to elucidating ethnic disparities integrates the analysis of psycho-social parameters within the context of ethnic communities with the assessment of novel biomarkers and !assays of vascular function/structure that characterize differences in pathobiological pathways. This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between Emory University and the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM). In accordance with the RFA, the Program has at least four research-specific and two training-specific aims within Projects the subprojectsI and the shared resource Cores. Each project/core involves the synergy of a joint effort with investigators from both institutions. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Define the influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort. Aim 2: Define the effectiveness of a patient-centered lifestyle intervention to enhance the health of African-American patients with the metabolic syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices. Aim 3: To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans. Aim 4: To enhance the education/training of fellows/practitioners engaged in CVD disparities research/practice and promote partnerships that enhance cardiovascular health within ethnic communities.

"GENE/DIET EFFECTS ON PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the US and their risks are determined by non-modifiable (i.e., genetic) and modifiable factors (i.e., plasma lipid levels). It is well established that low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased CVD risk. A key determinant of HDL metabolism is hepatic lipase (HL), an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in lipoproteins. Within the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene at position -514 exists a common C/T polymorphism. The -514TT genotype is associated with an approximate 40% decrease in HL activity and increased HDL-C levels. However, this effect is variable among populations, suggesting gene- environment interactions. One of this grant's earlier key findings is that the -514 polymorphism shows a statistically significant interaction between HDL-C levels and dietary fat intake in Whites. Moreover, we replicated the findings in an Asian population. What remains to be demonstrated is whether these interactions occur when subjects modify their dietary fat intake and if so, what mechanisms are involved. Thus, the primary goal of this proposal is to use an interventional setting to thoroughly evaluate interactions between LIPC gene variants, changes in dietary fat intake and plasma lipid levels, inflammation markers and endothelial function. Moreover, we hypothesize that minorities, such as Hispanics, due to the enrichment of the -514 T allele (approximately 0.36) are more susceptible to the effects of these gene-diet interactions. Hence, we propose a randomized, cross over, two-phase diet intervention aimed at assessing the impact of consuming different levels of dietary fat (15% and 37%, respectively, 6 weeks each) on plasma HDL related measures in Caribbean Hispanic subjects (n=80; 40 CC and 40 TT). Our main hypothesis is that CC subjects respond to increases in the % of energy consumed as fat with increases in HDL-C levels. Conversely, in TT subjects, such dietary change results in decreases in HDL-C levels and worsening of endothelial function. Therefore, T subjects will have an elevated CVD risk when consuming high fat diets. Moreover, given the high frequency of the T allele in Hispanics, this interaction could account for some of the increase in CVD risk seen after acculturation. This evidence-based knowledge will contribute to a rational approach toward more effective dietary recommendations aimed to decrease health disparities and to a better CVD prevention.           ",GENE/DIET EFFECTS ON PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS,7263996,R01HL054776,"['Genetic Crossing Over ', ' nonsister chromatid exchange ', ' Crossing Over ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' human CETP protein ', ' human Lipid transfer protein I ', ' cholesteryl ester transfer protein, plasma, human ', ' Plasma Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein ', ' Lipid Transfer Protein I ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' dietary lipid ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' phosphatidylethanolamine ', ' O-(1-beta-acyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-ethanolamine ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data ', ' Degradation Pathway ', ' Degradative Pathway ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Statistically Significant ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Observational Study ', ' Phospholipid Degradation Pathway ', ' Phospholipid Degradation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Female ', ' Food ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hydrolysis ', ' Peripheral ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Chemicals ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' Lipoproteins ', ' High Density Lipoproteins ', ' alpha-Lipoproteins ', ' High density lipoprotein ', ' Heavy Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Lipoproteins ', ' HDL ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' Low-Density Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoproteins ', ' LDL Lipoproteins ', ' LDL ', ' Food Interactions ', ' nutrient interaction ', ' Lysophosphatidylcholines ', ' Lysolecithins ', ' anakinra ', ' urine-derived IL1 inhibitor ', ' urine interleukin 1 inhibitor ', ' urine IL-1 inhibitor ', ' interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein ', ' Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist ', ' IL1RN ', ' IL1 febrile inhibitor ', ' IL-1ra ', ' male ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity -

"The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significant disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, prevalence, and health outcomes persist among racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Although Healthy People 2010 (HP) and national clinical guidelines endorse lifestyle change for preventing and reducing CVD prevalence, numerous barriers limit health behavior change in many minority and low-income communities. New risk reduction strategies are needed using community-based participatory research (CBPR) techniques, which allow researchers and communities to combine their efforts promoting health, preventing disease, and reducing health disparities. Collaborative strategies must move beyond investigating behavior change alone and begin focusing on behavior change maintenance. The GoodNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness and Spiritual Growth) Trial is an 18-month effectiveness trial with an 18-month extended maintenance study, among 20 African-American and low- income congregations participating in the GoodNEWS faith-based lay health promotion program. After training, congregations will be randomized to either GoodNEWS with a health maintenance intervention (GoodNEWS-l) or GoodNEWS program alone (GoodNEWS-PA). The maintenance intervention combines elements of the medical care model and features of community-based support. Primary data collection will occur at baseline, 18, and 36 months with the two primary outcomes being levels of physical activity as measured by 7- Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) and dietary change as measured by the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). The primary hypothesis is that the maintenance group will significantly increase physical activity and healthy eating behavior compared to the program only group. We also hypothesize that lipoprotein and glucose levels, and blood pressure will be significantly improved over baseline in the GoodNEWS-l group and that these changes will be significantly greater than in the GoodNEWS-PA group. At the end of the trial, both groups will continue in an 18-month extended maintenance study. Relevance to Public Health: The GoodNEWS Trial is consistent with the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities. Lifestyle change is an important strategy for reducing CVD prevalence in high- risk populations. The proposed study will contribute to greater understanding of community-based health promotion and primary prevention strategies for reducing risk factors for heart disease and stroke in these populations, and maintaining lifestyle and behavior change over time.             ","The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial",7234616,R01HL087768,"['Data

CHD is the leading cause of CVD mortality in America, and Mississippi has the highest overall CVD mortality rate in the nation. Moreover, the cardiovascular health disparity between African Americans and whites is widening. Mississippi's CHD mortality rate is higher than the U.S. rate. African Americans have higher CHD prevalence and mortality rates than whites, and they also have a higher prevalence of risk factors associated with CHD such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity which clearly might influence the higher prevalence of CHD mortality. To achieve his research and career development goals, Dr. Sims will follow a career development plan at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, designed to provide knowledge, skills, and experience in 6 core competencies required to be a successful independent investigator in health disparities research: 1) research excellence in the area of CHD disparities, 2) advanced statistics and study design, 3) research ethics, 4) leadership and management, 5) presentation and teaching, and 6) scientific writing. This will be accomplished through implementation of an individualized learning plan that includes: 1) academic coursework to develop cardiovascular disease disparity research skills; 2) mentorship and consultation with nationally and internationally recognized experts in cardiovascular disease epidemiology and health disparities research; 3) mentorship by faculty sensitive to the unique needs and issues facing minority academic faculty; and 4) innovative research using a multi-dimensional framework for examining how CHD prevalence among African Americans is influence by neighborhood environments, perceived discrimination, stress, and social support. The proposed mentored research has three specific aims: 1) to examine the extent to which neighborhood SES is associated with CHD among African Americans; 2) to determine the degree to which perceived racial discrimination, stress and social support are associated with CHD among African Americans; and 3) to analyze the extent to which the association of neighborhood SES and CHD is mediated by psychosocial factors among African Americans. This is the first study of its kind to examine multiple pathways by which neighborhood SES and key psychosocial factors impact CHD risk in African Americans in Mississippi, a state with the highest CHD rate in the nation. This research will enable health-care providers to adequately serve their patients with CHD knowing that where they live and their exposure to discrimination, stress, and a lack of social support are sequelae to CHD. This research will also show which factors health policy makers need to focus on in order to address and eliminate CHD disparities.

"Health Disparities and CVD: Admixture Mapping in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic risk for complex processes like CVD appears to involve interactions among multiple genes of small effect. Association mapping is much more powerful than linkage mapping in identifying such genes, but requires 200-500 times as many markers to scan the genome. Admixture mapping can extract much of the power of association studies but requires genotyping only a few thousand markers genome-wide. This application partners Jackson Heart Study (JHS) investigators with two leaders in the field of admixture mapping, Drs. David Reich and Nick Patterson. The studies proposed will exploit the genotyping and analytic power of the Broad Institute to perform admixture mapping in the largest cohort ever assembled to study CVD in African Americans. Several factors contribute to the timeliness of this study and show the strength of the proposed research team: (a) Our group has published the first practical genetic resource for admixture mapping: 2,154 markers with large frequency differences between Africans and Europeans, and methods to analyze the data. (b) We have assembled a unique cohort for the largest-ever genome-wide admixture scan for CVD risk genes: 3,796 unrelated African Americans rigorously characterized for a large number of CVD phenotypes, including HTN, coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. (c) Admixture mapping has had its first empiric successes, localizing genes for hypertension and multiple sclerosis. Admixture mapping works in practice, making it critically important to apply it to seek CVD genes in the JHS cohort. We propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Whole-genome admixture scanning for CVD related genes. We will type 3,072 admixture mapping markers in DMA of 3,796 unrelated African American participants from the JHS cohort. We will concentrate our analyses on phenotypes with known differences in prevalence between African Americans and Europeans: hypertension, serum lipid levels, left ventricular hypertrophy, and low birth weight. Specific Aim 2: Follow-up and fine-mapping of the two strongest peaks of association. We will genotype 2,535 additional SNPs/peak in 940 participants (470 at each extreme for the selected phenotype). Specific Aim 3: Acquire all recorded birth weights for JHS participants. Birth weight will be analyzed both as a covariate for CVD phenotypes and as an independent phenotype, by admixture mapping. Lav language description: Finding genes that affect the risk of disease can identify new targets for drug treatment and lead to the development of important medical tests. These studies will seek genes of African and European origin that cause heart and blood vessel diseases in African Americans.           ",Health Disparities and CVD: Admixture Mapping in the Jackson Heart Study,7234028,R01HL084107,"['Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Genome Scan ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' positional cloning ', ' reverse genetics ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Age ', ' density ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Family Study ', ' Invasive ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Institutes ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Lipids ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Morbidity -

"Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) populations show disproportionate rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, and eliminating these disparities is a priority objective of Healthy People 2010. Previous research suggests that in addition to many other variables, psychosocial factors may contribute to CVD disparities. The proposed research will use the Reserve Capacity Model (Gallo and Matthews, 2003) as a conceptual framework through which to examine the roles of stress, psychosocial resources, and emotional factors in SES and ethnic CVD disparities, in a community-based random sample of middle-aged, Mexican-American and non-Latino White women with relatively low and high SES (N=300). The Reserve Capacity Model posits that individuals with lower social status (low SES, minority ethnicity) may suffer negative emotional and physical health consequences due to stress experienced across multiple domains. Stress may exert direct effects on behavioral and physiological risk processes, or it may influence emotional variables which are themselves putative CVD risk factors. In addition, persons with low social status may maintain a smaller bank of resilient psychosocial resources with which to manage stress, making them especially vulnerable to concomitant physical and emotional wear and tear. The effects of low SES may be amplified in Latino women (i.e., synergistic effects). However, Mexican-American women could also benefit from resilient, socio-cultural resources that protect them, to some extent, from stress. In the current study, women will undergo a comprehensive assessment of SES, psychosocial factors, physiological and behavioral risk factors, and CVD biomarkers, and will participate in a two-day evaluation of ambulatory blood pressure and psychosocial experiences assessed via ecological momentary assessment. By examining potentially modifiable psychosocial variables as a pathway underlying CVD disparities, this study seeks to inform efforts to understand and eliminate health disparities.           ",Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways,7225526,R01HL081604,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Social Network ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' allostatic load ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hostility ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' optimism ', ' postiive attitude ', ' Lipids ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Metabolic ', ' Daily ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' self esteem ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' day ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' experience ', ' cysteine rich protein ', ' Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ', ' ICAM-1 ', ' Glycoprotein ICAM 1 (human clone pHRVr1 deblocked protein moiety reduced) ', ' CD54 Antigens ', ' CD54 (ICAM 1) ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Social status ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stress ', ' Communities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' emotional factor ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2007,608952,0.08544414547675676

"Relationship of Blood Esterases, Pesticide Exposure and Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for an R21 grant is designed to solidify an interdisciplinary team of basic and clinical researchers in the Center for Environmental Health Sciences at Mississippi State University for research into the environmental factors contributing to the higher mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Deep South and among African Americans, and to position this team for participation in larger-scale on- going multi-institutional epidemiological studies. This health disparity in CVD is logically related to risk factors more prevalent in the South (which has a higher proportion of African Americans than other regions in the country.) The South is rural and highly agricultural, so the Southern populations would be expected to be routinely exposed to higher levels of pesticides than populations in many other regions. We hypothesize the following: The effects of pesticide exposure contribute to the development of CVD and are more pronounced in the African American population. Two enzymes that we have studied for many years because of their involvement in the detoxication of many pesticides are paraoxonase (PON1) and carboxylesterase (CaE). The former is known to be associated with HDL particles and the latter has recently been identified as a cholesteryl ester hydrolase that is involved in reverse cholesterol transport; therefore, both of these enzymes are involved in vascular health, and are potential biomarkers of susceptibility to CVD. We have experience biomonitoring urinary pesticide metabolites as an index of current pesticide exposure. We have developed a novel geospatial analysis of pesticide harvested crop records that predicts pesticide exposure to individuals for the previous 35 years of their lives. We have experience in cardiology and access to patients in a cardiology practice. We propose a pilot study to investigate the above listed parameters (i.e., PON1 and CaE in the blood and pesticide metabolites in the urine) of subjects recruited from the cardiology practice, and to calculate strength of associations among these factors, the degree of cardiovascular disease and the pesticide exposure estimated in the geospatial analysis model. This pilot study will be conducted following a year of planning, solidifying the interdisciplinary team, optimizing assays, and developing interactions with the project's consultants. The pilot study will position us to participate in a far more extensive study through interactions with our consultants at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In addition, we anticipate that we will develop more simplified assay methods for PON1 and CaE that will be more amenable for use as a clinical biomarker.              ","Relationship of Blood

"Reducing CVD risk and health disparities through active living neighborhoods    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer and diabetes are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States, yet we are ineffective in preventing these costly and debilitating chronic conditions. Although programs and strategies to improve behavioral screening and counseling are needed, health care interventions alone are inadequate for preventing CVD and other chronic diseases. Consistent with social ecological models, which point to the importance of multi-level influences on health, research on the impact of the built environment on CVD risk behaviors offers a compelling case for building ""active living"" into neighborhoods as an effective community-based CVD prevention strategy. The Stapleton development is the largest urban renewal project currently ongoing in the United States. Located on the vacated Stapleton Airport grounds in Denver, Stapleton's redevelopment began in 2001 by Forest City Enterprises, the developer hired to lead this multi-decade effort. Its 4,700 acres (of which more than one third is dedicated to green space) are designed as mixed-use neighborhoods to enhance active living with pocket parks, walking and bicycle trails and wide sidewalks and its community recreation facilities. Currently Stapleton has almost 1,500 families, and in 10 years will be home to over 30,000 residents. Importantly, its close proximity to adjacent neighborhoods that are racially and ethnically diverse and socio-economically disadvantaged, offers access to active living amenities to residents who previously experienced over 40 years of airport noise, traffic and pollution. This development of a new urban enclave with an established built environment is an unusual circumstance that presents exceptional opportunities for learning about community development and its impact on health and health disparities both in the new community and in the established communities surrounding it. Our proposed project fits with recent recommendations to increase knowledge of the impacts of population-based approaches for preventing cardiovascular disease. We will use community- and culturally-relevant data collection methods to understand how to increase use of Stapleton's active living environment to improve levels of physical activity and cardiovascular risk by residents of Stapleton and the diverse communities adjacent to it. An important resource for this research will be a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process that involves diverse residents of Stapleton and surrounding neighborhoods (hereinafter called the Greater Stapleton Community) in addressing these complex issues. Although Stapleton included community input early in its planning process, this project's establishment of a formalized CBPR process creates a more community-wide approach for building a diverse and ""permeable"" active living community.

"Project AsPIRE (Asian American Partnerships in Research)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The overall goal of this three-year planning grant is to improve health access and status for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Filipino Americans living in the New York City metropolitan area through the use of patient navigators. This application has four specific aims: (1) to create an infrastructure that facilitates the conduct of community-based participatory research (CBPR), (2) to conduct a descriptive study that examines the Filipino American community's knowledge, health practices, health access, and risk factors for CVD, (3) to conduct an experimental study to assess the efficacy of an intensive patient navigator intervention in improving health access and status for CVD among Filipino Americans, and (4) to evaluate CBPR as an approach for addressing and eliminating health disparities. Year 1 focuses on partnership development and creation, with community participation, of a patient navigator intervention to improve hypertension control in Filipino Americans.  The Kalusugan (i.e., ""health"" in Pilipino) Coalition-comprised of academic and community partners serving the Filipino American community-has met since 2004.  A community advisory board and seven taskforces comprised of Coalition members will be created and meet during Year 1.  Years 2 and 3 implement a pilot intervention to test the efficacy of the patient navigator intervention.  A randomized controlled trial will be conducted.  Filipino American men and women ages 25-55 identified as hypertensive during community screenings will be randomized into a more intensive (n = 108) and less intensive (n = 108) patient navigator intervention.  The more intensive intervention will provide six protocolized sessions conducted by patient navigators; guided by the Health Belief Model and social support theory, sessions will focus on (a) providing information on high blood pressure and CVD, (b) linking and negotiating access to a primary care physician, (c) providing social support, and (d) assuring adherence to medication taking and appointment keeping.  A baseline and two follow-up interviews will be conducted to assess client outcomes, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure and adherence to medication taking and appointment keeping. RELEVANCE: Filipino Americans exhibit high rates of hypertension and are therefore at high risk for cardiovascular disease and stroke.  However, few interventions have been developed and implemented for this population to address these concerns.  A patient navigator intervention, developed with community input to ensure its cultural and linguistic appropriateness, has the potential to prevent cardiovascular disease and stroke by helping Filipino Americans control their blood pressure.         ",Project AsPIRE (Asian American Partnerships in Research),7246483,R24MD001786,"['health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' High Blood Pressure ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Client ', ' Communities ', ' Community Participation ', ' community living ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' community based participatory research ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Address ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Rate ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Age ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Area ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Interview ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Individual ', ' Linguistics ', ' Linguistic ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York City ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Appointment ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' United States ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Woman ', ' Country ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' American ', ' Filipino American ', ' metropolitan ', ' blood pressure regulation ', ' blood pressure homeostasis ', ' blood pressure control ', ' BP control ', ' member ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' ']",NIMHD,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R24,2007,862006,0.06559525417545169
"Subclinical CVD in African American Type 2 Diabetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term objective of the African American-Diabetes Heart Study is to identify the causes of the markedly lower amounts of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in African American (AA) subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), relative to European Americans (EA). Additional goals are to evaluate the impacts of lifestyle, environment and inherited factors on the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to identify genomic regions contributing to the inherited component of subclinical CVD in AAs with T2DM. These goals will be achieved by the concerted efforts of clinicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, biochemists, and molecular geneticists, building on work that was previously performed in the parent Diabetes Heart Study (DHS). Specifically, we will ascertain, phenotype, and collect DMA from an additional 566 unrelated AAs with T2DM, combining their information with 90 unrelated AA diabetic subjects previously recruited into the DHS (656 subjects total). Clinical risk factor profiles will be created for each participant and we will assess subclinical and clinical CVD using Multi-Detector Row Computed Tomography of the coronary and carotid arteries and infra-renal aorta. We will next examine the impact of conventional CVD risk factors (smoking, lipids and lipoproteins, hypertension and glycemic control) and novel risk factors (sex hormones and other endocrine measures, calcium regulating hormones, calcification inhibitors and inflammatory biomarkers) on the development of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in AAs with T2DM. We will investigate ethnic differences in calcified atheromatous plaque by comparing the above results with those obtained in a matched cohort of EA subjects with T2DM from the parent DHS. In years 4 and 5, we will screen the genome using Mapping by Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium (MALD) in an expanded sample of 1,100 unrelated AA subjects with T2DM (444 previously recruited in existing studies and 656 locally recruited) to locate genomic regions that harbor calcified atherosclerotic plaque susceptibility genes in the diabetic AA population. These strategies will provide novel information on causes of the marked ethnic disparity in subclinical CVD, will assist in identifying genes that predispose to CVD in AA subjects with T2DM, and may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies to prevent hardening of the arteries.              ",Subclinical CVD in African American Type 2

"The Emory-Morehouse Partnership to Reduce CV Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Over the past decade, there has been an explosive increase in obesity among all age groups within the US population.  This epidemic is particularly problematic among African-Americans in the Southeast. Although genetic factors play a contributory role, it is postulated that ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) is related to a dynamic interplay between biological factors and the behavioral response to the unique environmental context within ethnic communities. Obesity is often associated with perturbations in the metabolic and physiologic milieu.  A cluster of obesity-related abnormalities has been defined as the ""Metabolic Syndrome"".  The CVD complications of obesity appears to be related to the capacity for adipose tissue itself to generate ""adipokines"" that   directly predispose to insulin-resistance, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and vascular disease. The proposed program will use state-of-the-art approaches to define potential ethnic differences in the profile of metabolic, physiologic and biochemical features associated with obesity as well as the salutary responses to lifestyle modification.  The proposed program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize potential ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD by drawing upon the fields of psychology, physiology, biochemistry, nursing and clinical medicine.  In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's research plan ranges from:  epidemiology studies within the ethnic communities, to patient-centered clinical trial interventions within ethnic community practices, tothe analysis of novel biomarkers of human pathobiology.  This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between the Morehouse School of Medicine and Emory University.  This partnership shares a joint commitment to address the striking ethnic disparities in the high-risk CVD population that we serve.  The specific aims are:  Aim 1:  Define the relative influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort.  Aim 2:  Define the effectiveness of patient-targeted behavioral interventions to enhance the health of African-American patients with the   Metabolic Syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices.  Aim 3:  To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans.  Aim 4:  To enhance the education/training of fellows/practitioners engaged in CVD disparities research/practice and promote partnerships that enhance cardiovascular health within ethnic communities.

"Reducing Total Cardiovascular Risk in an Urban Community The proposed study is based on the premise that a community based participatory research partnership model using a team of an advanced practice nurse case manager, community health worker (CHW), and physician can be translated into urban community clinics and improve the quality of care and reduce disparities in cardiovascular health in minority and other underserved populations. Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of CVD risk-reducing practices remains poor. In spite of the known benefit of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dl in persons with existing heart disease, as many as 50-70% of eligible CVD patients are not placed on lipid-lowering therapy by their providers and from 20-80% of patients do not achieve the goals of therapy. The benefits of controlling high blood pressure (HBP) are well established yet national rates of HBP control remain at only 3 1% despite decades of provider and patient education. In addition, it is well established that control of glycemia, hyperlipidemia, and blood pressure reduce the risk of vascular complications in people with diabetes, 75% of whom die from some form of heart or blood vessel disease. This randomized trial will compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive intensive intervention (Cl) with a less intensive intervention (LI) in African American (AA), and White low income patients with known excessive CVD risk. A total of 500 eligible patients with CVD or type 2 diabetes (250 AA and 250 White) will be randomly selected from two urban federally-funded community clinics and randomly assigned to receive either 1) a Cl delivered by a nurse practitioner, a CHW, and the patient's physician, focusing on behavioral interventions to affect therapeutic lifestyle changes and medication adherence as well as the prescription and titration of medications or 2) a LI intervention providing feedback on CVD risk factors and guidelines to patients and their physicians. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, one and two years. It is hypothesized that a higher proportion of patients in the Cl group will achieve the treatment goals for lipid, blood pressure, and diabetes management, lifestyle behaviors and utilization of antiplatelet agent, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor therapies and that the Cl intervention wilj be cost-effective. Secondary outcomes include assessment of the impact of the Cl model on patients' satisfaction with care and health care utilization. The proposed increase in the percentage of high-risk women and men who receive recommended secondary prevention therapies and achieve goal levels could potentially result in a marked decrement in annual CVD mortality and health disparities if applied within primary care settings to populations with the characteristics of the target groups for this study.

"Autonomic function and insulin resistance in a multiethnic population    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant):  Autonomic nervous system regulation of heartbeat variability is often disrupted among patients with diabetes.  Moreover, reduced heart rate variability has been associated with increased Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) mortality among diabetic and non-diabetic populations.  CVD mortality rates differ greatly among many ethnic groups.  In Hawaii, Native Hawaiians have been shown to have disproportionately higher CVD mortality than Asian and Caucasian groups.  Preliminary data from the Native Hawaiian Health Research Project suggest that conventional risk factors associated with Atherosclerosis may not fully account for ethnic disparities in heart disease and stroke mortality rates in Hawaii.  Insulin resistance has been associated with increased CVD incidence and mortality, and has also been associated with reduced heart rate variability.  The proposed study will investigate the relationship between insulin resistance and autonomic regulation of cardiac function in a multi-ethnic population.  The proposed research will also provide baseline data for future longitudinal studies that will investigate the extent to which these novel risk factors explain ethnic disparities in CVD mortality in Hawaii.  The findings of the proposed study may have important implications with regards to the treatment of insulin resistance as an independent CVD risk factor.      Specific Aims:  Collaborator component (Aim #1).  Establish a collaborative laboratory in Hawaii for the evaluation of autonomic function in a multiethnic population.  Principal Investigator component (Aim #2).  Investigate the relationship between insulin resistance, body-fat distribution, and autonomic function.  (Aim #3) Establish a cohort with baseline measures of autonomic function and insulin resistance that will serve as a study population for R01-supported longitudinal studies.  Hypotheses:  By fulfilling these specific aims, we propose to test the following specific research hypotheses:  (1.) Autonomic function will differ significantly by ethnicity, after adjustment for age, gender, body-mass index, and central obesity.  (2.) Insulin resistance is independently associated with autonomic function, after an adjustment for age, gender, body-mass index, and central obesity.  Secondary Questions:  Does insulin resistance and plasma glucose interact, in their effects on autonomic function?  What role do plasma lipids, blood pressure, diet, and physical activity have in explaining any observed ethnic disparities in autonomic function?  Is the questionnaire-derived Composite Autonomic Symptom Scale (COMPASS) correlated with autonomic function in Hawaii's multiethnic population?         ",Autonomic function and insulin resistance in a multiethnic population,7276124,S11NS043364,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetic Neuropathies ', ' diabetes-associated neuropathy ', ' Diet ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Symptoms ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Clinical Assessment Tool ', ' trend ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Cardiac ', ' Future ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Age ', ' glucose tolerance ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lipids ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' diabetic ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' autonomic neuropathy ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Collaborations ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Patients ', ' Central obesity ', ' waist-predominant obesity ', ' visceral obesity ', ' trunk obesity ', ' male-type obesity ', ' excess adiposity in midsection ', ' Truncal obesity ', ' Obesity of face and trunk, sparing limbs ', ' Obese face+trunk sparing limbs ', ' Fat body with thin limbs ', ' Centripetal obesity ', ' Android fat distribution ', ' Abdominal obesity ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Play ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Body fat ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Caucasians ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Severities ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cohort ', ' Proxy ', ' novel ', ' Population Study ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Autonomic Dysfunction ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Regulation ', ' Sampling ', ' Accounting ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' non-diabetic ', ' nondiabetic ', ' intravenous glucose tolerance ', ' ']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII AT MANOA,S11,2007,322121,0.09313801943897597

"Heart Failure Disparities in Native Hawaiians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem leading to considerable cardiovascular morbidity &  mortality.  The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.  Partners of the HFD Program include:  MedStar Research Institute, Oahu-based Community Health Centers (CHCs) & the Hawaii EXPORT Center, an NIH-funded initiative addressing diabetes-associated disparities in NH/PP.  The HFD Program will achieve the following research & educational aims:  1) Determine the reliability & validity of echocardiograms performed by community-based health workers compared to a professionally trained sonographer as the ""gold standard"".  2) Determine if a culturally competent educational program for heart failure reduces HF hospitalizations & mortality compared to usual care.  3) Characterize ethnic differences in the heart failure syndrome in hospitalized NHs & PPs compared to Caucasians.  4) Construct HF pedigrees using probands identified at the QEC for a future HF linkage study in NHs & PPs.  5) Educate community-based health workers to perform echocardiography scans for the detection of HF in a high risk population of NHs & PPs.  6) Train new investigators to conduct research focused on CVD disparities in general, and heart failure in particular.  By achieving these aims, the HFD Program will improve access to HF care at CHCs that serve NHs & PPs, fill a gap in knowledge of CVD disparities in NHs & PPs and provide a foundation for future studies on genetic determinants of HF.

"Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetic Nephropathy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Hispanics are the largest ethnic minority group in the country and MA constitute almost 80% of Hispanics in California.  MA have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and a higher risk for diabetic nephropathy (DN).  Paradoxically, data including our own suggest that CVD burden may be lower in MA than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW).  We seek to define the CVD burden (coronary artery calcification, CAC) and its determinants in a high-risk sub-group of non-dialyzed diabetics with DN (125 MA, 125 NHW), in order to test three hypotheses:  1) Among individuals with DN, the CAC scores in MA are lower and progress more slowly, than among NHW; 2) The socioeconomic status (SES) of MA individuals with DN is significantly lower than of NHW; and 3) Among individuals with DN, MA have a lower all-cause and CVD mortality.  Ten routinely measured, two additional CVD risk factors (homocysteine, leptin) and three SES variables, pre-specified for primary analyses, will be ascertained at baseline, 12 and 24 months.  CAC will be ascertained by electron beam computerized tomography at baseline and 24 months.  The relationship of CVD risk factors and SES variables that vary by ethnicity will be tested for their contribution to ethnic differences in CAC.  The entire cohort will be followed from enrollment till the end of the grant period to ascertain ethnic differences in all-cause and CVD mortality; a high event rate in this population provides power to test the hypotheses thus proposed.  A rigorous plan for complete follow-up is proposed.  Thus, this study will define for the first time the comparative atherosclerotic burden in MA and NHW with DN and the potential role of several CVD risk factors.  It will test the novel hypothesis that despite medical and SES factors that might increase the risk for CVD mortality in MA, the opposite may be true.  Identifying health-care disparities will permit us to design targeted interventions to improve the health of ethnic minorities.  Recognition of factors associated with the lower CVD risk among MA or the higher risk among NHW may help develop therapies that may potentially reduce the CVD burden among patients with DN.  The applicant has institutional support and a career development plan including obtaining a Masters in Clinical Investigation, to achieve his career goals.

"Healthy Bodies, Healthy Hearts after Menopause    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Margaret (Molly) B. Conroy is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. She is applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) in order to become an independent clinical investigator. Her proposal focuses on the relationships between physical activity, abdominal and muscular adiposity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women after menopause. Women are a high-risk population, as they are more likely to be physically inactive than men, a disparity that becomes more striking with advancing age. Following menopause, the incidence of CVD in women increases, while participation in regular physical activity declines. Further investigation is warranted of the pathways through which physical activity impacts CVD risk after menopause, particularly those incorporating body composition and potentially modifiable psychosocial factors. Dr. Conroy will examine these relationships and implement and evaluate a physical activity intervention in a clinical setting by pursuing three specific aims. Aim #1 will determine whether abdominal and muscular adiposity mediate the relationship between physical activity and subclinical cardiovascular disease risk in a cohort of postmenopausal women. Aim #2 will examine the relationships between changes in physical activity, abdominal and muscular adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk after an intensive lifestyle intervention. Aim #3 will involve a randomized, controlled physical activity intervention for early postmenopausal women that adapts clinical trial methods and translates them to the primary care patient population and practice setting. Aim #1 will be addressed by an ancillary study in the Women on the Move through Activity and Nutrition (WOMAN) cohort. Aim #2 will be addressed in the Slow Adverse Vascular Effects (SAVE) study. Aim #3 wiN be addressed by recruiting an intervention cohort from Dr. Conroy's primary care clinic. Experts in the fields of physical activity and CVD epidemiology, translational research, behavioral medicine and intervention design will supervise Dr. Conroy's career development.

"Health Disparities and CVD: Admixture Mapping in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic risk for complex processes like CVD appears to involve interactions among multiple genes of small effect. Association mapping is much more powerful than linkage mapping in identifying such genes, but requires 200-500 times as many markers to scan the genome. Admixture mapping can extract much of the power of association studies but requires genotyping only a few thousand markers genome-wide. This application partners Jackson Heart Study (JHS) investigators with two leaders in the field of admixture mapping, Drs. David Reich and Nick Patterson. The studies proposed will exploit the genotyping and analytic power of the Broad Institute to perform admixture mapping in the largest cohort ever assembled to study CVD in African Americans. Several factors contribute to the timeliness of this study and show the strength of the proposed research team: (a) Our group has published the first practical genetic resource for admixture mapping: 2,154 markers with large frequency differences between Africans and Europeans, and methods to analyze the data. (b) We have assembled a unique cohort for the largest-ever genome-wide admixture scan for CVD risk genes: 3,796 unrelated African Americans rigorously characterized for a large number of CVD phenotypes, including HTN, coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. (c) Admixture mapping has had its first empiric successes, localizing genes for hypertension and multiple sclerosis. Admixture mapping works in practice, making it critically important to apply it to seek CVD genes in the JHS cohort. We propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Whole-genome admixture scanning for CVD related genes. We will type 3,072 admixture mapping markers in DMA of 3,796 unrelated African American participants from the JHS cohort. We will concentrate our analyses on phenotypes with known differences in prevalence between African Americans and Europeans: hypertension, serum lipid levels, left ventricular hypertrophy, and low birth weight. Specific Aim 2: Follow-up and fine-mapping of the two strongest peaks of association. We will genotype 2,535 additional SNPs/peak in 940 participants (470 at each extreme for the selected phenotype). Specific Aim 3: Acquire all recorded birth weights for JHS participants. Birth weight will be analyzed both as a covariate for CVD phenotypes and as an independent phenotype, by admixture mapping. Lav language description: Finding genes that affect the risk of disease can identify new targets for drug treatment and lead to the development of important medical tests. These studies will seek genes of African and European origin that cause heart and blood vessel diseases in African Americans.           ",Health Disparities and CVD: Admixture Mapping in the Jackson Heart Study,7430295,R01HL084107,"['Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Genome Scan ', ' Rate ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' positional cloning ', ' reverse genetics ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Age ', ' density ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Family Study ', ' Invasive ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Institutes ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Lipids ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Morbidity -

"Northern Manhattan Healthy Heart Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northern Manhattan Healthy Heart Initiative (NMHHI) is in response to the NHLBI's interest in interventions that address multiple risk factors for people at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and utilizes the existing framework for community based participatory research in our NIH funded Center of Excellence on Health Disparities Research. We propose to examine the effectiveness of a Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention in CVD risk reduction among Caribbean Latinos. Although CHWs programs have exited in the US for over 4 decades, numerous recent reviews continue to identify the lack of rigorous evaluation data as the primary barrier limiting the dissemination of CHW programs. Our proposal addresses specific research priority needs of our community planning council. Our community partners participated in all aspects of the proposal including conception, jointly formulating the study design, and developing and writing major sections of the study intervention. The study design is a randomized controlled trial of 800 Latino patients aged 35-65 with hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia being cared at 7 primary care sites. The study builds on a successful diabetes CHW program previously developed by our community partners and our medical center. The Specific Aim is to determine if a community based CHW intervention results in lowering of CVD risk factors at 18 months as measured by the Total Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Additional primary outcomes include blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. Secondary objectives will determine if the CHW intervention results in improvements in the following putative mechanisms that may influence the FRS: 1) Medication adherence; 2) Improvements in diet and exercise; and 3) Self efficacy, all measured using culturally validated instruments. At study conclusion we will also examine the cost effectiveness of our intervention. Our CHW intervention uses the Chronic Care Model as an overarching framework and builds on existing programmatic strengths at each CBO. Our two community partners will have a major role in this application including primary responsibly for subject recruitment, hiring and training the CHWs, delivering the CHW intervention, and collaborating on study finding dissemination. This is reflected in the budget, half of which is to the community partners. The dissemination activities to be undertaken by our team will prioritize developing mechanisms for the sustainability of the CHW intervention including discussions with our local Medicaid managed care plans which have ongoing interests in innovative cost-effective culturally appropriate health care delivery models such as CHWs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart disease is the leading cause of death among Hispanics. Hispanics also have many risk factors for heart disease. Our study will determine if community health workers can reduce the risk of heart disease among Caribbean Latinos living in Northern Manhattan.                            ",Northern Manhattan Healthy Heart Initiative,7428746,R01HL083857,"['Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Dominican ', ' Caribbean natives ', ' Elements ', ' Address ', ' Dose ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Caring ', ' Data ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Study Section ', ' Clinical Trials Design ', ' trial design ', ' Monitor ', ' Rate ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Adoption ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Standards of Weights and Measures ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' community planning ', ' concept ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Au element ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' hypercholesterolemia ', ' Hypercholesteremia ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' Specified ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Hypotension ', ' Vascular Hypotensive Disorder ', ' Low Blood Pressure ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Latin America ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Numbers ', ' Lipids ', ' Low-Density Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoproteins ', ' LDL Lipoproteins ', ' LDL ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' Funding ', ' Medicaid ', ' Cardiovascular Models ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Daily ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' instrument ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Research Priority ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Level of Evidence ', ' Urban Health ', ' Vegetables ', ' dietary vegetable ', ' Voice ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Writing ', ' Week ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Score ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' interest ', ' inner city ', ' Medical center ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Budgets ', ' Participant ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Managed Care ', ' Self Management ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' cost ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' diet and exercise ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' chronic care model ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Conceptions ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' heart disease risk ', ' heart disorder risk ', ' cardiac disorder risk ', ' cardiac disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' ']",NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,R01,2008,710064,0.07319299106637979
"Can CHW/PS Promote Lifestyle and Environment Changes to Reduce CVD Risk in Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HEART (Heath Education Assessment Research Team) Phase 2 is a community-based participatory research continuation project whose overall goal is to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Hispanics in El Paso, Texas using the community health workers/promotores de salud (CHW/PS) model. In HEART Phase 1 we: 1) developed a Community Health Advisory Committee (CHAC) to lead the participatory research process and guide additional means to obtain community input; 2) performed a community needs assessment to direct the research process; and 3) conducted a four-month CHW7PS pilot intervention (group classes and follow-up) to identify an optimal CHW/PS outreach approach. In addition to the lifestyle changes promoted in our pilot study, the HEART Phase 2 will add a fitness component and include a focus on the environment that contributes to CVD risk. Two new community partners have been added to emphasize our fitness and environmental approach: the YWCA facility in the Lower Valley and after-school programs available at both the YWCA and through the City of El Paso Parks and Recreation Department. We plan to foster the sustained integration of the CHW/PS model in these new community based organizations (CBOs) and public sector settings through increased organizational experience and knowledge regarding culturally-tailored lifestyle and environmental interventions. Most importantly, we will conduct an intervention in the Lower Valley of Et Paso that will build on our pilot study. Our culturally sensitive programming will be known as Mi Corazon, Mi Comunidad (My Heart, My Community). The goals of the intervention will be to 1) increase awareness and utilization of programs by Hispanic families living in the target community; 2) increase health behaviors including intentions and self-efficacy, and 3) decrease CVD risk factors among Hispanic families. Through our combined approach and with the continuous input from the CHAC, we will impact change agents, stakeholders, organizations, individuals and families. Lastly, we will define and promote a policy agenda that targets integration of CHW/PS in CBOs and public sector programs in conjunction with a dissemination plan to share our findings with a broader audience, thereby improving lifestyle and environmental factors that impact CVD risk factors for Hispanics in El Paso, Texas.          ",Can CHW/PS Promote Lifestyle and Environment Changes to Reduce CVD Risk in Texas,7493817,R24MD001785,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Family ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Sector ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Texas ', ' Awareness ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Class ', ' Behavior ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' outreach ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' environmental change ', ' environmental intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' service utilization ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R24,2008,572906,0.12143989664171076
"Morehouse-Emory Partnership to Reduce CV  Disparities The explosive epidemic of obesity that has occurred over the past decade has affected all segments of the population; but has had its most detrimental impact on high-risk ethnic populations. Despite the compelling evidence that obesity increases the risk of CVD mortality, the pathobiological pathways that mediate this increased risk remain to be further elucidated. The metabolic syndrome (MetS) has recently been defined to capture the cluster of characteristics associated with obesity and high CVD risk. We are intrigued by the paradoxical observation that African-Americans (AA) have a lower prevalence of the MetS compared to whites despite a higher prevalence of obesity and hypertension. This observation suggests that current clinical criteria fail to identify obese AA at high risk for CVD. Further research in ethnic populations is necessary to guide more effective preventive interventions. It is postulated that ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD involve a complex interplay between behavioral, cultural, socio-economic and biological determinants. The theme of this Morehouse-Emory Partnership Program focuses on elucidating the etiologic basis of ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and discovering new intervention strategies to ameliorate CV health in all communities. The proposed Program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD and develop effective therapeutic interventions by drawing upon the fields of physiology, biochemistry, vascular biology, psychology, public health, nursing and clinical medicine. In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's approach to elucidating ethnic disparities integrates the analysis of psycho-social parameters within the context of ethnic communities with the assessment of novel biomarkers and !assays of vascular function/structure that characterize differences in pathobiological pathways. This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between Emory University and the Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM). In accordance with the RFA, the Program has at least four research-specific and two training-specific aims within Projects the subprojectsI and the shared resource Cores. Each project/core involves the synergy of a joint effort with investigators from both institutions. The specific aims are: Aim 1: Define the influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort. Aim 2: Define the effectiveness of a patient-centered lifestyle intervention to enhance the health of African-American patients with the metabolic syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices. Aim 3: To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans. Aim 4: To enhance the education/training of fellows/practitioners engaged in CVD disparities research/practice and promote partnerships that enhance cardiovascular health within ethnic communities.

"Minority Predoctoral Fellowship Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) affects a significant proportion (28.5%) of the U.S population, resulting in high rates of mortality and significant heath care costs. Certain related conditions, such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and behaviors, such as inactivity and diet, may exacerbate the onset or effects of CVD. Preventive care can reduce these risk factors; research has found that early detection, treatment and control of CVD risk factors significantly reduce mortality and morbidity. However, a number of significant health disparities exist in the area of preventive care, including disparities in counseling and in orders for diagnostic tests. I intend to investigate provider contributions to preventive care disparities for cardiovascular disease,  using physician race and gender as independent variables. A hypothesized mechanism (presented by Van Ryn, 2002) through which provider factors could influence race/ethnicity disparities in treatments received will be used to further explain the phenomenon. Several mediating variables (patient-provider interactions and communication) will be used to explain relationships between physician race and gender and the outcome variables.

"Sociodemographic Regulation of CV Function and Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and their comorbidity pose important health challenges for the United States in the coming decades. African Americans (AAs) have a greater prevalence of T2D and have higher CVD and T2D related mortality rates compared with European Americans (EAs). Environmental stress has been postulated as playing an important role in the development of CVD and T2D, particularly among AAs, but little is known about underlying physiological mechanisms linking stress to early etiology of CVD and T2D. Assessment of possible differential impact of chronic environmental stress upon longitudinal development and manifestation of preclinical markers of CVD and T2D in AAs and EAs can be accomplished only with proper control for genetic influences. Employment of a genetically and environmentally informative twin study design enables genetic variation contributing to individual variation [heritability (h2)] to be controlled for and environmental influences [environmentality = 1-h2] to be quantified. The fundamental objective of this proposal is to identify whether exposure to chronic stress is associated with development of early risk markers of CVD and T2D and whether this differs between AAs and EAs. Collecting data on 2 additional occasions in the Georgia CV Twin study (523 pairs, 302 EA and 221 AA) who will be T9.5¿3.5 yrs old will yield 5 evaluations over a crucial time span capturing the transition from childhood into adulthood. Particularly informative will be addition of new indices of sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation (i.e., urinary excretion rate of norepinephrine and salivary cortisol), the metabolic syndrome (i.e., blood pressure, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, waist circumference, fasting glucose and insulin), environmental stress (e.g., childhood trauma, job strain, perceived discrimination and unfairness, community social status) and a measure of vascular function (i.e., arterial stiffness). Relevance to public health: lncreased understanding of the role of environmental stress related factors and their underlying physiological mechanisms as contributors to health disparities between AAs and EAs will assist in earlier and better identification of youth and young adults at increased risk for CVD and T2D. It will also aid the development of more personalized primary prevention programs involving lifestyle interventions in which the role of chronic stress will be taken into account to prevent early onset of these diseases.           ",Sociodemographic Regulation of CV Function and Structure,7413415,R01HL056622,"['Play ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Exposure to ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Health ', ' Condition ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Rest ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Development ', ' Sodium ', ' Na element ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Stress ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Sympathetic Nervous System ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' United States ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Event ', ' Salivary ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Left Ventricular Mass ', ' LV Mass ', ' waist circumference ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' American ', ' diabetes mellitus genetics ', ' diabetes genetics ', ' experience ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalmus-pituitary-adrenal axis ', ' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' lipoprotein triglyceride ', ' Structure ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Prevention program ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Social status ', ' Appearance ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' social ', ' abuse neglect ', ' neglect and abuse ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Early identification ', ' Regulation ', ' Essential Hypertension ', ' primary hypertension ', ' idiopathic hypertension ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Mediating ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' chronic disease/disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' Communities ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' pediatric trauma ', ' childhood trauma ', ' adolescent trauma ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' Prevalence ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Heritability ', ' Affective ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Etiology ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Employment ', ' biological adaptation to stress ', ' stress', ' reaction ', ' stress response ', ' reaction', ' crisis ', ' stress management ', ' stress buffering ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Regulatory Pathway ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Rate ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' urinary ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' Family ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' allostatic load ', ' USA Georgia ', ' Western Asia Georgia ', ' Georgian SSR ', ' Georgian S.S.R.

"CULTURAL FACTORS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK IN MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial research indicates that Mexican Americans are excessively vulnerable to the metabolic syndrome, with recent studies reporting metabolic syndrome prevalence rates of 30% or higher in this population. Because of the modifiable nature of the underlying causes of the metabolic syndrome and its strong association with cardiovascular disease (CVD), a better understanding of why Mexican Americans are predisposed to this condition is essential in any attempt to eliminate current CVD risk disparities in this population. The long-term goal of this research proposal is to contribute to the literature on CVD disparities in this at-risk population and to assist in the effort to eliminate such disparities. Toward this goal, the proposed research will examine the degree to which culturally-relevant variables represent risk and resilient factors for the metabolic syndrome. First, exploratory analyses will be conducted to examine: a) the nature and distributions of cultural characteristics considered potentially relevant to disease risk and resilience, including acculturation, familism, fatalism, and religiosity, and their co-variation and associations with sociodemographic characteristics; b) the relationship between cultural characteristics and behavioral risk factors relevant to the metabolic syndrome (i.e., dietary factors; physical activity); c) the relationship between cultural characteristics and metabolic syndrome indicators; and d) whether behavioral factors help explain   (i.e., ""mediate"") the relationship between cultural characteristics and metabolic syndrome variables. The training goals and research aims of the proposed plan will be accomplished in the context of two studies. The first study will examine archival data from a pilot project (South San Diego Women's Health Study; PI: L.C. Gallo; N=146) that served as the foundation for a study of the role of stress, psychosocial resources, and emotional factors in SES and ethnic CVD disparities in middle aged Mexican American women (Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways; PI: L. C. Gallo; N = 200). The second study will be used to conduct a comprehensive examination of the proposed cultural framework. A more inclusive understanding of the relevance of acculturation and Mexican cultural characteristics can help preserve any potential resiliency that exists and/or contribute to culturally sensitive approaches to risk prevention and intervention in this population.                   ",CULTURAL FACTORS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK IN MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN,7435354,F31HL087732,"['Cultural Characteristics ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Rate ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' Literature ', ' Mexican ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Condition ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Training Activity ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Woman ', ' waist circumference ', ' Behavior ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' resilience ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' emotional factor ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2008,28561,0.092179239808787
"Reducing Total Cardiovascular Risk in an Urban Community The proposed study is based on the premise that a community based participatory research partnership model using a team of an advanced practice nurse case manager, community health worker (CHW), and physician can be translated into urban community clinics and improve the quality of care and reduce disparities in cardiovascular health in minority and other underserved populations. Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of CVD risk-reducing practices remains poor. In spite of the known benefit of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dl in persons with existing heart disease, as many as 50-70% of eligible CVD patients are not placed on lipid-lowering therapy by their providers and from 20-80% of patients do not achieve the goals of therapy. The benefits of controlling high blood pressure (HBP) are well established yet national rates of HBP control remain at only 3 1% despite decades of provider and patient education. In addition, it is well established that control of glycemia, hyperlipidemia, and blood pressure reduce the risk of vascular complications in people with diabetes, 75% of whom die from some form of heart or blood vessel disease. This randomized trial will compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive intensive intervention (Cl) with a less intensive intervention (LI) in African American (AA), and White low income patients with known excessive CVD risk. A total of 500 eligible patients with CVD or type 2 diabetes (250 AA and 250 White) will be randomly selected from two urban federally-funded community clinics and randomly assigned to receive either 1) a Cl delivered by a nurse practitioner, a CHW, and the patient's physician, focusing on behavioral interventions to affect therapeutic lifestyle changes and medication adherence as well as the prescription and titration of medications or 2) a LI intervention providing feedback on CVD risk factors and guidelines to patients and their physicians. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, one and two years. It is hypothesized that a higher proportion of patients in the Cl group will achieve the treatment goals for lipid, blood pressure, and diabetes management, lifestyle behaviors and utilization of antiplatelet agent, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor therapies and that the Cl intervention wilj be cost-effective. Secondary outcomes include assessment of the impact of the Cl model on patients' satisfaction with care and health care utilization. The proposed increase in the percentage of high-risk women and men who receive recommended secondary prevention therapies and achieve goal levels could potentially result in a marked decrement in annual CVD mortality and health disparities if applied within primary care settings to populations with the characteristics of the target groups for this study.

"The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significant disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, prevalence, and health outcomes persist among racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Although Healthy People 2010 (HP) and national clinical guidelines endorse lifestyle change for preventing and reducing CVD prevalence, numerous barriers limit health behavior change in many minority and low-income communities. New risk reduction strategies are needed using community-based participatory research (CBPR) techniques, which allow researchers and communities to combine their efforts promoting health, preventing disease, and reducing health disparities. Collaborative strategies must move beyond investigating behavior change alone and begin focusing on behavior change maintenance. The GoodNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness and Spiritual Growth) Trial is an 18-month effectiveness trial with an 18-month extended maintenance study, among 20 African-American and low- income congregations participating in the GoodNEWS faith-based lay health promotion program. After training, congregations will be randomized to either GoodNEWS with a health maintenance intervention (GoodNEWS-l) or GoodNEWS program alone (GoodNEWS-PA). The maintenance intervention combines elements of the medical care model and features of community-based support. Primary data collection will occur at baseline, 18, and 36 months with the two primary outcomes being levels of physical activity as measured by 7- Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) and dietary change as measured by the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). The primary hypothesis is that the maintenance group will significantly increase physical activity and healthy eating behavior compared to the program only group. We also hypothesize that lipoprotein and glucose levels, and blood pressure will be significantly improved over baseline in the GoodNEWS-l group and that these changes will be significantly greater than in the GoodNEWS-PA group. At the end of the trial, both groups will continue in an 18-month extended maintenance study. Relevance to Public Health: The GoodNEWS Trial is consistent with the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities. Lifestyle change is an important strategy for reducing CVD prevalence in high- risk populations. The proposed study will contribute to greater understanding of community-based health promotion and primary prevention strategies for reducing risk factors for heart disease and stroke in these populations, and maintaining lifestyle and behavior change over time.             ","The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth)

"Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) populations show disproportionate rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, and eliminating these disparities is a priority objective of Healthy People 2010. Previous research suggests that in addition to many other variables, psychosocial factors may contribute to CVD disparities. The proposed research will use the Reserve Capacity Model (Gallo and Matthews, 2003) as a conceptual framework through which to examine the roles of stress, psychosocial resources, and emotional factors in SES and ethnic CVD disparities, in a community-based random sample of middle-aged, Mexican-American and non-Latino White women with relatively low and high SES (N=300). The Reserve Capacity Model posits that individuals with lower social status (low SES, minority ethnicity) may suffer negative emotional and physical health consequences due to stress experienced across multiple domains. Stress may exert direct effects on behavioral and physiological risk processes, or it may influence emotional variables which are themselves putative CVD risk factors. In addition, persons with low social status may maintain a smaller bank of resilient psychosocial resources with which to manage stress, making them especially vulnerable to concomitant physical and emotional wear and tear. The effects of low SES may be amplified in Latino women (i.e., synergistic effects). However, Mexican-American women could also benefit from resilient, socio-cultural resources that protect them, to some extent, from stress. In the current study, women will undergo a comprehensive assessment of SES, psychosocial factors, physiological and behavioral risk factors, and CVD biomarkers, and will participate in a two-day evaluation of ambulatory blood pressure and psychosocial experiences assessed via ecological momentary assessment. By examining potentially modifiable psychosocial variables as a pathway underlying CVD disparities, this study seeks to inform efforts to understand and eliminate health disparities.           ",Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways,7433221,R01HL081604,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Social Network ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Rate ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' allostatic load ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hostility ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' optimism ', ' postiive attitude ', ' Lipids ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Metabolic ', ' Daily ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' self esteem ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' day ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' psychosocial ', ' Biological Markers ', ' Biologic Marker ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' experience ', ' cysteine rich protein ', ' Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ', ' ICAM-1 ', ' Glycoprotein ICAM 1 (human clone pHRVr1 deblocked protein moiety reduced) ', ' CD54 Antigens ', ' CD54 (ICAM 1) ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Social status ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stress ', ' Communities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' emotional factor ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2008,610172,0.08544414547675676
"Cardiovascular Disease and Diabetic Nephropathy DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Hispanics are the largest ethnic minority group in the country and MA constitute almost 80% of Hispanics in California.  MA have a high prevalence of type 2 diabetes and a higher risk for diabetic nephropathy (DN).  Paradoxically, data including our own suggest that CVD burden may be lower in MA than non-Hispanic Whites (NHW).  We seek to define the CVD burden (coronary artery calcification, CAC) and its determinants in a high-risk sub-group of non-dialyzed diabetics with DN (125 MA, 125 NHW), in order to test three hypotheses:  1) Among individuals with DN, the CAC scores in MA are lower and progress more slowly, than among NHW; 2) The socioeconomic status (SES) of MA individuals with DN is significantly lower than of NHW; and 3) Among individuals with DN, MA have a lower all-cause and CVD mortality.  Ten routinely measured, two additional CVD risk factors (homocysteine, leptin) and three SES variables, pre-specified for primary analyses, will be ascertained at baseline, 12 and 24 months.  CAC will be ascertained by electron beam computerized tomography at baseline and 24 months.  The relationship of CVD risk factors and SES variables that vary by ethnicity will be tested for their contribution to ethnic differences in CAC.  The entire cohort will be followed from enrollment till the end of the grant period to ascertain ethnic differences in all-cause and CVD mortality; a high event rate in this population provides power to test the hypotheses thus proposed.  A rigorous plan for complete follow-up is proposed.  Thus, this study will define for the first time the comparative atherosclerotic burden in MA and NHW with DN and the potential role of several CVD risk factors.  It will test the novel hypothesis that despite medical and SES factors that might increase the risk for CVD mortality in MA, the opposite may be true.  Identifying health-care disparities will permit us to design targeted interventions to improve the health of ethnic minorities.

"Disparities in CHD in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This K01 award will allow the candidate, Dr. Mario Sims, to gain the skills, knowledge and experience required to become an independent investigator in health disparities research. Using data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Dr. Sims will examine the extent to which neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and key psychosocial factors (discrimination, stress, and social support) impact coronary heart disease (CHD) in African Americans in Mississippi. The JHS is the largest epidemiologic, population-based study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among African Americans, and one of its primary aims - to develop young talented minority investigators in the field of CVD research - will be accomplished through this KO1 award. CHD is the leading cause of CVD mortality in America, and Mississippi has the highest overall CVD mortality rate in the nation. Moreover, the cardiovascular health disparity between African Americans and whites is widening. Mississippi's CHD mortality rate is higher than the U.S. rate. African Americans have higher CHD prevalence and mortality rates than whites, and they also have a higher prevalence of risk factors associated with CHD such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity which clearly might influence the higher prevalence of CHD mortality. To achieve his research and career development goals, Dr. Sims will follow a career development plan at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, designed to provide knowledge, skills, and experience in 6 core competencies required to be a successful independent investigator in health disparities research: 1) research excellence in the area of CHD disparities, 2) advanced statistics and study design, 3) research ethics, 4) leadership and management, 5) presentation and teaching, and 6) scientific writing. This will be accomplished through implementation of an individualized learning plan that includes: 1) academic coursework to develop cardiovascular disease disparity research skills; 2) mentorship and consultation with nationally and internationally recognized experts in cardiovascular disease epidemiology and health disparities research; 3) mentorship by faculty sensitive to the unique needs and issues facing minority academic faculty; and 4) innovative research using a multi-dimensional framework for examining how CHD prevalence among African Americans is influence by neighborhood environments, perceived discrimination, stress, and social support. The proposed mentored research has three specific aims: 1) to examine the extent to which neighborhood SES is associated with CHD among African Americans; 2) to determine the degree to which perceived racial discrimination, stress and social support are associated with CHD among African Americans; and 3) to analyze the extent to which the association of neighborhood SES and CHD is mediated by psychosocial factors among African Americans. This is the first study of its kind to examine multiple pathways by which neighborhood SES and key psychosocial factors impact CHD risk in African Americans in Mississippi, a state with the highest CHD rate in the nation. This research will enable health-care providers to adequately serve their patients with CHD knowing that where they live and their exposure to discrimination, stress, and a lack of social support are sequelae to CHD. This research will also show which factors health policy makers need to focus on in order to address and eliminate CHD disparities.

"GENE/DIET EFFECTS ON PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the US and their risks are determined by non-modifiable (i.e., genetic) and modifiable factors (i.e., plasma lipid levels). It is well established that low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased CVD risk. A key determinant of HDL metabolism is hepatic lipase (HL), an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in lipoproteins. Within the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene at position -514 exists a common C/T polymorphism. The -514TT genotype is associated with an approximate 40% decrease in HL activity and increased HDL-C levels. However, this effect is variable among populations, suggesting gene- environment interactions. One of this grant's earlier key findings is that the -514 polymorphism shows a statistically significant interaction between HDL-C levels and dietary fat intake in Whites. Moreover, we replicated the findings in an Asian population. What remains to be demonstrated is whether these interactions occur when subjects modify their dietary fat intake and if so, what mechanisms are involved. Thus, the primary goal of this proposal is to use an interventional setting to thoroughly evaluate interactions between LIPC gene variants, changes in dietary fat intake and plasma lipid levels, inflammation markers and endothelial function. Moreover, we hypothesize that minorities, such as Hispanics, due to the enrichment of the -514 T allele (approximately 0.36) are more susceptible to the effects of these gene-diet interactions. Hence, we propose a randomized, cross over, two-phase diet intervention aimed at assessing the impact of consuming different levels of dietary fat (15% and 37%, respectively, 6 weeks each) on plasma HDL related measures in Caribbean Hispanic subjects (n=80; 40 CC and 40 TT). Our main hypothesis is that CC subjects respond to increases in the % of energy consumed as fat with increases in HDL-C levels. Conversely, in TT subjects, such dietary change results in decreases in HDL-C levels and worsening of endothelial function. Therefore, T subjects will have an elevated CVD risk when consuming high fat diets. Moreover, given the high frequency of the T allele in Hispanics, this interaction could account for some of the increase in CVD risk seen after acculturation. This evidence-based knowledge will contribute to a rational approach toward more effective dietary recommendations aimed to decrease health disparities and to a better CVD prevention.

"The Emory-Morehouse Partnership to Reduce CV Disparities    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Over the past decade, there has been an explosive increase in obesity among all age groups within the US population.  This epidemic is particularly problematic among African-Americans in the Southeast. Although genetic factors play a contributory role, it is postulated that ethnic disparities in obesity and obesity-related cardiovascular disease (CVD) is related to a dynamic interplay between biological factors and the behavioral response to the unique environmental context within ethnic communities. Obesity is often associated with perturbations in the metabolic and physiologic milieu.  A cluster of obesity-related abnormalities has been defined as the ""Metabolic Syndrome"".  The CVD complications of obesity appears to be related to the capacity for adipose tissue itself to generate ""adipokines"" that   directly predispose to insulin-resistance, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and vascular disease. The proposed program will use state-of-the-art approaches to define potential ethnic differences in the profile of metabolic, physiologic and biochemical features associated with obesity as well as the salutary responses to lifestyle modification.  The proposed program uses a multi-disciplinary strategy to systematically characterize potential ethnic differences in obesity-related CVD by drawing upon the fields of psychology, physiology, biochemistry, nursing and clinical medicine.  In a thematic series of inter-related studies, our Program's research plan ranges from:  epidemiology studies within the ethnic communities, to patient-centered clinical trial interventions within ethnic community practices, tothe analysis of novel biomarkers of human pathobiology.  This collaborative multi-investigator team is built upon a complementary partnership between the Morehouse School of Medicine and Emory University.  This partnership shares a joint commitment to address the striking ethnic disparities in the high-risk CVD population that we serve.  The specific aims are:  Aim 1:  Define the relative influence of psychosocial/cultural factors and biological mediators as determinants of ethnic disparities in obesity and the metabolic syndrome in a population-based bi-racial cohort.  Aim 2:  Define the effectiveness of patient-targeted behavioral interventions to enhance the health of African-American patients with the   Metabolic Syndrome in the context of community-based clinical practices.  Aim 3:  To assess the impact of innovative lifestyle intervention strategies on conventional and novel biomarkers of vascular disease risk in African-Americans.  Aim 4:  To enhance the education/training of fellows/practitioners engaged in CVD disparities research/practice and promote partnerships that enhance cardiovascular health within ethnic communities.

"Subclinical CVD in African American Type 2 Diabetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term objective of the African American-Diabetes Heart Study is to identify the causes of the markedly lower amounts of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in African American (AA) subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), relative to European Americans (EA). Additional goals are to evaluate the impacts of lifestyle, environment and inherited factors on the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to identify genomic regions contributing to the inherited component of subclinical CVD in AAs with T2DM. These goals will be achieved by the concerted efforts of clinicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, biochemists, and molecular geneticists, building on work that was previously performed in the parent Diabetes Heart Study (DHS). Specifically, we will ascertain, phenotype, and collect DMA from an additional 566 unrelated AAs with T2DM, combining their information with 90 unrelated AA diabetic subjects previously recruited into the DHS (656 subjects total). Clinical risk factor profiles will be created for each participant and we will assess subclinical and clinical CVD using Multi-Detector Row Computed Tomography of the coronary and carotid arteries and infra-renal aorta. We will next examine the impact of conventional CVD risk factors (smoking, lipids and lipoproteins, hypertension and glycemic control) and novel risk factors (sex hormones and other endocrine measures, calcium regulating hormones, calcification inhibitors and inflammatory biomarkers) on the development of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in AAs with T2DM. We will investigate ethnic differences in calcified atheromatous plaque by comparing the above results with those obtained in a matched cohort of EA subjects with T2DM from the parent DHS. In years 4 and 5, we will screen the genome using Mapping by Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium (MALD) in an expanded sample of 1,100 unrelated AA subjects with T2DM (444 previously recruited in existing studies and 656 locally recruited) to locate genomic regions that harbor calcified atherosclerotic plaque susceptibility genes in the diabetic AA population. These strategies will provide novel information on causes of the marked ethnic disparity in subclinical CVD, will assist in identifying genes that predispose to CVD in AA subjects with T2DM, and may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies to prevent hardening of the arteries.              ",Subclinical CVD in African American Type 2 Diabetics,7487044,R01DK071891,"['Environmental

"Relationship of Blood Esterases, Pesticide Exposure and Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for an R21 grant is designed to solidify an interdisciplinary team of basic and clinical researchers in the Center for Environmental Health Sciences at Mississippi State University for research into the environmental factors contributing to the higher mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Deep South and among African Americans, and to position this team for participation in larger-scale on- going multi-institutional epidemiological studies. This health disparity in CVD is logically related to risk factors more prevalent in the South (which has a higher proportion of African Americans than other regions in the country.) The South is rural and highly agricultural, so the Southern populations would be expected to be routinely exposed to higher levels of pesticides than populations in many other regions. We hypothesize the following: The effects of pesticide exposure contribute to the development of CVD and are more pronounced in the African American population. Two enzymes that we have studied for many years because of their involvement in the detoxication of many pesticides are paraoxonase (PON1) and carboxylesterase (CaE). The former is known to be associated with HDL particles and the latter has recently been identified as a cholesteryl ester hydrolase that is involved in reverse cholesterol transport; therefore, both of these enzymes are involved in vascular health, and are potential biomarkers of susceptibility to CVD. We have experience biomonitoring urinary pesticide metabolites as an index of current pesticide exposure. We have developed a novel geospatial analysis of pesticide harvested crop records that predicts pesticide exposure to individuals for the previous 35 years of their lives. We have experience in cardiology and access to patients in a cardiology practice. We propose a pilot study to investigate the above listed parameters (i.e., PON1 and CaE in the blood and pesticide metabolites in the urine) of subjects recruited from the cardiology practice, and to calculate strength of associations among these factors, the degree of cardiovascular disease and the pesticide exposure estimated in the geospatial analysis model. This pilot study will be conducted following a year of planning, solidifying the interdisciplinary team, optimizing assays, and developing interactions with the project's consultants. The pilot study will position us to participate in a far more extensive study through interactions with our consultants at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In addition, we anticipate that we will develop more simplified assay methods for PON1 and CaE that will be more amenable for use as a clinical biomarker.              ","Relationship of Blood

"Healthy Bodies, Healthy Hearts after Menopause    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Margaret (Molly) B. Conroy is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. She is applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) in order to become an independent clinical investigator. Her proposal focuses on the relationships between physical activity, abdominal and muscular adiposity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women after menopause. Women are a high-risk population, as they are more likely to be physically inactive than men, a disparity that becomes more striking with advancing age. Following menopause, the incidence of CVD in women increases, while participation in regular physical activity declines. Further investigation is warranted of the pathways through which physical activity impacts CVD risk after menopause, particularly those incorporating body composition and potentially modifiable psychosocial factors. Dr. Conroy will examine these relationships and implement and evaluate a physical activity intervention in a clinical setting by pursuing three specific aims. Aim #1 will determine whether abdominal and muscular adiposity mediate the relationship between physical activity and subclinical cardiovascular disease risk in a cohort of postmenopausal women. Aim #2 will examine the relationships between changes in physical activity, abdominal and muscular adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk after an intensive lifestyle intervention. Aim #3 will involve a randomized, controlled physical activity intervention for early postmenopausal women that adapts clinical trial methods and translates them to the primary care patient population and practice setting. Aim #1 will be addressed by an ancillary study in the Women on the Move through Activity and Nutrition (WOMAN) cohort. Aim #2 will be addressed in the Slow Adverse Vascular Effects (SAVE) study. Aim #3 wiN be addressed by recruiting an intervention cohort from Dr. Conroy's primary care clinic. Experts in the fields of physical activity and CVD epidemiology, translational research, behavioral medicine and intervention design will supervise Dr. Conroy's career development. She will receive specific training in (1) collection, analysis and interpretation of state-of-the art outcome measures of obesity and subclinical cardiovascular disease; (2) theoretical background and hands-on skills necessary for planning and executing physical activity and lifestyle interventions; and (3) translational research, focused on strategies, collaborative models and technical support systems for implementing lifestyle interventions in clinical systems. A better understanding of the mechanisms linking physical activity, adiposity and CVD after menopause and innovative physical activity promotion strategies in this high-risk population are critical steps towards advancing cardiovascular health in women.

"Heart Failure Disparities in Native Hawaiians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem leading to considerable cardiovascular morbidity &  mortality.  The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.  To address HF disparities among NHs and PPs, a partnership program, the HF Disparities Program (HFD), will be established between the Queen Emma Clinic (QEC) and the Department of NH Health.

"Heart Failure Disparities in Native Hawaiians    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem leading to considerable cardiovascular morbidity &  mortality.  The impact of HF on minority populations, such as Native Hawaiians (NHs) & other Pacific Peoples (PPs), is unknown.  NHs are known to have high rates of risk factors for HF & one of the highest rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the U.S.  Access to appropriate care is known to improve health outcomes for HF patients, but access to specialist care presents a major barrier for NHs & PPs because they tend to reside in medically underserved areas.

"Sociodemographic Regulation of CV Function and Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and their comorbidity pose important health challenges for the United States in the coming decades. African Americans (AAs) have a greater prevalence of T2D and have higher CVD and T2D related mortality rates compared with European Americans (EAs). Environmental stress has been postulated as playing an important role in the development of CVD and T2D, particularly among AAs, but little is known about underlying physiological mechanisms linking stress to early etiology of CVD and T2D. Assessment of possible differential impact of chronic environmental stress upon longitudinal development and manifestation of preclinical markers of CVD and T2D in AAs and EAs can be accomplished only with proper control for genetic influences. Employment of a genetically and environmentally informative twin study design enables genetic variation contributing to individual variation [heritability (h2)] to be controlled for and environmental influences [environmentality = 1-h2] to be quantified. The fundamental objective of this proposal is to identify whether exposure to chronic stress is associated with development of early risk markers of CVD and T2D and whether this differs between AAs and EAs. Collecting data on 2 additional occasions in the Georgia CV Twin study (523 pairs, 302 EA and 221 AA) who will be T9.5¿3.5 yrs old will yield 5 evaluations over a crucial time span capturing the transition from childhood into adulthood. Particularly informative will be addition of new indices of sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation (i.e., urinary excretion rate of norepinephrine and salivary cortisol), the metabolic syndrome (i.e., blood pressure, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, waist circumference, fasting glucose and insulin), environmental stress (e.g., childhood trauma, job strain, perceived discrimination and unfairness, community social status) and a measure of vascular function (i.e., arterial stiffness). Relevance to public health: lncreased understanding of the role of environmental stress related factors and their underlying physiological mechanisms as contributors to health disparities between AAs and EAs will assist in earlier and better identification of youth and young adults at increased risk for CVD and T2D. It will also aid the development of more personalized primary prevention programs involving lifestyle interventions in which the role of chronic stress will be taken into account to prevent early onset of these diseases.           ",Sociodemographic Regulation of CV Function and Structure,7587401,R01HL056622,"['sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', '

"Healthy Bodies, Healthy Hearts after Menopause    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Margaret (Molly) B. Conroy is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. She is applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) in order to become an independent clinical investigator. Her proposal focuses on the relationships between physical activity, abdominal and muscular adiposity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women after menopause. Women are a high-risk population, as they are more likely to be physically inactive than men, a disparity that becomes more striking with advancing age. Following menopause, the incidence of CVD in women increases, while participation in regular physical activity declines. Further investigation is warranted of the pathways through which physical activity impacts CVD risk after menopause, particularly those incorporating body composition and potentially modifiable psychosocial factors. Dr. Conroy will examine these relationships and implement and evaluate a physical activity intervention in a clinical setting by pursuing three specific aims. Aim #1 will determine whether abdominal and muscular adiposity mediate the relationship between physical activity and subclinical cardiovascular disease risk in a cohort of postmenopausal women. Aim #2 will examine the relationships between changes in physical activity, abdominal and muscular adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk after an intensive lifestyle intervention. Aim #3 will involve a randomized, controlled physical activity intervention for early postmenopausal women that adapts clinical trial methods and translates them to the primary care patient population and practice setting. Aim #1 will be addressed by an ancillary study in the Women on the Move through Activity and Nutrition (WOMAN) cohort. Aim #2 will be addressed in the Slow Adverse Vascular Effects (SAVE) study. Aim #3 wiN be addressed by recruiting an intervention cohort from Dr. Conroy's primary care clinic. Experts in the fields of physical activity and CVD epidemiology, translational research, behavioral medicine and intervention design will supervise Dr. Conroy's career development. She will receive specific training in (1) collection, analysis and interpretation of state-of-the art outcome measures of obesity and subclinical cardiovascular disease; (2) theoretical background and hands-on skills necessary for planning and executing physical activity and lifestyle interventions; and (3) translational research, focused on strategies, collaborative models and technical support systems for implementing lifestyle interventions in clinical systems. A better understanding of the mechanisms linking physical activity, adiposity and CVD after menopause and innovative physical activity promotion strategies in this high-risk population are critical steps towards advancing cardiovascular health in women.

"The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significant disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, prevalence, and health outcomes persist among racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Although Healthy People 2010 (HP) and national clinical guidelines endorse lifestyle change for preventing and reducing CVD prevalence, numerous barriers limit health behavior change in many minority and low-income communities. New risk reduction strategies are needed using community-based participatory research (CBPR) techniques, which allow researchers and communities to combine their efforts promoting health, preventing disease, and reducing health disparities. Collaborative strategies must move beyond investigating behavior change alone and begin focusing on behavior change maintenance. The GoodNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness and Spiritual Growth) Trial is an 18-month effectiveness trial with an 18-month extended maintenance study, among 20 African-American and low- income congregations participating in the GoodNEWS faith-based lay health promotion program. After training, congregations will be randomized to either GoodNEWS with a health maintenance intervention (GoodNEWS-l) or GoodNEWS program alone (GoodNEWS-PA). The maintenance intervention combines elements of the medical care model and features of community-based support. Primary data collection will occur at baseline, 18, and 36 months with the two primary outcomes being levels of physical activity as measured by 7- Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) and dietary change as measured by the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). The primary hypothesis is that the maintenance group will significantly increase physical activity and healthy eating behavior compared to the program only group. We also hypothesize that lipoprotein and glucose levels, and blood pressure will be significantly improved over baseline in the GoodNEWS-l group and that these changes will be significantly greater than in the GoodNEWS-PA group. At the end of the trial, both groups will continue in an 18-month extended maintenance study. Relevance to Public Health: The GoodNEWS Trial is consistent with the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities. Lifestyle change is an important strategy for reducing CVD prevalence in high- risk populations. The proposed study will contribute to greater understanding of community-based health promotion and primary prevention strategies for reducing risk factors for heart disease and stroke in these populations, and maintaining lifestyle and behavior change over time.

"Relationship of Blood Esterases, Pesticide Exposure and Cardiovascular Disease    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application for an R21 grant is designed to solidify an interdisciplinary team of basic and clinical researchers in the Center for Environmental Health Sciences at Mississippi State University for research into the environmental factors contributing to the higher mortality of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the Deep South and among African Americans, and to position this team for participation in larger-scale on- going multi-institutional epidemiological studies. This health disparity in CVD is logically related to risk factors more prevalent in the South (which has a higher proportion of African Americans than other regions in the country.) The South is rural and highly agricultural, so the Southern populations would be expected to be routinely exposed to higher levels of pesticides than populations in many other regions. We hypothesize the following: The effects of pesticide exposure contribute to the development of CVD and are more pronounced in the African American population. Two enzymes that we have studied for many years because of their involvement in the detoxication of many pesticides are paraoxonase (PON1) and carboxylesterase (CaE). The former is known to be associated with HDL particles and the latter has recently been identified as a cholesteryl ester hydrolase that is involved in reverse cholesterol transport; therefore, both of these enzymes are involved in vascular health, and are potential biomarkers of susceptibility to CVD. We have experience biomonitoring urinary pesticide metabolites as an index of current pesticide exposure. We have developed a novel geospatial analysis of pesticide harvested crop records that predicts pesticide exposure to individuals for the previous 35 years of their lives. We have experience in cardiology and access to patients in a cardiology practice. We propose a pilot study to investigate the above listed parameters (i.e., PON1 and CaE in the blood and pesticide metabolites in the urine) of subjects recruited from the cardiology practice, and to calculate strength of associations among these factors, the degree of cardiovascular disease and the pesticide exposure estimated in the geospatial analysis model. This pilot study will be conducted following a year of planning, solidifying the interdisciplinary team, optimizing assays, and developing interactions with the project's consultants. The pilot study will position us to participate in a far more extensive study through interactions with our consultants at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In addition, we anticipate that we will develop more simplified assay methods for PON1 and CaE that will be more amenable for use as a clinical biomarker.

"The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significant disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, prevalence, and health outcomes persist among racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Although Healthy People 2010 (HP) and national clinical guidelines endorse lifestyle change for preventing and reducing CVD prevalence, numerous barriers limit health behavior change in many minority and low-income communities. New risk reduction strategies are needed using community-based participatory research (CBPR) techniques, which allow researchers and communities to combine their efforts promoting health, preventing disease, and reducing health disparities. Collaborative strategies must move beyond investigating behavior change alone and begin focusing on behavior change maintenance. The GoodNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness and Spiritual Growth) Trial is an 18-month effectiveness trial with an 18-month extended maintenance study, among 20 African-American and low- income congregations participating in the GoodNEWS faith-based lay health promotion program. After training, congregations will be randomized to either GoodNEWS with a health maintenance intervention (GoodNEWS-l) or GoodNEWS program alone (GoodNEWS-PA). The maintenance intervention combines elements of the medical care model and features of community-based support. Primary data collection will occur at baseline, 18, and 36 months with the two primary outcomes being levels of physical activity as measured by 7- Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) and dietary change as measured by the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). The primary hypothesis is that the maintenance group will significantly increase physical activity and healthy eating behavior compared to the program only group. We also hypothesize that lipoprotein and glucose levels, and blood pressure will be significantly improved over baseline in the GoodNEWS-l group and that these changes will be significantly greater than in the GoodNEWS-PA group. At the end of the trial, both groups will continue in an 18-month extended maintenance study. Relevance to Public Health: The GoodNEWS Trial is consistent with the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities. Lifestyle change is an important strategy for reducing CVD prevalence in high- risk populations. The proposed study will contribute to greater understanding of community-based health promotion and primary prevention strategies for reducing risk factors for heart disease and stroke in these populations, and maintaining lifestyle and behavior change over time.             ","The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial",7629668,R01HL087768,"['Disease

"The Nutrigenomics of Vitamin D Metabolism in African-Americans    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although there has been an overall decline in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality over the past halfcentury, racial/ethnic minorities continue to suffer a disproportionate burden of lives lost. This increased burden of CVD mortality involves social, behavioral and genetic factors that predispose to CVD risk factors such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension. Recent studies have implicated deficiencies in Vitamin D (Vit-D) in the pathogenesis of a variety of disorders including cancer, diabetes and hypertension. Indeed, Vit-D insufficiency affects nearly 50% of the US population and 80% of African-Americans. A growing body of evidence suggests that the increased susceptibility to Vit-D deficiency among African-Americans reflects the interplay between environmental, social, behavioral and genetic factors. Unfortunately, the field has lacked an integrated, multi-level model that systematically characterizes the genetic-behavioral-social interactions that influence Vit-D metabolism and contribute to hypovitaminosis in African-Americans. Moreover, it remains unclear whether clinical interventions that normalize Vit-D homeostasis in African-Americans will ameliorate health disparity conditions such as hypertension and CVD. Our multi-disciplinary team will take a multi-level approach to address this challenging and important problem. Our working model hypothesizes that nutrient-genetic interactions that have transpired during the population history of individuals of African ancestry have resulted in a distinctive set of alleles that modify the response to sun exposure, the regulation of Vit-D metabolism and the nutrigenomic responses to Vit-D. Moreover, these intrinsic biological pathways are further modified by the influence of behavioral factors and the unique social-environmental conditions experienced by African-Americans. We will assess these multilevel interactions by pursuing the following specific aims: Aim I: To characterize the interactions between genetic, behavioral, social and environmental factors on dietary Vit-D intake and sun exposure as determinants of Vit-D levels in African- Americans. Aim II: To characterize the gene-environment interactions that influence the nutrigenomic response to Vit-D supplementation on the Vit-D-Parathyroid Hormone level relationship in African-Americans. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Due to dietary habits and other factors, most Americans are relatively deficient in Vitamin D. Recent evidence suggests that Vitamin D deficiency may predispose to cancer, diabetes and heart disease. African-Americans are particularly vulnerable to this condition. The proposed project will address the causes of this health disparity and refine the therapeutic strategy for correcting this major public health problem.                ",The Nutrigenomics of Vitamin D Metabolism in African-Americans,7624781,U54RR022762,[''],NCRR,CHARLES R.

"Lifecourse SES and Cardiovascular Disease Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will take advantage of data that were collected as a part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA), a longitudinal investigation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in an adult community sample, to examine potential explanations for socioeconomic disparities in CVD. A major focus is to understand how changes in socioeconomic status (SES) over the lifecourse influence future CVD risk, and the extent to which the association between SES change and CVD risk is moderated by race/ethnicity and gender. Specifically, emphasis is placed on the possibility that psychosocial factors related to SES may influence future subclinical atherosclerotic burden by modulating processes thought to be related to CVD pathogenesis (blood pressure [BP] and chronic low grade inflammation and oxidative stress) via regulation of adrenal hormone activity. Emphasis also is placed on the possibility that changes in SES over the lifecourse may be paralleled by changes in health behaviors and that   the evolution of health behaviors over time might explain the association of SES with CVD risk factors. We take two different approaches to the analysis of lifecourse SES: we examine (a) trajectories of change in SES during young and middle adulthood; and (b) a total lifecourse model that incorporates measures of childhood SES. We also examine whether perceived social standing is associated with CVD risk factors, and whether this association explains the link between objective SES and CVD risk.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will make a unique contribution to the study of SES disparities in CVD risk by employing a lifecourse approach that incorporates (a) analysis of change in SES trajectories across young and middle adulthood, (b) measures of childhood as well as adult SES, and (c) examination of whether the influence of SES factors on CVD risk differs according to race/ethnicity and gender. There are several reasons to take a lifecourse approach to the examination of SES disparities in CVD risk. First of all, being able to identify when during the lifecourse SES begins to influence CVD risk, and how the effects of early status combine with those of adult status to further influence risk will enhance our understanding of SES disparities in CVD. Second, revealing an association of lifecourse SES with subclinical atherosclerosis could have important clinical implications insofar as it would allow for identification and tracking of individuals who may be at elevated risk for clinical CVD at early points in the course of the disease that may be more responsive to early preventive treatment. Finally, revealing an association of lifecourse SES with biological and behavioral factors known to contribute to CVD pathogenesis will provide us with additional insight into mechanisms whereby relative socioeconomic disadvantage can be translated into cardiovascular pathology. Obtaining a fuller understanding of when and how socioeconomic factors influence CVD risk, and whether the nature and strength of this influence differs between Blacks and Whites and men and women, can have important implications for public health insofar as it will enable the development of targeted preventive strategies that ultimately can lessen the burden of CVD across the socioeconomic hierarchy.            Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Deverts, Denise, Janicki PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will make a unique contribution to the study of SES disparities in CVD risk by employing a lifecourse approach that incorporates (a) analysis of change in SES trajectories across young and middle adulthood, (b) measures of childhood as well as adult SES, and (c) examination of whether the influence of SES factors on CVD risk differs according to race/ethnicity and gender.

"Northern Manhattan Healthy Heart Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northern Manhattan Healthy Heart Initiative (NMHHI) is in response to the NHLBI's interest in interventions that address multiple risk factors for people at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and utilizes the existing framework for community based participatory research in our NIH funded Center of Excellence on Health Disparities Research. We propose to examine the effectiveness of a Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention in CVD risk reduction among Caribbean Latinos. Although CHWs programs have exited in the US for over 4 decades, numerous recent reviews continue to identify the lack of rigorous evaluation data as the primary barrier limiting the dissemination of CHW programs. Our proposal addresses specific research priority needs of our community planning council. Our community partners participated in all aspects of the proposal including conception, jointly formulating the study design, and developing and writing major sections of the study intervention. The study design is a randomized controlled trial of 800 Latino patients aged 35-65 with hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia being cared at 7 primary care sites. The study builds on a successful diabetes CHW program previously developed by our community partners and our medical center. The Specific Aim is to determine if a community based CHW intervention results in lowering of CVD risk factors at 18 months as measured by the Total Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Additional primary outcomes include blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. Secondary objectives will determine if the CHW intervention results in improvements in the following putative mechanisms that may influence the FRS: 1) Medication adherence; 2) Improvements in diet and exercise; and 3) Self efficacy, all measured using culturally validated instruments. At study conclusion we will also examine the cost effectiveness of our intervention. Our CHW intervention uses the Chronic Care Model as an overarching framework and builds on existing programmatic strengths at each CBO. Our two community partners will have a major role in this application including primary responsibly for subject recruitment, hiring and training the CHWs, delivering the CHW intervention, and collaborating on study finding dissemination. This is reflected in the budget, half of which is to the community partners.

"Can CHW/PS Promote Lifestyle and Environment Changes to Reduce CVD Risk in Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HEART (Heath Education Assessment Research Team) Phase 2 is a community-based participatory research continuation project whose overall goal is to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Hispanics in El Paso, Texas using the community health workers/promotores de salud (CHW/PS) model. In HEART Phase 1 we: 1) developed a Community Health Advisory Committee (CHAC) to lead the participatory research process and guide additional means to obtain community input; 2) performed a community needs assessment to direct the research process; and 3) conducted a four-month CHW7PS pilot intervention (group classes and follow-up) to identify an optimal CHW/PS outreach approach. In addition to the lifestyle changes promoted in our pilot study, the HEART Phase 2 will add a fitness component and include a focus on the environment that contributes to CVD risk. Two new community partners have been added to emphasize our fitness and environmental approach: the YWCA facility in the Lower Valley and after-school programs available at both the YWCA and through the City of El Paso Parks and Recreation Department. We plan to foster the sustained integration of the CHW/PS model in these new community based organizations (CBOs) and public sector settings through increased organizational experience and knowledge regarding culturally-tailored lifestyle and environmental interventions. Most importantly, we will conduct an intervention in the Lower Valley of Et Paso that will build on our pilot study. Our culturally sensitive programming will be known as Mi Corazon, Mi Comunidad (My Heart, My Community). The goals of the intervention will be to 1) increase awareness and utilization of programs by Hispanic families living in the target community; 2) increase health behaviors including intentions and self-efficacy, and 3) decrease CVD risk factors among Hispanic families. Through our combined approach and with the continuous input from the CHAC, we will impact change agents, stakeholders, organizations, individuals and families. Lastly, we will define and promote a policy agenda that targets integration of CHW/PS in CBOs and public sector programs in conjunction with a dissemination plan to share our findings with a broader audience, thereby improving lifestyle and environmental factors that impact CVD risk factors for Hispanics in El Paso, Texas.          ",Can CHW/PS Promote Lifestyle and Environment Changes to Reduce CVD Risk in Texas,7647301,R24MD001785,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Family ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Sector ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Texas ', ' Awareness ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' outreach ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' after-school program ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' environmental change ', ' environmental intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' service utilization ', ' group intervention ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R24,2009,535276,0.12143989664171076
"GENE/DIET EFFECTS ON PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the US and their risks are determined by non-modifiable (i.e., genetic) and modifiable factors (i.e., plasma lipid levels). It is well established that low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased CVD risk. A key determinant of HDL metabolism is hepatic lipase (HL), an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in lipoproteins. Within the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene at position -514 exists a common C/T polymorphism. The -514TT genotype is associated with an approximate 40% decrease in HL activity and increased HDL-C levels. However, this effect is variable among populations, suggesting gene- environment interactions. One of this grant's earlier key findings is that the -514 polymorphism shows a statistically significant interaction between HDL-C levels and dietary fat intake in Whites. Moreover, we replicated the findings in an Asian population. What remains to be demonstrated is whether these interactions occur when subjects modify their dietary fat intake and if so, what mechanisms are involved. Thus, the primary goal of this proposal is to use an interventional setting to thoroughly evaluate interactions between LIPC gene variants, changes in dietary fat intake and plasma lipid levels, inflammation markers and endothelial function. Moreover, we hypothesize that minorities, such as Hispanics, due to the enrichment of the -514 T allele (approximately 0.36) are more susceptible to the effects of these gene-diet interactions. Hence, we propose a randomized, cross over, two-phase diet intervention aimed at assessing the impact of consuming different levels of dietary fat (15% and 37%, respectively, 6 weeks each) on plasma HDL related measures in Caribbean Hispanic subjects (n=80; 40 CC and 40 TT). Our main hypothesis is that CC subjects respond to increases in the % of energy consumed as fat with increases in HDL-C levels. Conversely, in TT subjects, such dietary change results in decreases in HDL-C levels and worsening of endothelial function. Therefore, T subjects will have an elevated CVD risk when consuming high fat diets. Moreover, given the high frequency of the T allele in Hispanics, this interaction could account for some of the increase in CVD risk seen after acculturation. This evidence-based knowledge will contribute to a rational approach toward more effective dietary recommendations aimed to decrease health disparities and to a better CVD prevention.           ",GENE/DIET EFFECTS ON PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS,7655319,R01HL054776,"['Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Chemicals ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' Lipoproteins ', ' High Density Lipoproteins ', ' alpha-Lipoproteins ', ' High density lipoprotein ', ' Heavy Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Lipoproteins ', ' HDL ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' Low-Density Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoproteins ', ' LDL Lipoproteins ', ' LDL ', ' Food Interactions ', ' nutrient interaction ', ' Lysophosphatidylcholines ', ' Lysolecithins ', ' anakinra ', ' urine-derived IL1 inhibitor ', ' urine interleukin 1 inhibitor ', ' urine IL-1 inhibitor ', ' interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein ', ' Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist ', ' IL1RN ', ' IL1 febrile inhibitor ', ' IL-1ra ', ' male ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity -

"Reducing Total Cardiovascular Risk in an Urban Community The proposed study is based on the premise that a community based participatory research partnership model using a team of an advanced practice nurse case manager, community health worker (CHW), and physician can be translated into urban community clinics and improve the quality of care and reduce disparities in cardiovascular health in minority and other underserved populations. Despite well-publicized guidelines on the appropriate management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes, implementation of CVD risk-reducing practices remains poor. In spite of the known benefit of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels below 100 mg/dl in persons with existing heart disease, as many as 50-70% of eligible CVD patients are not placed on lipid-lowering therapy by their providers and from 20-80% of patients do not achieve the goals of therapy. The benefits of controlling high blood pressure (HBP) are well established yet national rates of HBP control remain at only 3 1% despite decades of provider and patient education. In addition, it is well established that control of glycemia, hyperlipidemia, and blood pressure reduce the risk of vascular complications in people with diabetes, 75% of whom die from some form of heart or blood vessel disease. This randomized trial will compare the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a comprehensive intensive intervention (Cl) with a less intensive intervention (LI) in African American (AA), and White low income patients with known excessive CVD risk. A total of 500 eligible patients with CVD or type 2 diabetes (250 AA and 250 White) will be randomly selected from two urban federally-funded community clinics and randomly assigned to receive either 1) a Cl delivered by a nurse practitioner, a CHW, and the patient's physician, focusing on behavioral interventions to affect therapeutic lifestyle changes and medication adherence as well as the prescription and titration of medications or 2) a LI intervention providing feedback on CVD risk factors and guidelines to patients and their physicians. Outcomes will be measured at baseline, one and two years. It is hypothesized that a higher proportion of patients in the Cl group will achieve the treatment goals for lipid, blood pressure, and diabetes management, lifestyle behaviors and utilization of antiplatelet agent, beta blocker, and ACE inhibitor therapies and that the Cl intervention wilj be cost-effective. Secondary outcomes include assessment of the impact of the Cl model on patients' satisfaction with care and health care utilization. The proposed increase in the percentage of high-risk women and men who receive recommended secondary prevention therapies and achieve goal levels could potentially result in a marked decrement in annual CVD mortality and health disparities if applied within primary care settings to populations with the characteristics of the target groups for this study.

"Health Disparities and CVD: Admixture Mapping in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic risk for complex processes like CVD appears to involve interactions among multiple genes of small effect. Association mapping is much more powerful than linkage mapping in identifying such genes, but requires 200-500 times as many markers to scan the genome. Admixture mapping can extract much of the power of association studies but requires genotyping only a few thousand markers genome-wide. This application partners Jackson Heart Study (JHS) investigators with two leaders in the field of admixture mapping, Drs. David Reich and Nick Patterson. The studies proposed will exploit the genotyping and analytic power of the Broad Institute to perform admixture mapping in the largest cohort ever assembled to study CVD in African Americans. Several factors contribute to the timeliness of this study and show the strength of the proposed research team: (a) Our group has published the first practical genetic resource for admixture mapping: 2,154 markers with large frequency differences between Africans and Europeans, and methods to analyze the data. (b) We have assembled a unique cohort for the largest-ever genome-wide admixture scan for CVD risk genes: 3,796 unrelated African Americans rigorously characterized for a large number of CVD phenotypes, including HTN, coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. (c) Admixture mapping has had its first empiric successes, localizing genes for hypertension and multiple sclerosis. Admixture mapping works in practice, making it critically important to apply it to seek CVD genes in the JHS cohort. We propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Whole-genome admixture scanning for CVD related genes. We will type 3,072 admixture mapping markers in DMA of 3,796 unrelated African American participants from the JHS cohort. We will concentrate our analyses on phenotypes with known differences in prevalence between African Americans and Europeans: hypertension, serum lipid levels, left ventricular hypertrophy, and low birth weight. Specific Aim 2: Follow-up and fine-mapping of the two strongest peaks of association. We will genotype 2,535 additional SNPs/peak in 940 participants (470 at each extreme for the selected phenotype). Specific Aim 3: Acquire all recorded birth weights for JHS participants. Birth weight will be analyzed both as a covariate for CVD phenotypes and as an independent phenotype, by admixture mapping. Lav language description: Finding genes that affect the risk of disease can identify new targets for drug treatment and lead to the development of important medical tests. These studies will seek genes of African and European origin that cause heart and blood vessel diseases in African Americans.           ",Health Disparities and CVD: Admixture Mapping in the Jackson Heart Study,7637780,R01HL084107,"['Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' Disease ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Admixture ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Genome Scan ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' positional cloning ', ' reverse genetics ', ' Affect ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Age ', ' density ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Family Study ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Medical ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Institutes ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Language ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' African ', ' European ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Maps ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methods ', ' Mississippi ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Morbidity -

"Subclinical CVD in African American Type 2 Diabetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term objective of the African American-Diabetes Heart Study is to identify the causes of the markedly lower amounts of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in African American (AA) subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), relative to European Americans (EA). Additional goals are to evaluate the impacts of lifestyle, environment and inherited factors on the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to identify genomic regions contributing to the inherited component of subclinical CVD in AAs with T2DM. These goals will be achieved by the concerted efforts of clinicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, biochemists, and molecular geneticists, building on work that was previously performed in the parent Diabetes Heart Study (DHS). Specifically, we will ascertain, phenotype, and collect DMA from an additional 566 unrelated AAs with T2DM, combining their information with 90 unrelated AA diabetic subjects previously recruited into the DHS (656 subjects total). Clinical risk factor profiles will be created for each participant and we will assess subclinical and clinical CVD using Multi-Detector Row Computed Tomography of the coronary and carotid arteries and infra-renal aorta. We will next examine the impact of conventional CVD risk factors (smoking, lipids and lipoproteins, hypertension and glycemic control) and novel risk factors (sex hormones and other endocrine measures, calcium regulating hormones, calcification inhibitors and inflammatory biomarkers) on the development of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in AAs with T2DM. We will investigate ethnic differences in calcified atheromatous plaque by comparing the above results with those obtained in a matched cohort of EA subjects with T2DM from the parent DHS. In years 4 and 5, we will screen the genome using Mapping by Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium (MALD) in an expanded sample of 1,100 unrelated AA subjects with T2DM (444 previously recruited in existing studies and 656 locally recruited) to locate genomic regions that harbor calcified atherosclerotic plaque susceptibility genes in the diabetic AA population. These strategies will provide novel information on causes of the marked ethnic disparity in subclinical CVD, will assist in identifying genes that predispose to CVD in AA subjects with T2DM, and may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies to prevent hardening of the arteries.              ",Subclinical CVD in African American Type 2 Diabetics,7636852,R01DK071891,"['Vascular

"Racial Differences in Atherosclerosis, Plaque Vulnerability, and CVD Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Blacks are affected disproportionately by CVD; age-adjusted coronary heart disease death rates are 29% higher for blacks than for whites. This disparity in risk is only partially explained by racial differences in prevalences of traditional and emerging CVD risk factors. Despite having higher rates of CVD, blacks are less likely than whites to have severe obstructive coronary artery atherosclerosis and coronary artery calcium. This observation is counterintuitive; the less diffuse coronary artery calcification and obstruction observed in blacks would be expected to be associated with a lower prevalence of CVD risk factors and a lower incidence of CVD events, neither of which is observed. In the face of these inconsistencies, we hypothesize that as compared to whites, blacks are more likely to develop vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques that are associated with acute CVD. Our preliminary investigations support this hypothesis by demonstrating that black race is independently associated with less calcified coronary artery plaques, greater positive arterial remodeling, and more endothelial dysfunction. Racial differences in these arterial characteristics, which are associated with increased plaque vulnerability, may be explained by our observations which indicate that blacks have higher levels of circulating modulators of plaque vulnerability. Therefore, the goal of the proposed study is to prospectively investigate race-related differences in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaques in our extensively characterized cohort of 2,000 subjects (43% black) in our Heart SCORE study that has collected a wealth of biological data and plasma over a follow-up period of 6 years. This proposal will compare the prevalence of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque between blacks and whites who are enrolled in Heart SCORE by using microbubble contrast-enhanced B-mode ultrasonography to quantify carotid artery adventitial vasa vasorum density, which correlates with plaque vulnerability, and to accurately measure intimal-medial thickness of both the far and near walls of the carotid artery (cIMT). The proposed study will also evaluate race-related differences in distributions of modulators of plaque vulnerability, such as inflammatory mediators, matrix metalloproteinases, and markers of endothelial cell activation, and in the predictive value of these modulators for long-term risk of adverse CVD events. Moreover, the study will assess the predictive values of vasa vasorum density and modulators of plaque vulnerability for cIMT (including by race). We anticipate that our findings will demonstrate a link between race, vasa vasorum density, atherosclerosis modulators, and CVD outcome. This finding would suggest that racial disparities in CVD are related, at least in part, to race-related differences in the pathophysiology of atheroscleros Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting for nearly 870,000 deaths each year. It is well established that race influences CVD outcome; blacks are disproportionately affected by CVD. However, the explanation for racial disparities in CVD is uncertain. Furthermore, optimal methods to reduce racial disparities in CVD have not been defined. Previous investigations and our own preliminary studies suggest that race-related differences exist in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. The present proposal will identify race-related differences in atherosclerosis plaque vulnerability (Specific Aim 1) and atherosclerosis modulators (Specific Aim 2). We expect to find that as compared to whites, blacks will have a greater density of vasa vasorum and plaque neovascularization, which are known to correlate with anatomic features of plaque vulnerability and to be representative of neovascularization throughout the arterial tree, and will have higher levels of circulating atherosclerosis modulators that mediate plaque vulnerability, independent of traditional CVD risk factors. We also anticipate that we will find that greater vasa vasorum and plaque neovascularization density, which is expected to be seen in blacks, is associated with higher circulating levels of atherosclerosis modulators and with subclinical atherosclerosis (Specific Aim 3). The anticipated link between race, vasa vasorum density, atherosclerosis modulators, subclinical atherosclerosis and CVD outcome will provide the foundation for the development and evaluation of race-specific pathophysiologic-guided risk stratification, preemption, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment strategies for CVD.","Racial Differences in Atherosclerosis, Plaque Vulnerability, and CVD",7523104,R01HL089292,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Microbubbles ', ' Thick ', ' Thickness ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Predictive Value ', ' Stratification ', ' in vivo ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Low Prevalence ', ' Evaluation Studies ', ' Characteristics ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' atherogenesis ', ' Arterial Fatty Streak ', ' vulnerable plaque ', ' atherosclerotic plaque ', ' atherosclerotic lesions ', ' atherosclerosis plaque ', ' Atheromatous plaque ', ' Atheromatous degeneration ', ' Atheromatous ', ' Atheroma ', ' Arterial Fatty Streaks ', ' coronary artery calcification ', ' coronary calcification ', ' Foundations ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' density ', ' Goals ', ' Heart ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Medial ', ' Acute ', ' Calcified ', ' Clinical ', ' Diffuse ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Biological ', ' Death Rate ', ' Link ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Evaluation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Endothelial Cells ', ' Laboratories ', ' Inflammation Mediators ', ' inflammatory mediator ', ' Methods ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Anatomy ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obstruction ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Syndrome ', ' Testing ', ' Trees ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Ultrasonography ', ' ultrasound scanning ', ' ultrasound imaging ', ' ultrasound ', ' sound measurement ', ' sonography ', ' sonogram ', ' diagnostic ultrasound ', ' Ultrasound Test ', ' Ultrasound Medical Imaging ', ' Ultrasound Diagnosis ', ' Ultrasonogram ', ' Ultrasonic Imaging ', ' Medical Ultrasound ', ' Echotomography ', ' Echography ', ' United States ', ' vasa vasorum ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Event ', ' Source ', ' Tobacco use ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Black race ', ' cohort ', ' Matrix Metalloproteinases ', ' MMPs ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' research study ', ' experimental study ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Carotid Arteries ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Accounting ', ' neovascularization ', ' arterial remodeling ', ' Prevalence ', ' prospective ', ' community based participatory research ', ' treatment strategy ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R01,2009,781510,0.2774714327877277
"Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) populations show disproportionate rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality, and eliminating these disparities is a priority objective of Healthy People 2010. Previous research suggests that in addition to many other variables, psychosocial factors may contribute to CVD disparities. The proposed research will use the Reserve Capacity Model (Gallo and Matthews, 2003) as a conceptual framework through which to examine the roles of stress, psychosocial resources, and emotional factors in SES and ethnic CVD disparities, in a community-based random sample of middle-aged, Mexican-American and non-Latino White women with relatively low and high SES (N=300). The Reserve Capacity Model posits that individuals with lower social status (low SES, minority ethnicity) may suffer negative emotional and physical health consequences due to stress experienced across multiple domains. Stress may exert direct effects on behavioral and physiological risk processes, or it may influence emotional variables which are themselves putative CVD risk factors. In addition, persons with low social status may maintain a smaller bank of resilient psychosocial resources with which to manage stress, making them especially vulnerable to concomitant physical and emotional wear and tear. The effects of low SES may be amplified in Latino women (i.e., synergistic effects). However, Mexican-American women could also benefit from resilient, socio-cultural resources that protect them, to some extent, from stress. In the current study, women will undergo a comprehensive assessment of SES, psychosocial factors, physiological and behavioral risk factors, and CVD biomarkers, and will participate in a two-day evaluation of ambulatory blood pressure and psychosocial experiences assessed via ecological momentary assessment. By examining potentially modifiable psychosocial variables as a pathway underlying CVD disparities, this study seeks to inform efforts to understand and eliminate health disparities.           ",Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways,7664926,R01HL081604,"['Lipids ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Metabolic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Anxiety ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' self esteem ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Investigation ', ' Woman ', ' Dimensions ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' experience ', ' Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ', ' ICAM-1 ', ' Glycoprotein ICAM 1 (human clone pHRVr1 deblocked protein moiety reduced) ', ' CD54 Antigens ', ' CD54 (ICAM 1) ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Social status ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Healthy People 2010 ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Population Group ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' Feeling hopeless ', ' hopelessness ', ' No hope for the future ', ' Negative about the future ', ' Loss of hope for the future ', ' Feels there is no future ', ' Cannot see a future ', ' Social Network ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' Behavioral ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' allostatic load ', ' base ', ' Health ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Hemostatic Agents ', ' Hemostatics ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' Hormones ', ' Therapeutic Hormone ', ' Endocrine Gland Secretion ', ' Chemotherapy-Hormones/Steroids ', ' Hostility ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Individual ', ' optimism ', ' postiive attitude ', ' Measures ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Relative ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stress ', ' Communities ', ' Underserved Population ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' positive emotional state ', ' positive emotion ', ' biopsychosocial ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' emotional factor ', ' biomarker ', ' depression ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,R01,2009,568059,0.08544414547675676
"CULTURAL FACTORS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK IN MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial research indicates that Mexican Americans are excessively vulnerable to the metabolic syndrome, with recent studies reporting metabolic syndrome prevalence rates of 30% or higher in this population. Because of the modifiable nature of the underlying causes of the metabolic syndrome and its strong association with cardiovascular disease (CVD), a better understanding of why Mexican Americans are predisposed to this condition is essential in any attempt to eliminate current CVD risk disparities in this population. The long-term goal of this research proposal is to contribute to the literature on CVD disparities in this at-risk population and to assist in the effort to eliminate such disparities. Toward this goal, the proposed research will examine the degree to which culturally-relevant variables represent risk and resilient factors for the metabolic syndrome. First, exploratory analyses will be conducted to examine: a) the nature and distributions of cultural characteristics considered potentially relevant to disease risk and resilience, including acculturation, familism, fatalism, and religiosity, and their co-variation and associations with sociodemographic characteristics; b) the relationship between cultural characteristics and behavioral risk factors relevant to the metabolic syndrome (i.e., dietary factors; physical activity); c) the relationship between cultural characteristics and metabolic syndrome indicators; and d) whether behavioral factors help explain   (i.e., ""mediate"") the relationship between cultural characteristics and metabolic syndrome variables. The training goals and research aims of the proposed plan will be accomplished in the context of two studies. The first study will examine archival data from a pilot project (South San Diego Women's Health Study; PI: L.C. Gallo; N=146) that served as the foundation for a study of the role of stress, psychosocial resources, and emotional factors in SES and ethnic CVD disparities in middle aged Mexican American women (Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways; PI: L. C. Gallo; N = 200). The second study will be used to conduct a comprehensive examination of the proposed cultural framework. A more inclusive understanding of the relevance of acculturation and Mexican cultural characteristics can help preserve any potential resiliency that exists and/or contribute to culturally sensitive approaches to risk prevention and intervention in this population.                   ",CULTURAL FACTORS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK IN MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN,7617889,F31HL087732,"['Cultural Characteristics ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' Literature ', ' Mexican ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Training Activity ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Woman ', ' waist circumference ', ' Behavior ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' emotional factor ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2009,28852,0.092179239808787
"Addressing Diabetes/CVD Health Disparities among American Indians: A Transdiscipl    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are at increased risk for Type 2 diabetes when compared to other Americans, a gap that continues to widen. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the number one cause of death among AI/ANs, is now more common among AI/ANs than others in the U.S. general population, and is increasing not only in prevalence but also in associated mortality. The greatest risk factor for CVD in AI/ANs is diabetes. Both CVD and diabetes share common risk factors, such as weight and lipid levels, which in turn are strongly related to diet and exercise behaviors. Effective preventive interventions focused on these behaviors hold promise for diminishing the diabetes and CVD disparities AI/ANs face. We propose to use the unique opportunity provided by the NCMHD's Social Determinants of Health Initiative (as part of RFA-OD-09-004) to assess the viability and sustainability of an intervention that makes accessible 2 electronic tools: 1) one for increasing exercise and 2) one for tracking diet and exercise among overweight/obese AI/ANs living in 2 urban areas. This work has 3 aims: 1) To determine whether introduction of 2 electronic devices leads to decreased risk for diabetes and CVD among overweight/obese AI/ANs; 2) To assess the social determinants of resultant changes in diabetes and CVD risk using sociobehavioral theories; and 3) To place the investigations of effectiveness (aims 1 and 2) in a larger translational framework by exploring aspects of reach, adoption, and implementation in order to understand issues of viability and sustainability of this and comparable interventions. This study will take place with 2 Indian Health Service-funded urban Indian clinic populations (Denver and Albuquerque) and be completed by a transdisciplinary team from the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health within the Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado Denver. The placement of this work within larger theoretical frameworks, as well as the focus on diabetes and CVD (diseases becoming more common among many Americans); renders this work for broad public health significance. We are experiencing a nationwide epidemic of overweight and obesity, with concomitant increases in diabetes, CVD, and other conditions. Health disparity populations, including American Indians and Alaska Natives; especially those who are unemployed, underemployed, or otherwise facing financial stress are even less likely to maintain healthy exercise and dietary habits. As we consider the health implications of the current recession, the importance of developing intervention methods which address possible decreases in exercise and healthy diet nationally due to increased financial stress is accentuated. To seize the opportunity do so in a way that allows the expansion of our theoretical understandings of behavior change is extraordinary.             We are experiencing a nationwide epidemic of overweight and obesity, with concomitant increases in diabetes, CVD, and other conditions.

"Disparities in CHD in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This K01 award will allow the candidate, Dr. Mario Sims, to gain the skills, knowledge and experience required to become an independent investigator in health disparities research. Using data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Dr. Sims will examine the extent to which neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and key psychosocial factors (discrimination, stress, and social support) impact coronary heart disease (CHD) in African Americans in Mississippi. The JHS is the largest epidemiologic, population-based study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among African Americans, and one of its primary aims - to develop young talented minority investigators in the field of CVD research - will be accomplished through this KO1 award. CHD is the leading cause of CVD mortality in America, and Mississippi has the highest overall CVD mortality rate in the nation. Moreover, the cardiovascular health disparity between African Americans and whites is widening. Mississippi's CHD mortality rate is higher than the U.S. rate. African Americans have higher CHD prevalence and mortality rates than whites, and they also have a higher prevalence of risk factors associated with CHD such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity which clearly might influence the higher prevalence of CHD mortality. To achieve his research and career development goals, Dr. Sims will follow a career development plan at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, designed to provide knowledge, skills, and experience in 6 core competencies required to be a successful independent investigator in health disparities research: 1) research excellence in the area of CHD disparities, 2) advanced statistics and study design, 3) research ethics, 4) leadership and management, 5) presentation and teaching, and 6) scientific writing. This will be accomplished through implementation of an individualized learning plan that includes: 1) academic coursework to develop cardiovascular disease disparity research skills; 2) mentorship and consultation with nationally and internationally recognized experts in cardiovascular disease epidemiology and health disparities research; 3) mentorship by faculty sensitive to the unique needs and issues facing minority academic faculty; and 4) innovative research using a multi-dimensional framework for examining how CHD prevalence among African Americans is influence by neighborhood environments, perceived discrimination, stress, and social support. The proposed mentored research has three specific aims: 1) to examine the extent to which neighborhood SES is associated with CHD among African Americans; 2) to determine the degree to which perceived racial discrimination, stress and social support are associated with CHD among African Americans; and 3) to analyze the extent to which the association of neighborhood SES and CHD is mediated by psychosocial factors among African Americans. This is the first study of its kind to examine multiple pathways by which neighborhood SES and key psychosocial factors impact CHD risk in African Americans in Mississippi, a state with the highest CHD rate in the nation.

"Gender Differences in Caloric Restriction Cardioprotection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant gender differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated. The risk of developing cardiovascular disease is considerably lower in pre-menopausal females than in age-matched males, whereas after menopause, the rate of cardiovascular disease in females rises sharply. This age- dependent reversal of female cardioprotection has been attributed to the loss of circulating female sex hormones, e.g. estrogen, in post-menopausal women. Studies in animal models also provide good evidence for direct cardioprotection by estrogen. However, clinical trials including the NIH Women's Health Initiative trial have failed to demonstrate cardioprotective benefit from hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in post- menopausal women. Resolving the current disparity requires a more complete understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in gender differences in cardioprotection. CR is the most extensively studied intervention that extends longevity and protects against stress. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that under CR, females are less tolerant to chronic catecholamine stress than males. If our findings that CR is not protective in pre-menopausal females are confirmed by this study, then understanding the molecular mechanisms mediating the adverse effects in females may shed light on those mechanisms mediating the adverse outcome of HRT therapy in post-menopausal women. There are two major hypotheses: Hypothesis A: Caloric restriction protects the heart of male mice from chronic catecholamine stress, but this is not observed in female mice. Hypothesis B: Caloric restriction induces numerous differences in gene regulation in males and females, and determining those genes that mediate the adverse effects of catecholamine stress in female caloric restricted mice may provide insight into mechanisms that are protective in the presence of pre-menopausal estrogen levels. Our study will reveal novel mechanisms of gender differences in cardioprotection in caloric restriction. The implications for Public Health are clear: understanding the cardiac protective mechanisms in caloric restricted males but not in females provide the direction for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-menopausal women have reduced risk for CVD, but the rate of CVD rises sharply after menopause. The loss of circulating female sex hormones, e.g. estrogen, has been suggested to contribute to this age- dependent reversal. However, clinical trials including the NIH Women's Health Initiative trial suggest that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is ineffective in reducing, and may actually increase CVD outcomes. The current application is to investigate the gender differences in cardioprotection in caloric restriction. We have found that the intervention of caloric restriction that extends longevity and protects against stress only protects the heart of male mice from cardiac stress, but this is not observed in female mice. Understanding the molecular mechanisms mediating the adverse effects in females may shed light on those mechanisms mediating the adverse outcome of HRT therapy in post-menopausal women and provide the direction for the treatment of CVD in post-menopausal women.           Project Narrative Pre-menopausal women have reduced risk for CVD, but the rate of CVD rises sharply after menopause.

"Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Neighborhood Segregation and Poverty    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite declines in cardiovascular disease (CVD) over the past 30 years, CVD remains the leading cause of death for Americans and contributes substantially to morbidity and disability (US DHHS 2000). Significant disparities exist in the prevalence of disease and its risk factors by race and socio-economic position and improvements in risk factors over time has been uneven (US DHS 2000; Kanjilal 2006; Mensah 2005; Kurian 2007). While racial disparities in CVD are well documented, their etiology is not well understood and the confounding effects of socio-economic position and residential segregation are not adequately accounted for in the literature (LaVeist 2005; LaVeist et al. forthcoming). Both residential segregation and concentrated poverty have been posited to be fundamental social determinants of proximate factors that produce racial disparities in CVD (Kanjilal 2006; Mensah 2005). However, few studies have tested this proposition empirically (Acevedo-Garcia et al. 2003). In this study, we propose to use the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) merged with census tract level data from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing Summary File 3. We will examine the association between CVD risk factors and both residential segregation and concentrated poverty and estimate the contribution of these factors to racial disparities. Clinical CVD risk factors to be examined will include: hypertension, diabetes, hyper-lipidemia, cardiovascular fitness, and obesity. Behavioral risk factors will include physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, nutrition, and screening practices. Finally, we will explore whether residential characteristics such as availability of food store outlets, health care providers, and walkability mediate the relationship between segregation, concentrated poverty and CVD risk factors. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will examine the social determinants of racial disparities in clinical and behavioral risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The project is designed to focus on the association between racial residential segregation and concentrated poverty on hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, cardiovascular fitness, and obesity and on physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, nutrition, and screening practices.

"Weight, Diet, Genes and CVD Risk Factors (Hypertension and Diabetes)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world (1- 3). Hypertension and diabetes, two of the major CVD risk factors, are complex diseases caused by the combined actions of genetic and environmental factors (4-8). Few studies have examined the interaction of these factors and fewer, if any, have looked at their effects in populations of developing Asian countries that are plagued with increasing levels of obesity and rapidly changing food environments (9, 10). The information gap may be due to the lack of population-based studies with adequate depth and detail. There is a paucity of information on dietary and adiposity trends derived from longitudinal studies and there are inadequate genetic data, especially among Asians who tend to develop CVD risk factors at lower body mass index thresholds (11, 12). Aims and Methods: The proposed study aims to understand how weight history, dietary patterns, and genetic variants independently and jointly affect blood pressure and fasting glucose among adult Filipino women (ages 38 to 71 yr in 2007) using the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS), an ongoing community-based study of over 2000 women (and their infants) which began in 1983. This is a unique dataset that contains not only rich genetic information on these women but also dietary and anthropometric measurements obtained since baseline, recent blood pressure (1998-2007) and fasting glucose (2005) measurements, and other individual-, household-, and community-level data collected over a span of 24 years of rapid country-wide socio-economic changes. Specifically, using multivariate regression methods we will determine the: (a) effect of weight history (i.e. duration of overweight) on the risk of having hypertension and/or diabetes; (b) association between dietary patterns (identified through cluster analysis) and hypertension and/or diabetes; (c) independence and co-occurrence of hypertension and diabetes and how these relate to weight and dietary patterns; and (d) effects of genetic variants on hypertension and diabetes, focusing on gene variants that have been associated with hypertension or diabetes by previous association studies. Further, the study will explore significant interaction of effects among genetic variants, overweight history and dietary patterns in affecting hypertension or diabetes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the independent and combined effects of genetic predisposition and modifiable factors such as weight and dietary patterns on the risks of having hypertension and diabetes, two major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The demographic and health trends in the Philippines exemplify those of other developing Asian countries where CVD-related morbidities and deaths are prevalent and increasing. Thus, studying the mechanisms that can lead to the development of hypertension and diabetes among Filipinos can provide critical information that may guide more tailored prevention efforts for these populations, potentially narrowing global health disparities.           This study will examine the independent and combined effects of genetic predisposition and modifiable factors such as weight and dietary patterns on the risks of having hypertension and diabetes, two major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

"Healthy Bodies, Healthy Hearts after Menopause    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dr. Margaret (Molly) B. Conroy is an Assistant Professor of Medicine and Epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh. She is applying for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23) in order to become an independent clinical investigator. Her proposal focuses on the relationships between physical activity, abdominal and muscular adiposity and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in women after menopause. Women are a high-risk population, as they are more likely to be physically inactive than men, a disparity that becomes more striking with advancing age. Following menopause, the incidence of CVD in women increases, while participation in regular physical activity declines. Further investigation is warranted of the pathways through which physical activity impacts CVD risk after menopause, particularly those incorporating body composition and potentially modifiable psychosocial factors. Dr. Conroy will examine these relationships and implement and evaluate a physical activity intervention in a clinical setting by pursuing three specific aims. Aim #1 will determine whether abdominal and muscular adiposity mediate the relationship between physical activity and subclinical cardiovascular disease risk in a cohort of postmenopausal women. Aim #2 will examine the relationships between changes in physical activity, abdominal and muscular adiposity and cardiovascular disease risk after an intensive lifestyle intervention. Aim #3 will involve a randomized, controlled physical activity intervention for early postmenopausal women that adapts clinical trial methods and translates them to the primary care patient population and practice setting. Aim #1 will be addressed by an ancillary study in the Women on the Move through Activity and Nutrition (WOMAN) cohort. Aim #2 will be addressed in the Slow Adverse Vascular Effects (SAVE) study. Aim #3 wiN be addressed by recruiting an intervention cohort from Dr. Conroy's primary care clinic. Experts in the fields of physical activity and CVD epidemiology, translational research, behavioral medicine and intervention design will supervise Dr. Conroy's career development.

"Gender Race and Ethnic Disparities Research in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Gender and racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been well documented over the past decade of research. The applicant for renewal of a Midcareer Research Award, Dr. Lori Mosca, and many of her mentees, have contributed substantially to advancement of our knowledge in this field as a result of the initial K24 award, during which time Dr. Mosca was promoted to Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. Substantial questions remain regarding the reasons for discrepancies in care and outcomes, a critical scientific gap that could inform interventions designed to reduce gender and racial/disparities in the prevention and treatment of CVD. The goal of this award is to provide the applicant with protected time to increase the pool of high quality multidisciplinary patient oriented researchers dedicated to a) understanding the independent contributions of gender and race/ethnicity to CVD outcomes and b) developing novel interventions targeted to modifiable factors that may reduce disparities. The award will also support the applicant's time to interact with and learn from other senior investigators with an interest in CVD disparities research, an appropriate and important commitment for her stage of career development. Extensive preliminary data by the applicant and her mentees has documented disparities in CVD awareness, risk factor control, and barriers to prevention. The proposed research provides a timely scientific opportunity to garner data from existing and ongoing studies uniquely suited to evaluate independent contributors to disparities and inform the design of future clinical trials and interventions aimed to reduce CVD disparities. The specific aims of the research include: 1) To examine the association between race/ethnic group and a) awareness of coronary heart disease as the leading cause of death in women, b) knowledge of heart attack symptoms and actions to take when experiencing heart attack symptoms, and c) perceptions of preventive/alternative therapies for coronary heart disease risk reduction, among nationally representative samples of women surveyed triennially from 1997-2009, 2) To determine whether the effectiveness of a screening and education program for family members of patients hospitalized with CVD to improve lifestyle factors over one year varies by race/ethnic group and to examine acculturation, baseline risk, and psychosocial factors as potential confounders/effect modifiers of program effectiveness and 3) To ascertain whether control of CVD risk factors is independently associated with race/ethnic group among consecutive patients admitted to the cardiovascular disease service line of a major medical center, and to determine whether the association with medication adherence and having a paid or non-paid (family member/friend) caregiver prior to hospitalization. The significance and impact of this research is that it will extend our knowledge about health disparities and will address the etiology of differential outcomes with the goal of developing effective interventions to optimize cardiovascular health among populations that bear a disproportionate burden of CVD risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This purpose of this research is to contribute to a reduction in gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease prevention through innovative approaches to study the causes of health disparities and to use the knowledge gained to inform targeted educational programs and to design future clinical studies aimed to reduce disparities and improve cardiovascular health for all.           Relevance This purpose of this research is to contribute to a reduction in gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease prevention through innovative approaches to study the causes of health disparities and to use the knowledge gained to inform targeted educational programs and to design future clinical studies aimed to reduce disparities and improve cardiovascular health for all.",Gender Race and Ethnic Disparities Research in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention,8045014,K24HL076346,[''],NHLBI,COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HEALTH SCIENCES,K24,2010,190649,0.20582849547625706
"Lifecourse SES and Cardiovascular Disease Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will take advantage of data that were collected as a part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA), a longitudinal investigation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in an adult community sample, to examine potential explanations for socioeconomic disparities in CVD. A major focus is to understand how changes in socioeconomic status (SES) over the lifecourse influence future CVD risk, and the extent to which the association between SES change and CVD risk is moderated by race/ethnicity and gender. Specifically, emphasis is placed on the possibility that psychosocial factors related to SES may influence future subclinical atherosclerotic burden by modulating processes thought to be related to CVD pathogenesis (blood pressure [BP] and chronic low grade inflammation and oxidative stress) via regulation of adrenal hormone activity. Emphasis also is placed on the possibility that changes in SES over the lifecourse may be paralleled by changes in health behaviors and that   the evolution of health behaviors over time might explain the association of SES with CVD risk factors. We take two different approaches to the analysis of lifecourse SES: we examine (a) trajectories of change in SES during young and middle adulthood; and (b) a total lifecourse model that incorporates measures of childhood SES. We also examine whether perceived social standing is associated with CVD risk factors, and whether this association explains the link between objective SES and CVD risk.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will make a unique contribution to the study of SES disparities in CVD risk by employing a lifecourse approach that incorporates (a) analysis of change in SES trajectories across young and middle adulthood, (b) measures of childhood as well as adult SES, and (c) examination of whether the influence of SES factors on CVD risk differs according to race/ethnicity and gender. There are several reasons to take a lifecourse approach to the examination of SES disparities in CVD risk. First of all, being able to identify when during the lifecourse SES begins to influence CVD risk, and how the effects of early status combine with those of adult status to further influence risk will enhance our understanding of SES disparities in CVD. Second, revealing an association of lifecourse SES with subclinical atherosclerosis could have important clinical implications insofar as it would allow for identification and tracking of individuals who may be at elevated risk for clinical CVD at early points in the course of the disease that may be more responsive to early preventive treatment. Finally, revealing an association of lifecourse SES with biological and behavioral factors known to contribute to CVD pathogenesis will provide us with additional insight into mechanisms whereby relative socioeconomic disadvantage can be translated into cardiovascular pathology. Obtaining a fuller understanding of when and how socioeconomic factors influence CVD risk, and whether the nature and strength of this influence differs between Blacks and Whites and men and women, can have important implications for public health insofar as it will enable the development of targeted preventive strategies that ultimately can lessen the burden of CVD across the socioeconomic hierarchy.            Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Deverts, Denise, Janicki PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will make a unique contribution to the study of SES disparities in CVD risk by employing a lifecourse approach that incorporates (a) analysis of change in SES trajectories across young and middle adulthood, (b) measures of childhood as well as adult SES, and (c) examination of whether the influence of SES factors on CVD risk differs according to race/ethnicity and gender.

"Assessing Biological Pathways: Linking Neighborhoods to Cardiovascular Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing number of studies report gender differences in how the neighborhood environment impacts individual health behaviors, health status, and/or mortality. Although research in this domain has made great strides, researchers are still in the early stages of identifying the biological pathways through which neighborhood characteristics actually ""get under the skin,"" and the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) call for gender- based analyses has not been fulfilled. More specifically, research to date has lacked the necessary combination of data on individual-level sociodemographic, health behavior and biological markers, objective neighborhood data, and follow-up data on individual mortality. Also, there is a dearth of work systematically assessing gender differences in the association of neighborhood factors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the United States. We propose to address this gap in the literature by assessing biological pathways between key aspects of the residential environment and CVD mortality in a national sample of adults. The specific aims of this proposed research are to: 1. Assess the relationship between selected characteristics of the neighborhood environment (i.e., neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES), population density, and residential stability) and acquired biological risk factors for CVD and examine whether these relationships differ by gender, controlling for key individual-level health behavior and sociodemographic characteristics. 2. Assess the relationship between acquired biological risk factors for CVD and subsequent CVD mortality, and examine whether they differ by gender, controlling for key individual-level health behavior and sociodemographic characteristics. 3. Assess the role of acquired biological risk factors for CVD as mediating pathways between the selected characteristics of the neighborhood environment and CVD mortality, and examine how their role may differ by gender, controlling for key individual-level health behavior and sociodemographic characteristics. The proposed project will draw on integrated data from five major sources: (1) Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), (2) the NHANES 1999-2004; (3) United States Census; (4) RAND Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) Data Core; and (5) National Death Index (NDI). Biomarkers are available through the NHANES data, including both traditional and more recently identified predictors of CVD risk and mortality. Taken together, these data provide a unique opportunity to assess key pathways between neighborhood context and men's and women's CVD risk and subsequent mortality.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research focuses on aspects of the social and physical environment of neighborhoods interventions in the area of building, housing, and land-use policy could address. This work will shed light on how related public policy efforts and public health interventions, particularly in the area of cardiovascular health, could-in the long term-improve health behaviors, cardiovascular risk factors, and survival, as well as reduce health disparities. The proposed gender-based analysis can also help inform efforts to improve population health for both men and women without inadvertently increasing health disparities.              PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research focuses on aspects of the social and physical environment of neighborhoods interventions in the area of building, housing, and land-use policy could address.

"Diet Quality and CVD Risk Factors in a Family Based Weight Management Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Family Weight Management Study (FamWtStudy) (1R18-DK075981) is designed to evaluate the effects of a 12-month, family-based intervention designed to improve BMI z-scores and CVD risk factors in children ages 7-12 years living in a community with a high minority representation, who have a BMI z-score >85th percentile.  The families recruited will be randomized to either the Control or Experimental Intervention group. The Control Intervention group will receive a booklet with targets for healthy eating behaviors, a handout on how to increase physical activity, and quarterly visits that will include a brief review of lifestyle recommendations. The Experimental Intervention group will receive weekly sessions for 3 months that include a core diet and physical activity curriculum followed by monthly post-core sessions for 9 months promoting adherence to the curriculum. Targeted diet strategies in the core curriculum include increasing highly pigmented fruit and vegetable, and fish intake; substituting non-fat and low-fat for full-fat milk and dairy products; and reducing meat, fried food and savory snack intakes. During the one-year intervention period social support and tailored individualized counseling will be provided to the families, augmented with telephone calls and home visits addressing barriers to adherence. The goal of this ancillary study application is to expand the scope of the FamWtStudy to include 1) measures of diet quality biomarkers in child-mother/female guardian pairs, 2) measures of CVD risk factors in children and mothers/female guardians, and 3) assessment of associations within child-mother/female guardian pairs for diet quality biomarkers and CVD risk factors pre-intervention and post-intervention change. Each biomarker for diet quality was chosen because it is an indicator of a different component of the diet targeted by the parent study and can provide an indication of adherence - red blood cell (RBC) 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 for vegetable oil, meat and fish; plasma carotenoids and phylloquinone for highly pigmented fruits and vegetables; RBC 15:0 for full-fat milk and dairy products; and RBC trans fatty acids and plasma dihydrophylloquinone for fried food and savory snacks. Measuring the CVD risk factors (total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, hsCRP, glucose and insulin concentrations, blood pressure and waist circumference) in the children and mothers/female guardians, will allow for an assessment of 'spill-over' effect within families and concordance within child-mother/female guardian pairs. Regardless of the outcomes, the results will provide critical data with which to design subsequent interventions in minority communities to increase the impact of family-based obesity prevention programs and public health importance because the data will provide information in an area that continues to challenge current efforts to stem the tide of childhood obesity in a high-risk subgroup and an area that threatens to overwhelm our healthcare system. The response is time-sensitive because the FamWtStudy intervention started in August, 2009 and it is critical to have resources to collect, process, archive, transfer and analyze plasma and RBC samples.   Public Health Relevance:  The results of the proposed work will be of public health importance because they will provide objective measures for the effectiveness of a family-based program designed to prevent excess weight gain in high-risk children and potential 'spill-over' effects in the mothers/female guardians of the children. The objective measures will include indicators of diet quality and cardiovascular disease risk factors in the children and their mothers/female guardians, as well as the relationship of change within children and mothers/female guardian pairs. Developing and evaluating strategies to prevent excess weight gain is critical to support current efforts to stem the tide of childhood obesity in the U.S., a public health problem that threatens to overwhelm our healthcare system.

"Mentoring in community influences on CVD risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a proposal for a midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research. This career development award will give Dr. Corbie-Smith the dedicated time to focus on patient-oriented research in cardiovascular disease prevention, and recruit and mentor some of the brightest young scientists at UNC into healthcare disparities research. Her immediate career objectives are: 1) To extend her work in engaging communities of color in research by developing interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease that address patients in the context of their communities; 2) To understand the influence of community factors in underserved communities and their impact on healthcare utilization and health outcomes in cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors; and 3) To provide outstanding mentorship by creating a training environment that supports the conduct of high impact research in cardiovascular prevention and outcomes. The specific aims for the new research to be supported through this K24 Midcareer Investigator award include 1) Determine the feasibility of training a current cohort of community health advisors as navigators to link residents with multiple cardiovascular risk factors to local healthcare systems; 2) Determine the impact of navigators on cardiovascular risk factor control (HgbA1C, physical activity, BP control, smoking) and access to care for community members at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; 3) Identify community and social factors that influence cardiovascular risk factor control and outcomes. This two-arm trial will investigate the role of navigators on cardiovascular outcomes in community based outreach programs to improve access and utilization of medical services. Two to three navigators at each of the four sites will be utilized. Patients will be randomized to either a navigator intervention or to usual patient management practices, with measurement at baseline and six months. This study targets a disease condition and population of significant importance - CVD risk factor prevention in rural African Americans - and extends an existing effective model in several important ways. This study situates the navigator and patient within the community (rather than the healthcare system) thus increasing the cultural relevance of the intervention. Rather than a focus on one condition, navigators will support access and management of several chronic conditions, thus addressing the reality of multiple co-morbidities in underserved patients. Lastly, augmenting patient data with community variables allows a comprehensive analysis of external influence on cardiovascular disease prevention and healthcare utilization.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will advance public health by testing a patient navigator program to improve access to and quality of care for those with heart disease risk factors.

"Health Disparities and CVD: Admixture Mapping in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genetic risk for complex processes like CVD appears to involve interactions among multiple genes of small effect. Association mapping is much more powerful than linkage mapping in identifying such genes, but requires 200-500 times as many markers to scan the genome. Admixture mapping can extract much of the power of association studies but requires genotyping only a few thousand markers genome-wide. This application partners Jackson Heart Study (JHS) investigators with two leaders in the field of admixture mapping, Drs. David Reich and Nick Patterson. The studies proposed will exploit the genotyping and analytic power of the Broad Institute to perform admixture mapping in the largest cohort ever assembled to study CVD in African Americans. Several factors contribute to the timeliness of this study and show the strength of the proposed research team: (a) Our group has published the first practical genetic resource for admixture mapping: 2,154 markers with large frequency differences between Africans and Europeans, and methods to analyze the data. (b) We have assembled a unique cohort for the largest-ever genome-wide admixture scan for CVD risk genes: 3,796 unrelated African Americans rigorously characterized for a large number of CVD phenotypes, including HTN, coronary artery disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, and heart failure. (c) Admixture mapping has had its first empiric successes, localizing genes for hypertension and multiple sclerosis. Admixture mapping works in practice, making it critically important to apply it to seek CVD genes in the JHS cohort. We propose three specific aims: Specific Aim 1: Whole-genome admixture scanning for CVD related genes. We will type 3,072 admixture mapping markers in DMA of 3,796 unrelated African American participants from the JHS cohort. We will concentrate our analyses on phenotypes with known differences in prevalence between African Americans and Europeans: hypertension, serum lipid levels, left ventricular hypertrophy, and low birth weight. Specific Aim 2: Follow-up and fine-mapping of the two strongest peaks of association. We will genotype 2,535 additional SNPs/peak in 940 participants (470 at each extreme for the selected phenotype). Specific Aim 3: Acquire all recorded birth weights for JHS participants. Birth weight will be analyzed both as a covariate for CVD phenotypes and as an independent phenotype, by admixture mapping. Lav language description: Finding genes that affect the risk of disease can identify new targets for drug treatment and lead to the development of important medical tests. These studies will seek genes of African and European origin that cause heart and blood vessel diseases in African Americans.

"The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significant disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, prevalence, and health outcomes persist among racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Although Healthy People 2010 (HP) and national clinical guidelines endorse lifestyle change for preventing and reducing CVD prevalence, numerous barriers limit health behavior change in many minority and low-income communities. New risk reduction strategies are needed using community-based participatory research (CBPR) techniques, which allow researchers and communities to combine their efforts promoting health, preventing disease, and reducing health disparities. Collaborative strategies must move beyond investigating behavior change alone and begin focusing on behavior change maintenance. The GoodNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness and Spiritual Growth) Trial is an 18-month effectiveness trial with an 18-month extended maintenance study, among 20 African-American and low- income congregations participating in the GoodNEWS faith-based lay health promotion program. After training, congregations will be randomized to either GoodNEWS with a health maintenance intervention (GoodNEWS-l) or GoodNEWS program alone (GoodNEWS-PA). The maintenance intervention combines elements of the medical care model and features of community-based support. Primary data collection will occur at baseline, 18, and 36 months with the two primary outcomes being levels of physical activity as measured by 7- Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) and dietary change as measured by the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). The primary hypothesis is that the maintenance group will significantly increase physical activity and healthy eating behavior compared to the program only group. We also hypothesize that lipoprotein and glucose levels, and blood pressure will be significantly improved over baseline in the GoodNEWS-l group and that these changes will be significantly greater than in the GoodNEWS-PA group. At the end of the trial, both groups will continue in an 18-month extended maintenance study. Relevance to Public Health: The GoodNEWS Trial is consistent with the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities. Lifestyle change is an important strategy for reducing CVD prevalence in high- risk populations. The proposed study will contribute to greater understanding of community-based health promotion and primary prevention strategies for reducing risk factors for heart disease and stroke in these populations, and maintaining lifestyle and behavior change over time.             ","The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial",7862506,R01HL087768,"['Data

"Weight, Diet, Genes and CVD Risk Factors (Hypertension and Diabetes)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world (1- 3). Hypertension and diabetes, two of the major CVD risk factors, are complex diseases caused by the combined actions of genetic and environmental factors (4-8). Few studies have examined the interaction of these factors and fewer, if any, have looked at their effects in populations of developing Asian countries that are plagued with increasing levels of obesity and rapidly changing food environments (9, 10). The information gap may be due to the lack of population-based studies with adequate depth and detail. There is a paucity of information on dietary and adiposity trends derived from longitudinal studies and there are inadequate genetic data, especially among Asians who tend to develop CVD risk factors at lower body mass index thresholds (11, 12). Aims and Methods: The proposed study aims to understand how weight history, dietary patterns, and genetic variants independently and jointly affect blood pressure and fasting glucose among adult Filipino women (ages 38 to 71 yr in 2007) using the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS), an ongoing community-based study of over 2000 women (and their infants) which began in 1983. This is a unique dataset that contains not only rich genetic information on these women but also dietary and anthropometric measurements obtained since baseline, recent blood pressure (1998-2007) and fasting glucose (2005) measurements, and other individual-, household-, and community-level data collected over a span of 24 years of rapid country-wide socio-economic changes. Specifically, using multivariate regression methods we will determine the: (a) effect of weight history (i.e. duration of overweight) on the risk of having hypertension and/or diabetes; (b) association between dietary patterns (identified through cluster analysis) and hypertension and/or diabetes; (c) independence and co-occurrence of hypertension and diabetes and how these relate to weight and dietary patterns; and (d) effects of genetic variants on hypertension and diabetes, focusing on gene variants that have been associated with hypertension or diabetes by previous association studies. Further, the study will explore significant interaction of effects among genetic variants, overweight history and dietary patterns in affecting hypertension or diabetes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the independent and combined effects of genetic predisposition and modifiable factors such as weight and dietary patterns on the risks of having hypertension and diabetes, two major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The demographic and health trends in the Philippines exemplify those of other developing Asian countries where CVD-related morbidities and deaths are prevalent and increasing. Thus, studying the mechanisms that can lead to the development of hypertension and diabetes among Filipinos can provide critical information that may guide more tailored prevention efforts for these populations, potentially narrowing global health disparities.           This study will examine the independent and combined effects of genetic predisposition and modifiable factors such as weight and dietary patterns on the risks of having hypertension and diabetes, two major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors.

"A COMBINED LIFESTYLE AND MEDICATION INTERVENTION TO REDUCE CVD RISK    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of death and disability in the US. While lifestyle and medication use can substantially reduce CVD risk, both are underused forms of treatment. Accordingly, we propose to combine previously tested and effective lifestyle and medication interventions to reduce CVD risk and test this intervention in a diverse group of patients cared for at family practices in North Carolina. Our plan is to identify a potential intervention that is practical for use in common office settings supported by community resources so that it may reach a large segment of the population and thus have major public health impact. In recognition of increasing access to the internet and differing costs and in-puts related to web-based vs. counselor-based interventions, we will compare the effectiveness and feasibility of the combined intervention in two formats, web-based and counselor-based. Using a comparative effectiveness research framework, we plan to compare these intervention formats for their impact on estimated CVD risk reduction and other important outcomes to key clinical and public health stakeholders (patients, payers, and decision makers); in particular, feasibility, acceptability, and cost-effectiveness outcomes. To do so, we will conduct this study at 5 family practices, enrolling 120 patients per practice. We will randomize participants within site to one of the 2 treatment conditions, both including a baseline assessment and a theory informed intervention with a 4 month intensive phase (4 sessions) and an 8 month maintenance phase (3 contacts). Outcomes will be assessed at 4 and 12 months, with the primary outcome a reduction in the estimated 10 year risk of coronary heart disease as determined by the Framingham equation. Changes in dietary intake, physical activity, blood pressure, blood lipids, and medication use, in addition to feasibility, acceptability and cost, are important secondary outcomes. To optimize dissemination of study findings to decision makers and the interventions to practitioners, we will 1) elicit input from stakeholders at the outset to guide our development of the intervention and 2) use an existing web-based mechanism, (Center of Excellence for Training and Research Translation) for intervention training, translation, and dissemination.   Project Summary: Statement of problem: Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. While lifestyle and appropriate use of medication can substantially reduce this risk, both are underused forms of treatment.   Purpose of proposed research: To combine previously tested and effective lifestyle and medication interventions to reduce CVD risk and test this intervention in a diverse group of patients cared for at family practices in North Carolina.

"Center for Reduce CVD Disparities: Genes, Clinics, and Communities Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affect low income and minority populations. Lenoir County, North Carolina is among the poorest in the state and situated in the ""stroke belt"" with significantly elevated heart disease, stroke, and obesity rates relative to state levels already well above the national average. At the same time, this county is home to many clinical and public health efforts on which to build. We propose an integrated set of three interdisciplinary studies in Lenoir County to: 1) determine genetic factors associated with CVD risk; 2) understand the multilevel determinants of poor health outcomes and the potential social and community capital that can support sustainable change; 3) work with community leaders, health professionals, and citizens to apply these understandings to improved practice-based management of hypertension and community-centered lifestyle management, and test the impact on improving outcomes and reducing disparities in cardiovascular health among 700 participants. This will include an innovative partnership with a nonprofit call center, Connect Inc, adding a lifestyle and medication adherence coaching component to their current focus on jobs, employment, and benefits counseling; 4) test the impact, reach, adoption, and sustainability of clinical, community-level, and policy interventions , including economic development potential; and 5) develop and implement strategies for translation and dissemination of the clinic-based and community-level interventions to other underserved regions.

"Sociodemographic Regulation of CV Function and Structure    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D) and their comorbidity pose important health challenges for the United States in the coming decades. African Americans (AAs) have a greater prevalence of T2D and have higher CVD and T2D related mortality rates compared with European Americans (EAs). Environmental stress has been postulated as playing an important role in the development of CVD and T2D, particularly among AAs, but little is known about underlying physiological mechanisms linking stress to early etiology of CVD and T2D. Assessment of possible differential impact of chronic environmental stress upon longitudinal development and manifestation of preclinical markers of CVD and T2D in AAs and EAs can be accomplished only with proper control for genetic influences. Employment of a genetically and environmentally informative twin study design enables genetic variation contributing to individual variation [heritability (h2)] to be controlled for and environmental influences [environmentality = 1-h2] to be quantified. The fundamental objective of this proposal is to identify whether exposure to chronic stress is associated with development of early risk markers of CVD and T2D and whether this differs between AAs and EAs. Collecting data on 2 additional occasions in the Georgia CV Twin study (523 pairs, 302 EA and 221 AA) who will be T9.5¿3.5 yrs old will yield 5 evaluations over a crucial time span capturing the transition from childhood into adulthood. Particularly informative will be addition of new indices of sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation (i.e., urinary excretion rate of norepinephrine and salivary cortisol), the metabolic syndrome (i.e., blood pressure, high density lipoprotein, triglycerides, waist circumference, fasting glucose and insulin), environmental stress (e.g., childhood trauma, job strain, perceived discrimination and unfairness, community social status) and a measure of vascular function (i.e., arterial stiffness). Relevance to public health: lncreased understanding of the role of environmental stress related factors and their underlying physiological mechanisms as contributors to health disparities between AAs and EAs will assist in earlier and better identification of youth and young adults at increased risk for CVD and T2D. It will also aid the development of more personalized primary prevention programs involving lifestyle interventions in which the role of chronic stress will be taken into account to prevent early onset of these diseases.           ",Sociodemographic Regulation of CV Function and Structure,7807093,R01HL056622,"['Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', '

"Effects of Yoga on CVD Risk Factors among African Americans: Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and continues to be one of the nation's largest racial health disparity conditions: compared to non-Hispanic whites, African Americans are 30 percent more likely to die from heart disease and 60 percent more likely to die from a stroke. African Americans are also more likely than whites to have risk factors for CVD, such as hypertension and elevated levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c. Clinical studies of the effects of yoga on mitigating CVD risk factors, although small in nature, have demonstrated promising results. The proposed study, which utilizes a randomized, hybrid phase-in/cross- over design, includes 500 adult hypertensive or pre-hypertensive African American participants from the Jackson Heart Study to test the effect of yoga classes three times per week for 12 weeks on CVD risk factors. The three specific aims of the study are to measure the effect yoga can have on (1) risks for CVD, including hypertension, inflammation, and elevated levels of lipids and hemoglobin A1c; (2) perceived levels of stress; and (3) health behaviors and health-related quality of life. Primary outcomes will be changes in participants' systolic and diastolic blood pressure and their levels of CRP, fibrinogen, homocysteine, and interleukin-6. Secondary outcomes will be changes in participants' levels of HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and fasting triglycerides; their perceived levels of stress; and their reported health behaviors and health-related quality of life. Because of the number of participants and the rigor of the research design, this study will be the first of its kind. The study team is in the fortunate position to be able to recruit and retain a large number of participants because of its longstanding-and remarkably close-relationship through their joint association with the Jackson Heart Study. Results will be disseminated on a large scale to a variety of professional and lay audiences. If the results of the intervention yield statistically significant improvement in individuals' CVD risk factors, the nation will benefit from an easily replicable model that can be used to help reduce CVD risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and African Americans have higher rates of heart disease and their risk factors than do whites. We want to see if practicing yoga three times a week can help reduce risk factors for heart disease in African Americans.

"Northern Manhattan Healthy Heart Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northern Manhattan Healthy Heart Initiative (NMHHI) is in response to the NHLBI's interest in interventions that address multiple risk factors for people at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and utilizes the existing framework for community based participatory research in our NIH funded Center of Excellence on Health Disparities Research. We propose to examine the effectiveness of a Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention in CVD risk reduction among Caribbean Latinos. Although CHWs programs have exited in the US for over 4 decades, numerous recent reviews continue to identify the lack of rigorous evaluation data as the primary barrier limiting the dissemination of CHW programs. Our proposal addresses specific research priority needs of our community planning council. Our community partners participated in all aspects of the proposal including conception, jointly formulating the study design, and developing and writing major sections of the study intervention. The study design is a randomized controlled trial of 800 Latino patients aged 35-65 with hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia being cared at 7 primary care sites. The study builds on a successful diabetes CHW program previously developed by our community partners and our medical center. The Specific Aim is to determine if a community based CHW intervention results in lowering of CVD risk factors at 18 months as measured by the Total Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Additional primary outcomes include blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. Secondary objectives will determine if the CHW intervention results in improvements in the following putative mechanisms that may influence the FRS: 1) Medication adherence; 2) Improvements in diet and exercise; and 3) Self efficacy, all measured using culturally validated instruments. At study conclusion we will also examine the cost effectiveness of our intervention. Our CHW intervention uses the Chronic Care Model as an overarching framework and builds on existing programmatic strengths at each CBO. Our two community partners will have a major role in this application including primary responsibly for subject recruitment, hiring and training the CHWs, delivering the CHW intervention, and collaborating on study finding dissemination. This is reflected in the budget, half of which is to the community partners. The dissemination activities to be undertaken by our team will prioritize developing mechanisms for the sustainability of the CHW intervention including discussions with our local Medicaid managed care plans which have ongoing interests in innovative cost-effective culturally appropriate health care delivery models such as CHWs. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Heart disease is the leading cause of death among Hispanics. Hispanics also have many risk factors for heart disease.

"Subclinical CVD in African American Type 2 Diabetics    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term objective of the African American-Diabetes Heart Study is to identify the causes of the markedly lower amounts of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in African American (AA) subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), relative to European Americans (EA). Additional goals are to evaluate the impacts of lifestyle, environment and inherited factors on the development of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to identify genomic regions contributing to the inherited component of subclinical CVD in AAs with T2DM. These goals will be achieved by the concerted efforts of clinicians, epidemiologists, biostatisticians, biochemists, and molecular geneticists, building on work that was previously performed in the parent Diabetes Heart Study (DHS). Specifically, we will ascertain, phenotype, and collect DMA from an additional 566 unrelated AAs with T2DM, combining their information with 90 unrelated AA diabetic subjects previously recruited into the DHS (656 subjects total). Clinical risk factor profiles will be created for each participant and we will assess subclinical and clinical CVD using Multi-Detector Row Computed Tomography of the coronary and carotid arteries and infra-renal aorta. We will next examine the impact of conventional CVD risk factors (smoking, lipids and lipoproteins, hypertension and glycemic control) and novel risk factors (sex hormones and other endocrine measures, calcium regulating hormones, calcification inhibitors and inflammatory biomarkers) on the development of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in AAs with T2DM. We will investigate ethnic differences in calcified atheromatous plaque by comparing the above results with those obtained in a matched cohort of EA subjects with T2DM from the parent DHS. In years 4 and 5, we will screen the genome using Mapping by Admixture Linkage Disequilibrium (MALD) in an expanded sample of 1,100 unrelated AA subjects with T2DM (444 previously recruited in existing studies and 656 locally recruited) to locate genomic regions that harbor calcified atherosclerotic plaque susceptibility genes in the diabetic AA population. These strategies will provide novel information on causes of the marked ethnic disparity in subclinical CVD, will assist in identifying genes that predispose to CVD in AA subjects with T2DM, and may lead to the development of novel treatment strategies to prevent hardening of the arteries.              ",Subclinical CVD in African American Type 2

"Gender Differences in Caloric Restriction Cardioprotection    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Significant gender differences in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease have been demonstrated. The risk of developing cardiovascular disease is considerably lower in pre-menopausal females than in age-matched males, whereas after menopause, the rate of cardiovascular disease in females rises sharply. This age- dependent reversal of female cardioprotection has been attributed to the loss of circulating female sex hormones, e.g. estrogen, in post-menopausal women. Studies in animal models also provide good evidence for direct cardioprotection by estrogen. However, clinical trials including the NIH Women's Health Initiative trial have failed to demonstrate cardioprotective benefit from hormone replacement therapy (HRT) in post- menopausal women. Resolving the current disparity requires a more complete understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in gender differences in cardioprotection. CR is the most extensively studied intervention that extends longevity and protects against stress. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that under CR, females are less tolerant to chronic catecholamine stress than males. If our findings that CR is not protective in pre-menopausal females are confirmed by this study, then understanding the molecular mechanisms mediating the adverse effects in females may shed light on those mechanisms mediating the adverse outcome of HRT therapy in post-menopausal women. There are two major hypotheses: Hypothesis A: Caloric restriction protects the heart of male mice from chronic catecholamine stress, but this is not observed in female mice. Hypothesis B: Caloric restriction induces numerous differences in gene regulation in males and females, and determining those genes that mediate the adverse effects of catecholamine stress in female caloric restricted mice may provide insight into mechanisms that are protective in the presence of pre-menopausal estrogen levels. Our study will reveal novel mechanisms of gender differences in cardioprotection in caloric restriction. The implications for Public Health are clear: understanding the cardiac protective mechanisms in caloric restricted males but not in females provide the direction for the treatment of cardiovascular disease in post-menopausal women. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Pre-menopausal women have reduced risk for CVD, but the rate of CVD rises sharply after menopause. The loss of circulating female sex hormones, e.g. estrogen, has been suggested to contribute to this age- dependent reversal. However, clinical trials including the NIH Women's Health Initiative trial suggest that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is ineffective in reducing, and may actually increase CVD outcomes. The current application is to investigate the gender differences in cardioprotection in caloric restriction. We have found that the intervention of caloric restriction that extends longevity and protects against stress only protects the heart of male mice from cardiac stress, but this is not observed in female mice. Understanding the molecular mechanisms mediating the adverse effects in females may shed light on those mechanisms mediating the adverse outcome of HRT therapy in post-menopausal women and provide the direction for the treatment of CVD in post-menopausal women.           Project Narrative Pre-menopausal women have reduced risk for CVD, but the rate of CVD rises sharply after menopause.

"The Native Proverbs 31 Health Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) rates have increased dramatically among American Indians in recent years. Modifiable CVD risk factors, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, sedentary behavior, and tobacco use are generally higher in most American Indian communities compared to non-Hispanic whites, although there is limited understanding of the unique cultural aspects of appropriate CVD primary prevention strategies in these populations. The Lumbee Indian tribe, a non-reservation tribe with a population of about 50,000, is the largest American Indian tribe east of the Mississippi River, and is largely concentrated in Robeson County, in southeastern North Carolina (NC). This county is largely rural, has a high poverty rate, and is almost equally divided among American Indians, African Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Limited available data indicate that CVD and its risk factors are very high among American Indians in North Carolina in general and Lumbees in particular. The Lumbee tribe is largely Christian, and the church is a very important component of Lumbee culture, providing opportunities to develop church-based health interventions in this population. The proposed project, entitled, ""The Native Proverbs 31 Health Project,"" is in response to RFA-MD-10-004 (NCMHD Innovative Faith-based Approaches to Health Disparities Research). This project is designed to develop, implement and evaluate a CVD prevention program among Lumbee Indian women in Robeson County, NC, focusing on the biblical messages in Proverbs 31. The following aims will be performed 1) Based on prior research and formative work in the community, collaboratively develop a community-based, culturally appropriate CVD intervention program for Lumbee Indian women in Robeson County, NC, focusing on the health-related messages in biblical passage in Proverbs 31; 2) Implement a 6-month CVD intervention program in four Lumbee Indian churches in Robeson County, NC, using a community health / lay health educator model. 3) Evaluate the community-based, culturally appropriate CVD intervention program on diet, physical activity and tobacco use among Lumbee women using a two-armed randomized trial with a cluster design and delayed intervention for control churches. Our primary outcomes for this study will be changes in health behaviors (diet, physical activity) and movement along the transtheoretical model stages of change for tobacco use. Secondary outcomes will include changes in body mass index (BMI) and changes in self-efficacy and self-esteem. We will conduct process assessments to determine the level of feasibility in the development and delivery of the intervention materials. This model could be adapted for other American Indian churches as well as churches of other racial/ethnic groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The proposed project entitled The Native Proverbs 31 Health Project is in response to RFA-MD-10-004. The project is designed to develop, implement and evaluate a church-based CVD prevention program among Lumbee Indian women in Robeson County, NC.

"TRACE-CORE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), the usual reason for hospitalization of patients with coronary heart disease, is common and high-risk. Despite remarkable advances in the management of ACS in recent decades, unrealized health gains remain from underuse of available evidence for post-ACS patients. The proposed Transitions, Risks, and Actions in Coronary Events Center for Outcomes Research and Education (TRACE-CORE) will recruit a new longitudinal cohort of post-ACS patients, conduct two research projects using the cohort, and develop the careers of four early stage investigators (ESIs). We have 4 specific aims. 1) We will recruit and follow for 2 years a COHORT of 2,500 individuals, age 21-I-, 18% African-American and 10% Hispanic, at the time of their discharge from an ACS hospitalization at 8 medical centers in Massachusetts and Georgia. We will abstract medical records from the index and subsequent hospitalizations and outpatient records. Patient interviews at the time of discharge and at 2 and 6 weeks, and 3, 12, and 24 months later will include measurements of quality of life (QoL), cognitive impairment, adherence to medications, and health related behaviors. 2) TRANSITIONS PROJECT: We will characterize the 90-day transition process for patients discharged after an ACS. We will engage a national panel to develop an evidence-based Transition Measurement Set reflecting the first 90 days after discharge and going beyond existing systems that focus on the discharge process. We will test hypotheses on the associations between quality of care and outcomes (including rehospitalization and QoL), particularly as they pertain to health disparities. 3) ACTION SCORES PROJECT: We will develop and validate two novel ""Action Scores"" that predict clinical events/mortality and QoL and which emphasize modifiable aspects of health care delivery and patient behaviors. 4) Using TRACE-CORE as a training laboratory, we will develop the CVD outcomes research careers of the four ESIs. This will include structured mentoring, key involvement of the ESIs astheco-PIs in the research projects, and preparation of new research proposals based on the TRACE-CORE infrastructure and findings. Our team involves prominent CVD outcomes researchers, methodologists, cardiologists, and other clinicians. Our innovative Action Scores should activate patients and providers to improve CVD outcomes; our Transitions Project will fill important knowledge gaps. Future studies will benefit from our data, infrastructure, Action Scores, and transition measures; building on these will also underpin the careers of future CVD outcomes researchers.             ",TRACE-CORE,8016768,U01HL105268,"['health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Commit ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Consent ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cognitive ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Preparation ', ' Process ', ' Coronary ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Future ', ' Age ', ' base ', ' career ', ' rural area ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Teaching Hospitals ', ' Clinical ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Interview ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Individual ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Measurement ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Respondent ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' Patients ', ' Staging ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Consensus ', ' Knowledge ', ' Shortness of Breath ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' interest ', ' Visit ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' professor ', ' cohort ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Measures ', ' abstracting ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Process Measure ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Modeling ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' prototype ', ' high risk ', ' evidence base ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2010,1536126,0.09266901494791353
"Enhancing Delivery of Cardiovascular Disease Preventive Care in Ethnic Minority W    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death among women in the US, yet many women still have inadequate knowledge about CVD and its risk factors, and most underestimate their own risk. Misperceptions and low awareness of CVD have are particularly more common among Black and Hispanic women who have disproportionately worse outcomes from CVD. This likely impedes preventive efforts and adoption of healthy lifestyles. CVD prevention interventions that take advantage of missed opportunities and times of increased patient motivation are needed. The aims of this research proposal are 1) To assess levels of awareness, knowledge, perceptions, and reported previous preventive CVD education and correlation to levels of physical activity and CVD risk factors in a cohort of black and Hispanic women presenting for cardiac stress testing with the hypotheses that awareness and knowledge of CVD is low, few have previously received preventive education, and low levels of awareness correlate to lower physical activity and worse CVD risk factors; and 2) To conduct a pilot randomized controlled intervention study begun at the time of presentation for diagnostic stress testing that provides CVD prevention and lifestyle education and prevention-related stress test feedback to black and Hispanic women and their referring providers, with the hypothesis that it will improve patient CVD knowledge and awareness and foster more physically active lifestyles compared to usual care. The candidate, Dr. Camille Pearte, is a cardiologist and Assistant Professor of Medicine at New York University with a demonstrated history of dedication and commitment to research. Her objective is a successful career as an independent clinical investigator in the field of CVD prevention and health services with a special emphasis on underserved understudied populations. Under guidance and mentorship of a team of established investigators, she will undertake a thorough multidisciplinary career development plan that integrates a structured comprehensive didactic curriculum, and this research in CVD Prevention that aligns perfectly with her clinical work, will enable her to develop many of the skills necessary to achieve her career goals.       RELEVANCE (See instructions): Results of this research would have the potential to inform the design of future approaches for CVD preventive care that can be easily implemented and expanded into common clinical and public practice to assist in important public health efforts to improve care provided to underserved high-risk ethnic minority populations, reduce obesity, CVD risk and outcomes and ultimately reduce health disparities in these highrisk populations.

"ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes have been observed across ethnic and gender groups which are not fully explained by consideration of traditional and novel CVD risk factors. For example, African Americans have a considerably higher prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure than Caucasians despite lipid patterns and coronary artery calcium levels that generally show relatively favorable distributions. However, only limited research has addressed the role of sleep disorders in influencing CVD in ethnic minorities despite evidence that sleep disorders disproportionately affect minority populations and, through pro-inflammatory or autonomic nervous system dysregulation, operate as risk factors for hypertension and CVD. In this proposed ancillary study to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we aim to perform standardized in-home polysomnography and 7-day wrist actigraphy in 2500 African American, Hispanic, Asian American and Caucasian individuals participating in MESA Exam 5 to derive indices of sleep apnea, quality, duration and timing. Newly collected sleep data will be rigorously standardized and comprehensively analyzed by a central Reading Center. By capitalizing on the rich clinical, physiological, anthropomorphic, and biochemical data collected longitudinally by MESA over 10 years, we will test the associations between indices of sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index, nocturnal hypoxemia), sleep duration and quality, slow wave activity, and circadian placement with the indices of CVD risk, subclinical CVD and clinical CVD as outcomes. Finally, we will quantify the extent to which sleep disorders and patterns account for previously observed variations in CVD among ethnic and sex groups. By defining the role of sleep disorders in CVD in ethnic minorities, these activities may direct future interventions directed at reducing ethnic disparities in chronic health conditions.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed addition of objective measurements of sleep to MESA will fill an important gap in risk factor data in this unique cohort and allow the role of sleep disorders in atherosclerosis and CVD pathogenesis to be better defined, thus paving the way for important intervention studies that may improve health disparities in CVD.                          Project Narrative The proposed addition of objective measurements of sleep to MESA will fill an important gap in risk factor data in this unique cohort and allow the role of sleep disorders in atherosclerosis and CVD pathogenesis to be better defined, thus paving the way for important intervention studies that may improve health disparities in CVD.",ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS,7767538,R01HL098433,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' actigraphy ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Address ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' sex ', ' Polysomnography ', ' sleep polysomnography ', ' sleep measurement ', ' polysomnographic ', ' Somnography ', ' Sleep Monitoring ', ' Future ', ' Affect ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Biochemical ', ' indexing ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' Left Ventricular Dysfunction ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Reading ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Apnea ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Sleep ', ' Sleep Apnea Syndromes ', ' Sleep-Disordered Breathing ', ' Sleep Hypopnea ', ' Sleep Apnea ', ' Testing ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Time ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Caucasians ', ' Wrist ', ' Autonomic nervous system ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' cohort ', ' Calcium ', ' Factor IV ', ' Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Ca++ element ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor IV ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Gender ', ' Sleep Disorders ', ' sleep problem ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Circadian Rhythms ', ' diurnal variation ', ' daily biorhythm ', ' circadian process ', ' circadian ', ' Twenty-Four Hour Rhythm ', ' Nyctohemeral Rhythm ', ' Diurnal Rhythm ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Accounting ', ' nocturnal Hypoxemia ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NHLBI,BRIGHAM AND WOMEN'S HOSPITAL,R01,2010,2140244,0.139817641346711
"Disparities in CHD in the Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This K01 award will allow the candidate, Dr. Mario Sims, to gain the skills, knowledge and experience required to become an independent investigator in health disparities research. Using data from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), Dr. Sims will examine the extent to which neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) and key psychosocial factors (discrimination, stress, and social support) impact coronary heart disease (CHD) in African Americans in Mississippi. The JHS is the largest epidemiologic, population-based study of cardiovascular disease (CVD) among African Americans, and one of its primary aims - to develop young talented minority investigators in the field of CVD research - will be accomplished through this KO1 award. CHD is the leading cause of CVD mortality in America, and Mississippi has the highest overall CVD mortality rate in the nation. Moreover, the cardiovascular health disparity between African Americans and whites is widening. Mississippi's CHD mortality rate is higher than the U.S. rate. African Americans have higher CHD prevalence and mortality rates than whites, and they also have a higher prevalence of risk factors associated with CHD such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and obesity which clearly might influence the higher prevalence of CHD mortality. To achieve his research and career development goals, Dr. Sims will follow a career development plan at the University of Mississippi Medical Center, designed to provide knowledge, skills, and experience in 6 core competencies required to be a successful independent investigator in health disparities research: 1) research excellence in the area of CHD disparities, 2) advanced statistics and study design, 3) research ethics, 4) leadership and management, 5) presentation and teaching, and 6) scientific writing. This will be accomplished through implementation of an individualized learning plan that includes: 1) academic coursework to develop cardiovascular disease disparity research skills; 2) mentorship and consultation with nationally and internationally recognized experts in cardiovascular disease epidemiology and health disparities research; 3) mentorship by faculty sensitive to the unique needs and issues facing minority academic faculty; and 4) innovative research using a multi-dimensional framework for examining how CHD prevalence among African Americans is influence by neighborhood environments, perceived discrimination, stress, and social support. The proposed mentored research has three specific aims: 1) to examine the extent to which neighborhood SES is associated with CHD among African Americans; 2) to determine the degree to which perceived racial discrimination, stress and social support are associated with CHD among African Americans; and 3) to analyze the extent to which the association of neighborhood SES and CHD is mediated by psychosocial factors among African Americans. This is the first study of its kind to examine multiple pathways by which neighborhood SES and key psychosocial factors impact CHD risk in African Americans in Mississippi, a state with the highest CHD rate in the nation. This research will enable health-care providers to adequately serve their patients with CHD knowing that where they live and their exposure to discrimination, stress, and a lack of social support are sequelae to CHD. This research will also show which factors health policy makers need to focus on in order to address and eliminate CHD disparities.

"CULTURAL FACTORS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK IN MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Substantial research indicates that Mexican Americans are excessively vulnerable to the metabolic syndrome, with recent studies reporting metabolic syndrome prevalence rates of 30% or higher in this population. Because of the modifiable nature of the underlying causes of the metabolic syndrome and its strong association with cardiovascular disease (CVD), a better understanding of why Mexican Americans are predisposed to this condition is essential in any attempt to eliminate current CVD risk disparities in this population. The long-term goal of this research proposal is to contribute to the literature on CVD disparities in this at-risk population and to assist in the effort to eliminate such disparities. Toward this goal, the proposed research will examine the degree to which culturally-relevant variables represent risk and resilient factors for the metabolic syndrome. First, exploratory analyses will be conducted to examine: a) the nature and distributions of cultural characteristics considered potentially relevant to disease risk and resilience, including acculturation, familism, fatalism, and religiosity, and their co-variation and associations with sociodemographic characteristics; b) the relationship between cultural characteristics and behavioral risk factors relevant to the metabolic syndrome (i.e., dietary factors; physical activity); c) the relationship between cultural characteristics and metabolic syndrome indicators; and d) whether behavioral factors help explain   (i.e., ""mediate"") the relationship between cultural characteristics and metabolic syndrome variables. The training goals and research aims of the proposed plan will be accomplished in the context of two studies. The first study will examine archival data from a pilot project (South San Diego Women's Health Study; PI: L.C. Gallo; N=146) that served as the foundation for a study of the role of stress, psychosocial resources, and emotional factors in SES and ethnic CVD disparities in middle aged Mexican American women (Cardiovascular Risk Disparities: Socioemotional Pathways; PI: L. C. Gallo; N = 200). The second study will be used to conduct a comprehensive examination of the proposed cultural framework. A more inclusive understanding of the relevance of acculturation and Mexican cultural characteristics can help preserve any potential resiliency that exists and/or contribute to culturally sensitive approaches to risk prevention and intervention in this population.                   ",CULTURAL FACTORS AND METABOLIC SYNDROME RISK IN MEXICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN,7807960,F31HL087732,"['Cultural Characteristics ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Data ', ' Dietary Factors ', ' National Research Service Awards ', ' NRSA ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Behavioral ', ' Foundations ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' In-Migration ', ' Immigrations ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' Literature ', ' Mexican ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Mexican Americans ', ' Chicanos ', ' Chicanas ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Nature ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Training Activity ', ' Triglycerides ', ' Triacylglycerol ', ' Diastolic blood pressure ', ' Diastolic Pressure ', ' Woman ', ' waist circumference ', ' Behavior ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' resilience ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' emotional factor ', ' ']",NHLBI,SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY,F31,2010,13556,0.092179239808787
"Addressing Diabetes/CVD Health Disparities among American Indians: A Transdiscipl    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) are at increased risk for Type 2 diabetes when compared to other Americans, a gap that continues to widen. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has become the number one cause of death among AI/ANs, is now more common among AI/ANs than others in the U.S. general population, and is increasing not only in prevalence but also in associated mortality. The greatest risk factor for CVD in AI/ANs is diabetes. Both CVD and diabetes share common risk factors, such as weight and lipid levels, which in turn are strongly related to diet and exercise behaviors. Effective preventive interventions focused on these behaviors hold promise for diminishing the diabetes and CVD disparities AI/ANs face. We propose to use the unique opportunity provided by the NCMHD's Social Determinants of Health Initiative (as part of RFA-OD-09-004) to assess the viability and sustainability of an intervention that makes accessible 2 electronic tools: 1) one for increasing exercise and 2) one for tracking diet and exercise among overweight/obese AI/ANs living in 2 urban areas. This work has 3 aims: 1) To determine whether introduction of 2 electronic devices leads to decreased risk for diabetes and CVD among overweight/obese AI/ANs; 2) To assess the social determinants of resultant changes in diabetes and CVD risk using sociobehavioral theories; and 3) To place the investigations of effectiveness (aims 1 and 2) in a larger translational framework by exploring aspects of reach, adoption, and implementation in order to understand issues of viability and sustainability of this and comparable interventions. This study will take place with 2 Indian Health Service-funded urban Indian clinic populations (Denver and Albuquerque) and be completed by a transdisciplinary team from the Centers for American Indian and Alaska Native Health within the Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado Denver. The placement of this work within larger theoretical frameworks, as well as the focus on diabetes and CVD (diseases becoming more common among many Americans); renders this work for broad public health significance. We are experiencing a nationwide epidemic of overweight and obesity, with concomitant increases in diabetes, CVD, and other conditions. Health disparity populations, including American Indians and Alaska Natives; especially those who are unemployed, underemployed, or otherwise facing financial stress are even less likely to maintain healthy exercise and dietary habits. As we consider the health implications of the current recession, the importance of developing intervention methods which address possible decreases in exercise and healthy diet nationally due to increased financial stress is accentuated. To seize the opportunity do so in a way that allows the expansion of our theoretical understandings of behavior change is extraordinary.               We are experiencing a nationwide epidemic of overweight and obesity, with concomitant increases in diabetes, CVD, and other conditions.

"GENE/DIET EFFECTS ON PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the US and their risks are determined by non-modifiable (i.e., genetic) and modifiable factors (i.e., plasma lipid levels). It is well established that low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) are associated with increased CVD risk. A key determinant of HDL metabolism is hepatic lipase (HL), an enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of triglycerides and phospholipids in lipoproteins. Within the hepatic lipase (LIPC) gene at position -514 exists a common C/T polymorphism. The -514TT genotype is associated with an approximate 40% decrease in HL activity and increased HDL-C levels. However, this effect is variable among populations, suggesting gene- environment interactions. One of this grant's earlier key findings is that the -514 polymorphism shows a statistically significant interaction between HDL-C levels and dietary fat intake in Whites. Moreover, we replicated the findings in an Asian population. What remains to be demonstrated is whether these interactions occur when subjects modify their dietary fat intake and if so, what mechanisms are involved. Thus, the primary goal of this proposal is to use an interventional setting to thoroughly evaluate interactions between LIPC gene variants, changes in dietary fat intake and plasma lipid levels, inflammation markers and endothelial function. Moreover, we hypothesize that minorities, such as Hispanics, due to the enrichment of the -514 T allele (approximately 0.36) are more susceptible to the effects of these gene-diet interactions. Hence, we propose a randomized, cross over, two-phase diet intervention aimed at assessing the impact of consuming different levels of dietary fat (15% and 37%, respectively, 6 weeks each) on plasma HDL related measures in Caribbean Hispanic subjects (n=80; 40 CC and 40 TT). Our main hypothesis is that CC subjects respond to increases in the % of energy consumed as fat with increases in HDL-C levels. Conversely, in TT subjects, such dietary change results in decreases in HDL-C levels and worsening of endothelial function. Therefore, T subjects will have an elevated CVD risk when consuming high fat diets. Moreover, given the high frequency of the T allele in Hispanics, this interaction could account for some of the increase in CVD risk seen after acculturation. This evidence-based knowledge will contribute to a rational approach toward more effective dietary recommendations aimed to decrease health disparities and to a better CVD prevention.           ",GENE/DIET EFFECTS ON PLASMA LIPOPROTEIN LEVELS,7893170,R01HL054776,"['Genetic Crossing Over ', ' nonsister chromatid exchange ', ' Crossing Over ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Diet ', ' Dietary Fats ', ' dietary lipid ', ' Address ', ' Enzymes ', ' phosphatidylethanolamine ', ' O-(1-beta-acyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho)-ethanolamine ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Data ', ' Degradation Pathway ', ' Degradative Pathway ', ' Intake ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Subgroup ', ' in vivo ', ' Observational Study ', ' Phospholipid Degradation Pathway ', ' Phospholipid Degradation ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Characteristics ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Exhibits ', ' Behavioral ', ' Fasting ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty Acids ', ' Female ', ' Food ', ' Affect ', ' Gene Frequency ', ' allelic frequency ', ' Allele Frequency ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Genotype ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' improved ', ' Health ', ' Hydrolysis ', ' Peripheral ', ' Phase ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Interleukin-1 beta ', ' Preinterleukin 1 Beta ', ' Interleukin 1beta ', ' IL1F2 ', ' IL1B Protein ', ' IL1-Beta ', ' IL-1-b ', ' IL-1 beta ', ' Beta Proprotein Interleukin 1 ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Chemicals ', ' Stimulus ', ' Individual ', ' Lipids ', ' Lipoproteins ', ' High Density Lipoproteins ', ' alpha-Lipoproteins ', ' High density lipoprotein ', ' Heavy Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Lipoproteins ', ' HDL ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' Low-Density Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoproteins ', ' LDL Lipoproteins ', ' LDL ', ' Food Interactions ', ' nutrient interaction ', ' Lysophosphatidylcholines ', ' Lysolecithins ', ' anakinra ', ' urine-derived IL1 inhibitor ', ' urine interleukin 1 inhibitor ', ' urine IL-1 inhibitor ', ' interleukin 1 receptor antagonist protein ', ' Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist ', ' IL1RN ', ' IL1 febrile inhibitor ', ' IL-1ra ', ' male ', ' Metabolism ', ' Metabolic Processes ', ' Intermediary Metabolism ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Morbidity -

"Racial Differences in Atherosclerosis, Plaque Vulnerability, and CVD Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States. Blacks are affected disproportionately by CVD; age-adjusted coronary heart disease death rates are 29% higher for blacks than for whites. This disparity in risk is only partially explained by racial differences in prevalences of traditional and emerging CVD risk factors. Despite having higher rates of CVD, blacks are less likely than whites to have severe obstructive coronary artery atherosclerosis and coronary artery calcium. This observation is counterintuitive; the less diffuse coronary artery calcification and obstruction observed in blacks would be expected to be associated with a lower prevalence of CVD risk factors and a lower incidence of CVD events, neither of which is observed. In the face of these inconsistencies, we hypothesize that as compared to whites, blacks are more likely to develop vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques that are associated with acute CVD. Our preliminary investigations support this hypothesis by demonstrating that black race is independently associated with less calcified coronary artery plaques, greater positive arterial remodeling, and more endothelial dysfunction. Racial differences in these arterial characteristics, which are associated with increased plaque vulnerability, may be explained by our observations which indicate that blacks have higher levels of circulating modulators of plaque vulnerability. Therefore, the goal of the proposed study is to prospectively investigate race-related differences in the pathophysiology of atherosclerotic plaques in our extensively characterized cohort of 2,000 subjects (43% black) in our Heart SCORE study that has collected a wealth of biological data and plasma over a follow-up period of 6 years. This proposal will compare the prevalence of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque between blacks and whites who are enrolled in Heart SCORE by using microbubble contrast-enhanced B-mode ultrasonography to quantify carotid artery adventitial vasa vasorum density, which correlates with plaque vulnerability, and to accurately measure intimal-medial thickness of both the far and near walls of the carotid artery (cIMT). The proposed study will also evaluate race-related differences in distributions of modulators of plaque vulnerability, such as inflammatory mediators, matrix metalloproteinases, and markers of endothelial cell activation, and in the predictive value of these modulators for long-term risk of adverse CVD events. Moreover, the study will assess the predictive values of vasa vasorum density and modulators of plaque vulnerability for cIMT (including by race). We anticipate that our findings will demonstrate a link between race, vasa vasorum density, atherosclerosis modulators, and CVD outcome.

"Can CHW/PS Promote Lifestyle and Environment Changes to Reduce CVD Risk in Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HEART (Heath Education Assessment Research Team) Phase 2 is a community-based participatory research continuation project whose overall goal is to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Hispanics in El Paso, Texas using the community health workers/promotores de salud (CHW/PS) model. In HEART Phase 1 we: 1) developed a Community Health Advisory Committee (CHAC) to lead the participatory research process and guide additional means to obtain community input; 2) performed a community needs assessment to direct the research process; and 3) conducted a four-month CHW7PS pilot intervention (group classes and follow-up) to identify an optimal CHW/PS outreach approach. In addition to the lifestyle changes promoted in our pilot study, the HEART Phase 2 will add a fitness component and include a focus on the environment that contributes to CVD risk. Two new community partners have been added to emphasize our fitness and environmental approach: the YWCA facility in the Lower Valley and after-school programs available at both the YWCA and through the City of El Paso Parks and Recreation Department. We plan to foster the sustained integration of the CHW/PS model in these new community based organizations (CBOs) and public sector settings through increased organizational experience and knowledge regarding culturally-tailored lifestyle and environmental interventions. Most importantly, we will conduct an intervention in the Lower Valley of Et Paso that will build on our pilot study. Our culturally sensitive programming will be known as Mi Corazon, Mi Comunidad (My Heart, My Community). The goals of the intervention will be to 1) increase awareness and utilization of programs by Hispanic families living in the target community; 2) increase health behaviors including intentions and self-efficacy, and 3) decrease CVD risk factors among Hispanic families. Through our combined approach and with the continuous input from the CHAC, we will impact change agents, stakeholders, organizations, individuals and families. Lastly, we will define and promote a policy agenda that targets integration of CHW/PS in CBOs and public sector programs in conjunction with a dissemination plan to share our findings with a broader audience, thereby improving lifestyle and environmental factors that impact CVD risk factors for Hispanics in El Paso, Texas.          ",Can CHW/PS Promote Lifestyle and Environment Changes to Reduce CVD Risk in Texas,7799088,R24MD001785,"['cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Address ', ' fitness ', ' Process ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' Family ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' Goals ', ' improved ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Policies ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Sector ', ' Recreation ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Texas ', ' Awareness ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Behavior ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' experience ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' outreach ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' after-school program ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Modeling ', ' Cities ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Communities ', ' environmental change ', ' environmental intervention ', ' community organizations ', ' community based participatory research ', ' service utilization ', ' group intervention ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R24,2010,525350,0.12143989664171076
"Gender Disparities in Invasive CVD Procedure Use: the Role of Provider Bias    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  My long-term career goal is to become a nationally recognized independent investigator and expert in  cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities with an emphasis on interventions designed to eliminate disparities. I  have laid a strong foundation for reaching this goal by defining a broad mentoring network, obtaining formal  training in health services research, and leading several research projects. To date, my research has primarily focused on describing gender disparities in CVD care. For example, I have shown that women with CVD receive fewer invasive procedures than men with CVD. Despite extensive research documenting these disparities, few have investigated their causes. I am committing my career to addressing this gap by conducting research aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind gender disparities to achieve my ultimate goal of instituting evidence-based interventions to reduce gender disparities in CVD care.  The Institute of Medicine has identified provider bias as a key contributor to disparities in health care. However, the role of provider bias in gender-based decisions surrounding the use of invasive CVD procedures is poorly characterized. In order to more accurately and fully measure provider attitudes, advanced qualitative and social psychology techniques must be employed; skills I wish to develop. Therefore, I seek a Career Development Award to allow me time and support to pursue mentored research aimed at measuring provider gender attitudes and training in the areas of qualitative research, social psychology and advanced biostatistical techniques. The proposed research and training are a crucial to move my research forward from defining gender disparities towards research aimed at understanding the causes of these disparities.  Although studies have implicated provider bias as the cause of gender disparities in CVD care, to our knowledge, no study has directly measured such attitudes using validated instruments. Tools have been developed in other fields that measure implicit (unconscious) gender attitudes such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). These tools have been widely used to explain gender differences in social outcomes including job promotions and performance evaluations, but they have not been widely applied to the study of health care disparities. Furthermore, these tools may need to be adapted to capture concepts specific to CVD care, such as a provider's belief about women's willingness to undergo invasive procedures or whether a provider views women as fragile and therefore more likely to have a complication from an invasive procedure. This gap in knowledge is a barrier to developing evidence-based interventions to address gender disparities.  The research objectives of this Career Development Award are to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes to apply to decisions concerning the use of invasive CVD procedures and to conduct preliminary tests of these adapted measures. The research will occur in three steps. For aim 1, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with cardiologists, using two case scenarios in which an invasive cardiac procedure might be recommended.  These interviews will be used to determine providers' gender attitudes specific to invasive cardiac procedures, and the results will then be used to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes. Next, in aim 2, I will test the adapted measures within a second cohort of cardiologists to determine the relationship between measured attitudes and the providers' decision to use an invasive cardiac procedure with women and men in the standard case scenarios. Finally, in aim 3, I will conduct a study to test my ability to link the adapted measures results and the subject cardiologists' actual clinical decisions obtained from retrospective clinical data.  As a health services researcher, woman and practicing cardiologist, I am uniquely positioned to make important contributions to the field of gender disparities and CVD. I will bridge the fields of social psychology and health services research in order to gain a better understanding of potential contributors to gender disparities and plan for multimodal interventions aimed at reducing or eliminating disparities in CVD care. My extensive methodological training, research experience and proposed training activities make me ideally positioned to perform the proposed studies. Furthermore, the unique resources available at the University of Colorado Denver and its affiliated campuses will ensure my success towards these goals. Specifically, my mentorship team includes experts in health services and disparities research (Drs. Masoudi, Havranek, and Blair), measurement of explicit and implicit bias using social psychology experimental procedures (Dr. Blair), adaption of survey tools based on qualitative techniques (Dr. Main) and advanced hierarchical modeling (Dr.  Dickinson).

"Center for Reduce CVD Disparities: Genes, Clinics, and Communities Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affect low income and minority populations. Lenoir County, North Carolina is among the poorest in the state and situated in the ""stroke belt"" with significantly elevated heart disease, stroke, and obesity rates relative to state levels already well above the national average. At the same time, this county is home to many clinical and public health efforts on which to build. We propose an integrated set of three interdisciplinary studies in Lenoir County to: 1) determine genetic factors associated with CVD risk; 2) understand the multilevel determinants of poor health outcomes and the potential social and community capital that can support sustainable change; 3) work with community leaders, health professionals, and citizens to apply these understandings to improved practice-based management of hypertension and community-centered lifestyle management, and test the impact on improving outcomes and reducing disparities in cardiovascular health among 700 participants. This will include an innovative partnership with a nonprofit call center, Connect Inc, adding a lifestyle and medication adherence coaching component to their current focus on jobs, employment, and benefits counseling; 4) test the impact, reach, adoption, and sustainability of clinical, community-level, and policy interventions , including economic development potential; and 5) develop and implement strategies for translation and dissemination of the clinic-based and community-level interventions to other underserved regions. This work will be supported by an administrative core housed in the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (a CDC funded Prevention Research Center with a focus on community-based participatory research). Additional cores include: 1) a Genomic Bioinformatics Core available to this project and other PSO programs to analyze genetic/genomic data and other pathways of interest; and 2) a Social Determinants/Economic Development/Dissemination Core to understand the interface between poverty and health, and explore strategies with the potential to create jobs while promoting health. Additional core support for data collection, community engagement, and economic development will be leveraged through the UNC CTSA (NC TraCS) and the Community-Campus Partnership for Tomorrow, which is the result of a statewide assessment led to the President of the UNC (16 campus) system to ""to produce a more proactively responsive University focused on meeting the challenges of the state over the next 20 years.""

"Mentoring in community influences on CVD risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a proposal for a midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research. This career development award will give Dr. Corbie-Smith the dedicated time to focus on patient-oriented research in cardiovascular disease prevention, and recruit and mentor some of the brightest young scientists at UNC into healthcare disparities research. Her immediate career objectives are: 1) To extend her work in engaging communities of color in research by developing interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease that address patients in the context of their communities; 2) To understand the influence of community factors in underserved communities and their impact on healthcare utilization and health outcomes in cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors; and 3) To provide outstanding mentorship by creating a training environment that supports the conduct of high impact research in cardiovascular prevention and outcomes. The specific aims for the new research to be supported through this K24 Midcareer Investigator award include 1) Determine the feasibility of training a current cohort of community health advisors as navigators to link residents with multiple cardiovascular risk factors to local healthcare systems; 2) Determine the impact of navigators on cardiovascular risk factor control (HgbA1C, physical activity, BP control, smoking) and access to care for community members at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; 3) Identify community and social factors that influence cardiovascular risk factor control and outcomes. This two-arm trial will investigate the role of navigators on cardiovascular outcomes in community based outreach programs to improve access and utilization of medical services. Two to three navigators at each of the four sites will be utilized. Patients will be randomized to either a navigator intervention or to usual patient management practices, with measurement at baseline and six months. This study targets a disease condition and population of significant importance - CVD risk factor prevention in rural African Americans - and extends an existing effective model in several important ways. This study situates the navigator and patient within the community (rather than the healthcare system) thus increasing the cultural relevance of the intervention. Rather than a focus on one condition, navigators will support access and management of several chronic conditions, thus addressing the reality of multiple co-morbidities in underserved patients. Lastly, augmenting patient data with community variables allows a comprehensive analysis of external influence on cardiovascular disease prevention and healthcare utilization.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will advance public health by testing a patient navigator program to improve access to and quality of care for those with heart disease risk factors.

"The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Significant disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, prevalence, and health outcomes persist among racial and ethnic minorities, and those with lower socioeconomic status (SES). Although Healthy People 2010 (HP) and national clinical guidelines endorse lifestyle change for preventing and reducing CVD prevalence, numerous barriers limit health behavior change in many minority and low-income communities. New risk reduction strategies are needed using community-based participatory research (CBPR) techniques, which allow researchers and communities to combine their efforts promoting health, preventing disease, and reducing health disparities. Collaborative strategies must move beyond investigating behavior change alone and begin focusing on behavior change maintenance. The GoodNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, and Wellness and Spiritual Growth) Trial is an 18-month effectiveness trial with an 18-month extended maintenance study, among 20 African-American and low- income congregations participating in the GoodNEWS faith-based lay health promotion program. After training, congregations will be randomized to either GoodNEWS with a health maintenance intervention (GoodNEWS-l) or GoodNEWS program alone (GoodNEWS-PA). The maintenance intervention combines elements of the medical care model and features of community-based support. Primary data collection will occur at baseline, 18, and 36 months with the two primary outcomes being levels of physical activity as measured by 7- Day Physical Activity Recall (PAR) and dietary change as measured by the Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ). The primary hypothesis is that the maintenance group will significantly increase physical activity and healthy eating behavior compared to the program only group. We also hypothesize that lipoprotein and glucose levels, and blood pressure will be significantly improved over baseline in the GoodNEWS-l group and that these changes will be significantly greater than in the GoodNEWS-PA group. At the end of the trial, both groups will continue in an 18-month extended maintenance study. Relevance to Public Health: The GoodNEWS Trial is consistent with the Healthy People 2010 goal of eliminating health disparities. Lifestyle change is an important strategy for reducing CVD prevalence in high- risk populations. The proposed study will contribute to greater understanding of community-based health promotion and primary prevention strategies for reducing risk factors for heart disease and stroke in these populations, and maintaining lifestyle and behavior change over time.             ","The GOODNEWS (Genes, Nutrition, Exercise, Wellness, and Spiritual Growth) Trial",8139863,R01HL087768,"['Healthy

"The Native Proverbs 31 Health Project    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) rates have increased dramatically among American Indians in recent years. Modifiable CVD risk factors, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, sedentary behavior, and tobacco use are generally higher in most American Indian communities compared to non-Hispanic whites, although there is limited understanding of the unique cultural aspects of appropriate CVD primary prevention strategies in these populations. The Lumbee Indian tribe, a non-reservation tribe with a population of about 50,000, is the largest American Indian tribe east of the Mississippi River, and is largely concentrated in Robeson County, in southeastern North Carolina (NC). This county is largely rural, has a high poverty rate, and is almost equally divided among American Indians, African Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Limited available data indicate that CVD and its risk factors are very high among American Indians in North Carolina in general and Lumbees in particular. The Lumbee tribe is largely Christian, and the church is a very important component of Lumbee culture, providing opportunities to develop church-based health interventions in this population. The proposed project, entitled, ""The Native Proverbs 31 Health Project,"" is in response to RFA-MD-10-004 (NCMHD Innovative Faith-based Approaches to Health Disparities Research). This project is designed to develop, implement and evaluate a CVD prevention program among Lumbee Indian women in Robeson County, NC, focusing on the biblical messages in Proverbs 31. The following aims will be performed 1) Based on prior research and formative work in the community, collaboratively develop a community-based, culturally appropriate CVD intervention program for Lumbee Indian women in Robeson County, NC, focusing on the health-related messages in biblical passage in Proverbs 31; 2) Implement a 6-month CVD intervention program in four Lumbee Indian churches in Robeson County, NC, using a community health / lay health educator model. 3) Evaluate the community-based, culturally appropriate CVD intervention program on diet, physical activity and tobacco use among Lumbee women using a two-armed randomized trial with a cluster design and delayed intervention for control churches. Our primary outcomes for this study will be changes in health behaviors (diet, physical activity) and movement along the transtheoretical model stages of change for tobacco use. Secondary outcomes will include changes in body mass index (BMI) and changes in self-efficacy and self-esteem. We will conduct process assessments to determine the level of feasibility in the development and delivery of the intervention materials. This model could be adapted for other American Indian churches as well as churches of other racial/ethnic groups.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative The proposed project entitled The Native Proverbs 31 Health Project is in response to RFA-MD-10-004.

"Weight, Diet, Genes and CVD Risk Factors (Hypertension and Diabetes)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the world (1- 3). Hypertension and diabetes, two of the major CVD risk factors, are complex diseases caused by the combined actions of genetic and environmental factors (4-8). Few studies have examined the interaction of these factors and fewer, if any, have looked at their effects in populations of developing Asian countries that are plagued with increasing levels of obesity and rapidly changing food environments (9, 10). The information gap may be due to the lack of population-based studies with adequate depth and detail. There is a paucity of information on dietary and adiposity trends derived from longitudinal studies and there are inadequate genetic data, especially among Asians who tend to develop CVD risk factors at lower body mass index thresholds (11, 12). Aims and Methods: The proposed study aims to understand how weight history, dietary patterns, and genetic variants independently and jointly affect blood pressure and fasting glucose among adult Filipino women (ages 38 to 71 yr in 2007) using the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (CLHNS), an ongoing community-based study of over 2000 women (and their infants) which began in 1983. This is a unique dataset that contains not only rich genetic information on these women but also dietary and anthropometric measurements obtained since baseline, recent blood pressure (1998-2007) and fasting glucose (2005) measurements, and other individual-, household-, and community-level data collected over a span of 24 years of rapid country-wide socio-economic changes. Specifically, using multivariate regression methods we will determine the: (a) effect of weight history (i.e. duration of overweight) on the risk of having hypertension and/or diabetes; (b) association between dietary patterns (identified through cluster analysis) and hypertension and/or diabetes; (c) independence and co-occurrence of hypertension and diabetes and how these relate to weight and dietary patterns; and (d) effects of genetic variants on hypertension and diabetes, focusing on gene variants that have been associated with hypertension or diabetes by previous association studies. Further, the study will explore significant interaction of effects among genetic variants, overweight history and dietary patterns in affecting hypertension or diabetes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study will examine the independent and combined effects of genetic predisposition and modifiable factors such as weight and dietary patterns on the risks of having hypertension and diabetes, two major cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The demographic and health trends in the Philippines exemplify those of other developing Asian countries where CVD-related morbidities and deaths are prevalent and increasing.

"Assessing Biological Pathways: Linking Neighborhoods to Cardiovascular Mortality    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A growing number of studies report gender differences in how the neighborhood environment impacts individual health behaviors, health status, and/or mortality. Although research in this domain has made great strides, researchers are still in the early stages of identifying the biological pathways through which neighborhood characteristics actually ""get under the skin,"" and the Institute of Medicine's (IOM) call for gender- based analyses has not been fulfilled. More specifically, research to date has lacked the necessary combination of data on individual-level sociodemographic, health behavior and biological markers, objective neighborhood data, and follow-up data on individual mortality. Also, there is a dearth of work systematically assessing gender differences in the association of neighborhood factors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in the United States. We propose to address this gap in the literature by assessing biological pathways between key aspects of the residential environment and CVD mortality in a national sample of adults. The specific aims of this proposed research are to: 1. Assess the relationship between selected characteristics of the neighborhood environment (i.e., neighborhood socioeconomic status (NSES), population density, and residential stability) and acquired biological risk factors for CVD and examine whether these relationships differ by gender, controlling for key individual-level health behavior and sociodemographic characteristics. 2. Assess the relationship between acquired biological risk factors for CVD and subsequent CVD mortality, and examine whether they differ by gender, controlling for key individual-level health behavior and sociodemographic characteristics. 3. Assess the role of acquired biological risk factors for CVD as mediating pathways between the selected characteristics of the neighborhood environment and CVD mortality, and examine how their role may differ by gender, controlling for key individual-level health behavior and sociodemographic characteristics. The proposed project will draw on integrated data from five major sources: (1) Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), (2) the NHANES 1999-2004; (3) United States Census; (4) RAND Center for Population Health and Health Disparities (CPHHD) Data Core; and (5) National Death Index (NDI). Biomarkers are available through the NHANES data, including both traditional and more recently identified predictors of CVD risk and mortality. Taken together, these data provide a unique opportunity to assess key pathways between neighborhood context and men's and women's CVD risk and subsequent mortality.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research focuses on aspects of the social and physical environment of neighborhoods interventions in the area of building, housing, and land-use policy could address. This work will shed light on how related public policy efforts and public health interventions, particularly in the area of cardiovascular health, could-in the long term-improve health behaviors, cardiovascular risk factors, and survival, as well as reduce health disparities.

"Pilot Testing the Signs of Health Intervention (SoHi)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to test the Signs of Health Intervention (SoHi) for feasibility and effectiveness in decreasing risk for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) among Deaf adults. Effective CVD prevention programs have been developed to target various vulnerable populations but very little has been done to address CVD prevention in the Deaf community. Culturally Deaf adults are people who experienced early, significant hearing loss (a physical disability) resulting in a natural affinity for visual language (American Sign Language: ASL), and identification with a distinct cultural and linguistic minority group. Culturally Deaf adults have limited access to health related information due mainly to communication barriers, and Deaf adults' socioeconomic status is generally much lower than that of the hearing society. Deaf adults are more often unemployed or underemployed than others, have a lower mean educational level than their hearing counterparts and limited literacy with most reading at the 3rd to 4th grade level. Health information is typically provided in spoken or written language; thus Deaf adults face daunting barriers to accessing health information. The combination of communication barriers, low income, and limited education with low health literacy, secondary disabilities, and membership in ethnic minority groups put Deaf community members at significant risk for CVD. The Signs of Health Intervention (SoHi) is an innovative community based theory- driven lifestyle intervention focused on overcoming health communications barriers to promote CVD risk reduction in the Deaf community. The SoHi was developed from the investigator's previous research. The curriculum consists of classroom and community components taught entirely in American Sign Language (ASL). To date no interventions have been designed and tested to reduce CVD risks in Deaf adults. Results of this study will be used for a multi-site clinical trial and serve as a prototype to deliver other health-related programs within the Deaf community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, disproportionately effecting ethnic minority and low income individuals.

"Boston Puerto Rican Health Study - CVD Risk Factors Puerto Rican adults living on the mainland US have documented health disparities; however, little research has been conducted with this second largest Hispanic subgroup. Our long-term goal is to understand the complex interactions of diet and other behavioral and environmental factors, genetics, and psychosocial stress on the high and apparently increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in Puerto Rican adults. As this group is rapidly growing, understanding the reasons for this risk is of great importance. Our initial funding period for the Boston Puerto Rican Center on Population Health and Health Disparities (BPR-CPHHD, 2003-08) focused on the role of stress on physical disability and cognitive decline, through physiological dysregulation or ""allostatic load."" During that investigation, it became clear that risk factors for CVD were highly prevalent. These findings are in contrast to the commonly held belief that there is a Hispanic paradox¿lower heart disease and mortality despite greater poverty. Importantly, the Puerto Rican population differs considerably in ancestral genetic history and in exposures to known risk factors from other Hispanic groups. They have unique dietary intake patterns, as well as social, cultural and environmental structures that contribute and affect reaction to stressors. During our initial funding period, we successfully assembled a cohort of 1450 Puerto Rican adults, aged 45-75 years at baseline, and have completed (to date) more than 900 two-year follow-up interviews¿we are continuing, with the expectation of completing at least 1150. As this population is aging and growing rapidly, the high prevalence and apparent cohort effect of increased heart disease risk factors suggest that 1) this population has serious health disparities in heart disease risk factors and 2) heart disease will become an even greater problem for this group in the near future. Our overall aim for this renewal is, therefore, to extend follow-up and to measure and analyze relevant characteristics and CVD risk factors, and to add additional contextual and outcome measures for CVD risk in this established cohort of Puerto Rican adults, so that we may better understand the dynamics of these disparities. Our model follows the transdisciplinary ""cells to society"" concept developed jointly with our partner CPHHDs during the initial funding period, with consideration of genetic variation in relation to longitudinal change in allostatic load and biochemical indicators of risk, to more concrete indicators of disease (ankle brachial index (ABI) and intima media thickness (IMT)); with additional focus on social networks, neighborhood characteristics (physical space and access to food) and environment (air pollution) factors as social determinants of health. Finally, using community based participatory techniques, we will implement and test a multidimensional intervention that focuses on diet and exercise, but that also fully considers the social and physical environment to ensure success. With participation of our community partner. La Alianza Hispana, and the support of our administrative, biostatistics and laboratory cores, our team is efficiently poised to make significant contributions to understanding the factors that contribute to the apparent growing threat of heart disease in this highly disadvantaged group¿while providing insights that may be useful to other vulnerable groups. The continuation of our cohort, with its rich constellation of measures, will allow us to unravel some of the complex etiologic interactions which contribute to CVD risk, so that effective interventions maybe implemented. This work takes the innovative and necessary approach of examining complex interactions of physiological measures, biological stress, and psychosocial evaluation on multiple levels to understand the causes of disproportionate health disparities in Puerto Ricans.

"Lifecourse SES and Cardiovascular Disease Risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research will take advantage of data that were collected as a part of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study (CARDIA), a longitudinal investigation of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in an adult community sample, to examine potential explanations for socioeconomic disparities in CVD. A major focus is to understand how changes in socioeconomic status (SES) over the lifecourse influence future CVD risk, and the extent to which the association between SES change and CVD risk is moderated by race/ethnicity and gender. Specifically, emphasis is placed on the possibility that psychosocial factors related to SES may influence future subclinical atherosclerotic burden by modulating processes thought to be related to CVD pathogenesis (blood pressure [BP] and chronic low grade inflammation and oxidative stress) via regulation of adrenal hormone activity. Emphasis also is placed on the possibility that changes in SES over the lifecourse may be paralleled by changes in health behaviors and that   the evolution of health behaviors over time might explain the association of SES with CVD risk factors. We take two different approaches to the analysis of lifecourse SES: we examine (a) trajectories of change in SES during young and middle adulthood; and (b) a total lifecourse model that incorporates measures of childhood SES. We also examine whether perceived social standing is associated with CVD risk factors, and whether this association explains the link between objective SES and CVD risk.   PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research will make a unique contribution to the study of SES disparities in CVD risk by employing a lifecourse approach that incorporates (a) analysis of change in SES trajectories across young and middle adulthood, (b) measures of childhood as well as adult SES, and (c) examination of whether the influence of SES factors on CVD risk differs according to race/ethnicity and gender. There are several reasons to take a lifecourse approach to the examination of SES disparities in CVD risk. First of all, being able to identify when during the lifecourse SES begins to influence CVD risk, and how the effects of early status combine with those of adult status to further influence risk will enhance our understanding of SES disparities in CVD. Second, revealing an association of lifecourse SES with subclinical atherosclerosis could have important clinical implications insofar as it would allow for identification and tracking of individuals who may be at elevated risk for clinical CVD at early points in the course of the disease that may be more responsive to early preventive treatment. Finally, revealing an association of lifecourse SES with biological and behavioral factors known to contribute to CVD pathogenesis will provide us with additional insight into mechanisms whereby relative socioeconomic disadvantage can be translated into cardiovascular pathology. Obtaining a fuller understanding of when and how socioeconomic factors influence CVD risk, and whether the nature and strength of this influence differs between Blacks and Whites and men and women, can have important implications for public health insofar as it will enable the development of targeted preventive strategies that ultimately can lessen the burden of CVD across the socioeconomic hierarchy.            Principal Investigator/Program Director (Last, First, Middle): Deverts, Denise, Janicki PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research will make a unique contribution to the study of SES disparities in CVD risk by employing a lifecourse approach that incorporates (a) analysis of change in SES trajectories across young and middle adulthood, (b) measures of childhood as well as adult SES, and (c) examination of whether the influence of SES factors on CVD risk differs according to race/ethnicity and gender.

"Gender Disparities in Invasive CVD Procedure Use: the Role of Provider Bias    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  My long-term career goal is to become a nationally recognized independent investigator and expert in  cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities with an emphasis on interventions designed to eliminate disparities. I  have laid a strong foundation for reaching this goal by defining a broad mentoring network, obtaining formal  training in health services research, and leading several research projects. To date, my research has primarily focused on describing gender disparities in CVD care. For example, I have shown that women with CVD receive fewer invasive procedures than men with CVD. Despite extensive research documenting these disparities, few have investigated their causes. I am committing my career to addressing this gap by conducting research aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind gender disparities to achieve my ultimate goal of instituting evidence-based interventions to reduce gender disparities in CVD care.  The Institute of Medicine has identified provider bias as a key contributor to disparities in health care. However, the role of provider bias in gender-based decisions surrounding the use of invasive CVD procedures is poorly characterized. In order to more accurately and fully measure provider attitudes, advanced qualitative and social psychology techniques must be employed; skills I wish to develop. Therefore, I seek a Career Development Award to allow me time and support to pursue mentored research aimed at measuring provider gender attitudes and training in the areas of qualitative research, social psychology and advanced biostatistical techniques. The proposed research and training are a crucial to move my research forward from defining gender disparities towards research aimed at understanding the causes of these disparities.  Although studies have implicated provider bias as the cause of gender disparities in CVD care, to our knowledge, no study has directly measured such attitudes using validated instruments. Tools have been developed in other fields that measure implicit (unconscious) gender attitudes such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). These tools have been widely used to explain gender differences in social outcomes including job promotions and performance evaluations, but they have not been widely applied to the study of health care disparities. Furthermore, these tools may need to be adapted to capture concepts specific to CVD care, such as a provider's belief about women's willingness to undergo invasive procedures or whether a provider views women as fragile and therefore more likely to have a complication from an invasive procedure. This gap in knowledge is a barrier to developing evidence-based interventions to address gender disparities.  The research objectives of this Career Development Award are to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes to apply to decisions concerning the use of invasive CVD procedures and to conduct preliminary tests of these adapted measures. The research will occur in three steps. For aim 1, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with cardiologists, using two case scenarios in which an invasive cardiac procedure might be recommended.  These interviews will be used to determine providers' gender attitudes specific to invasive cardiac procedures, and the results will then be used to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes. Next, in aim 2, I will test the adapted measures within a second cohort of cardiologists to determine the relationship between measured attitudes and the providers' decision to use an invasive cardiac procedure with women and men in the standard case scenarios. Finally, in aim 3, I will conduct a study to test my ability to link the adapted measures results and the subject cardiologists' actual clinical decisions obtained from retrospective clinical data.  As a health services researcher, woman and practicing cardiologist, I am uniquely positioned to make important contributions to the field of gender disparities and CVD. I will bridge the fields of social psychology and health services research in order to gain a better understanding of potential contributors to gender disparities and plan for multimodal interventions aimed at reducing or eliminating disparities in CVD care. My extensive methodological training, research experience and proposed training activities make me ideally positioned to perform the proposed studies. Furthermore, the unique resources available at the University of Colorado Denver and its affiliated campuses will ensure my success towards these goals. Specifically, my mentorship team includes experts in health services and disparities research (Drs. Masoudi, Havranek, and Blair), measurement of explicit and implicit bias using social psychology experimental procedures (Dr. Blair), adaption of survey tools based on qualitative techniques (Dr. Main) and advanced hierarchical modeling (Dr.  Dickinson). This qualified group of mentors and the training activities I propose will ensure my successful transition towards independence.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Project Narrative  We know that women are less likely than men to get certain cardiology procedures.

"TRACE-CORE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), the usual reason for hospitalization of patients with coronary heart disease, is common and high-risk. Despite remarkable advances in the management of ACS in recent decades, unrealized health gains remain from underuse of available evidence for post-ACS patients. The proposed Transitions, Risks, and Actions in Coronary Events Center for Outcomes Research and Education (TRACE-CORE) will recruit a new longitudinal cohort of post-ACS patients, conduct two research projects using the cohort, and develop the careers of four early stage investigators (ESIs). We have 4 specific aims. 1) We will recruit and follow for 2 years a COHORT of 2,500 individuals, age 21-I-, 18% African-American and 10% Hispanic, at the time of their discharge from an ACS hospitalization at 8 medical centers in Massachusetts and Georgia. We will abstract medical records from the index and subsequent hospitalizations and outpatient records. Patient interviews at the time of discharge and at 2 and 6 weeks, and 3, 12, and 24 months later will include measurements of quality of life (QoL), cognitive impairment, adherence to medications, and health related behaviors. 2) TRANSITIONS PROJECT: We will characterize the 90-day transition process for patients discharged after an ACS. We will engage a national panel to develop an evidence-based Transition Measurement Set reflecting the first 90 days after discharge and going beyond existing systems that focus on the discharge process. We will test hypotheses on the associations between quality of care and outcomes (including rehospitalization and QoL), particularly as they pertain to health disparities. 3) ACTION SCORES PROJECT: We will develop and validate two novel ""Action Scores"" that predict clinical events/mortality and QoL and which emphasize modifiable aspects of health care delivery and patient behaviors. 4) Using TRACE-CORE as a training laboratory, we will develop the CVD outcomes research careers of the four ESIs. This will include structured mentoring, key involvement of the ESIs astheco-PIs in the research projects, and preparation of new research proposals based on the TRACE-CORE infrastructure and findings. Our team involves prominent CVD outcomes researchers, methodologists, cardiologists, and other clinicians. Our innovative Action Scores should activate patients and providers to improve CVD outcomes; our Transitions Project will fill important knowledge gaps. Future studies will benefit from our data, infrastructure, Action Scores, and transition measures; building on these will also underpin the careers of future CVD outcomes researchers.             ",TRACE-CORE,8146166,U01HL105268,"['Patient Outcomes Assessments ', ' Patient Reported Outcomes ', ' acute coronary syndrome ', ' medication compliance ', ' medication adherence ', ' Process Measure ', ' Cell Nucleus ', ' Nucleus ', ' Hospitals ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Ethnicity aspects ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Coronary ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' evidence base ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Persons ', ' career ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Shortness of Breath ', ' Consent ', ' health care delivery ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' rural area ', ' 21 year old ', ' twenty-one year old ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' age 21 years ', ' age 21 ', ' Quality of Care ', ' QOC ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Consensus ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Inpatients ', ' cohort ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Science ', ' Age ', ' Commit ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Process ', ' Clinical ', ' Laboratories ', ' Communities ', ' Individual ', ' Mediating ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Measures ', ' Risk ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Cognitive ', ' Elements ', ' Event ', ' novel ', ' Interview ', ' Future ', ' Testing ', ' Medical Records ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Visit ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Data ', ' base ', ' Research ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' interest ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Mentors ', ' experience ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Methods ', ' Behavior ', ' Time ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' prototype ', ' Medical center ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Adherence ', ' Structure ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Databases ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' high risk ', ' Health behavior ', ' Patients ', ' Health ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Outcome ', ' Preparation ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' improved ', ' abstracting ', ' Measurement ', ' indexing ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Records ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Provider ', ' Respondent ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' professor ', ' Staging ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Knowledge ', ' Cardiac ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' Training ', ' Modeling ', ' Patient Discharge ', ' Discharge from Healthcare Facility ', ' Case Mixes ', ' Teaching Hospitals ', ' suburb ', ' suburbia ', ' suburban ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF MASSACHUSETTS MED SCH WORCESTER,U01,2011,1889112,0.09266901494791353
"Can CHW/PS Promote Lifestyle and Environment Changes to Reduce CVD Risk in Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HEART (Heath Education Assessment Research Team) Phase 2 is a community-based participatory research continuation project whose overall goal is to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Hispanics in El Paso, Texas using the community health workers/promotores de salud (CHW/PS) model. In HEART Phase 1 we: 1) developed a Community Health Advisory Committee (CHAC) to lead the participatory research process and guide additional means to obtain community input; 2) performed a community needs assessment to direct the research process; and 3) conducted a four-month CHW7PS pilot intervention (group classes and follow-up) to identify an optimal CHW/PS outreach approach. In addition to the lifestyle changes promoted in our pilot study, the HEART Phase 2 will add a fitness component and include a focus on the environment that contributes to CVD risk. Two new community partners have been added to emphasize our fitness and environmental approach: the YWCA facility in the Lower Valley and after-school programs available at both the YWCA and through the City of El Paso Parks and Recreation Department. We plan to foster the sustained integration of the CHW/PS model in these new community based organizations (CBOs) and public sector settings through increased organizational experience and knowledge regarding culturally-tailored lifestyle and environmental interventions. Most importantly, we will conduct an intervention in the Lower Valley of Et Paso that will build on our pilot study. Our culturally sensitive programming will be known as Mi Corazon, Mi Comunidad (My Heart, My Community). The goals of the intervention will be to 1) increase awareness and utilization of programs by Hispanic families living in the target community; 2) increase health behaviors including intentions and self-efficacy, and 3) decrease CVD risk factors among Hispanic families. Through our combined approach and with the continuous input from the CHAC, we will impact change agents, stakeholders, organizations, individuals and families. Lastly, we will define and promote a policy agenda that targets integration of CHW/PS in CBOs and public sector programs in conjunction with a dissemination plan to share our findings with a broader audience, thereby improving lifestyle and environmental factors that impact CVD risk factors for Hispanics in El Paso, Texas.          ",Can CHW/PS Promote Lifestyle and Environment Changes to Reduce CVD Risk in Texas,8064771,R24MD001785,"['Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' Policies ', ' outreach ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Awareness ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' group intervention ', ' Fostering ', ' Communities ', ' Phase ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Heart ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' intervention research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Environment ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' programs ', ' Behavior ', ' Family ', ' Process ', ' Modeling ', ' base ', ' Research ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Individual ', ' Community Health ', ' improved ', ' Goals ', ' experience ', ' System ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' Area ', ' Address ', ' service utilization ', ' Needs Assessment ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' Recreation ', ' after-school program ', ' environmental intervention ', ' Public Sector ', ' Cities ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Health behavior ', ' community based participatory research ', ' Texas ', ' Organizational Change ', ' environmental change ', ' fitness ', ' ']",NIMHD,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS EL PASO,R24,2011,523466,0.12143989664171076
"Gender Race and Ethnic Disparities Research in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Gender and racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been well documented over the past decade of research. The applicant for renewal of a Midcareer Research Award, Dr. Lori Mosca, and many of her mentees, have contributed substantially to advancement of our knowledge in this field as a result of the initial K24 award, during which time Dr. Mosca was promoted to Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. Substantial questions remain regarding the reasons for discrepancies in care and outcomes, a critical scientific gap that could inform interventions designed to reduce gender and racial/disparities in the prevention and treatment of CVD. The goal of this award is to provide the applicant with protected time to increase the pool of high quality multidisciplinary patient oriented researchers dedicated to a) understanding the independent contributions of gender and race/ethnicity to CVD outcomes and b) developing novel interventions targeted to modifiable factors that may reduce disparities. The award will also support the applicant's time to interact with and learn from other senior investigators with an interest in CVD disparities research, an appropriate and important commitment for her stage of career development. Extensive preliminary data by the applicant and her mentees has documented disparities in CVD awareness, risk factor control, and barriers to prevention. The proposed research provides a timely scientific opportunity to garner data from existing and ongoing studies uniquely suited to evaluate independent contributors to disparities and inform the design of future clinical trials and interventions aimed to reduce CVD disparities. The specific aims of the research include: 1) To examine the association between race/ethnic group and a) awareness of coronary heart disease as the leading cause of death in women, b) knowledge of heart attack symptoms and actions to take when experiencing heart attack symptoms, and c) perceptions of preventive/alternative therapies for coronary heart disease risk reduction, among nationally representative samples of women surveyed triennially from 1997-2009, 2) To determine whether the effectiveness of a screening and education program for family members of patients hospitalized with CVD to improve lifestyle factors over one year varies by race/ethnic group and to examine acculturation, baseline risk, and psychosocial factors as potential confounders/effect modifiers of program effectiveness and 3) To ascertain whether control of CVD risk factors is independently associated with race/ethnic group among consecutive patients admitted to the cardiovascular disease service line of a major medical center, and to determine whether the association with medication adherence and having a paid or non-paid (family member/friend) caregiver prior to hospitalization. The significance and impact of this research is that it will extend our knowledge about health disparities and will address the etiology of differential outcomes with the goal of developing effective interventions to optimize cardiovascular health among populations that bear a disproportionate burden of CVD risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This purpose of this research is to contribute to a reduction in gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease prevention through innovative approaches to study the causes of health disparities and to use the knowledge gained to

"Randomized Trial of Achieving Healthy Lifestyles in Psych Rehabilitation    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Life expectancy for persons with serious mental illness (SMI) is 25 to 30 years shorter than the general population with much early death attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD). At the same time, racial disparities in CVD risk and mortality are pervasive in the general population. Yet, despite health disparities between SMI and non-SMI and African Americans and Whites, we know almost nothing about potential racial differences in the epidemiology of CVD risk among persons with SMI. Exacerbating this problem is the absence of information related to participation in clinical research - we know very little about persons with SMI in studies to reduce CVD risk, much less potential differences by race.  This proposed competitive revision will utilize the Randomized Trial of Achieving Healthy Lifestyles in Psychiatric Rehabilitation (ACHIEVE) (R01MH080964), a multi-site behavioral weight loss randomized clinical trial, as a platform to examine potential disparities between African Americans and Whites with SMI in CVD risk, clinical trial involvement, mediators and outcomes. The analyses proposed are new and distinct from the trial's original aims. We propose the following Specific Aims: 1) To determine if African Americans with SMI and Whites with SMI differ in CVD risk factors, estimated 10-year CVD risk and potential mediating factors; 2) To determine if rates for African Americans with SMI differ from Whites with SMI in study interest (signing screening consent) and enrollment (signing randomization consent); 3) To determine if African Americans with SMI differ from Whites with SMI in intervention participation or trial outcomes; and 4) To evaluate CVD risk factors, estimated 10-year CVD risk, trial enrollment, intervention participation and outcomes in African Americans and Whites with and without SMI enrolled in two concurrent behavioral weight loss clinical trials. Specific Aim 4 will compare baseline and trial data of SMI participants in ACHIEVE with data from a concurrent practice-based weight loss trial, POWER, that enrolled a biracial population without SMI.  This proposal has several strengths. First, ACHIEVE provides extensive data on CVD risk factors and potential mediating socioeconomic, environmental and clinical factors. Second, ACHIEVE collects data on weight for all consumers at psychiatric rehabilitation sites regardless if they are study participants, providing an unusual opportunity to describe the target population of persons with SMI and study interest by race. Third, the POWER Trial provides a unique comparison to a weight loss trial in non-SMI including sharing several investigators, interventionists, core intervention theory and data collection protocols with ACHIEVE. Given these features, this proposal is highly responsive to NOT-MH-10-021 ""Targeted Research on Mental Health Disparities"", as it builds efficiently and creatively on currently funded work. Results should greatly enhance our understanding of racial differences in CVD risk and trial involvement among persons with SMI, thereby providing guidance to policy makers on whether special targeted efforts are needed in this high-risk group.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial disparities in cardiovascular disease are widespread in the general population, and persons with serious mental illness (SMI) also suffer from high burdens of cardiovascular disease and early mortality compared to those without SMI. Yet, among persons with SMI, we know little about potential racial disparities in cardiovascular disease risk or involvement in clinical trials to decrease cardiovascular disease risk; being a racial minority and having an SMI may be reflected in even greater heath disparities. The proposed analyses of race, cardiovascular disease risk and potential mediators in an ongoing behavioral weight loss clinical trial in persons with SMI will provide important information to greatly enhance our understanding of racial differences in cardiovascular risk and clinical trial participation in persons with SMI, and provide guidance for future interventions.              Racial disparities in cardiovascular disease are widespread in the general population, and persons with serious mental illness (SMI) also suffer from high burdens of cardiovascular disease and early mortality compared to those without SMI.

"Northern Manhattan Healthy Heart Initiative    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Northern Manhattan Healthy Heart Initiative (NMHHI) is in response to the NHLBI's interest in interventions that address multiple risk factors for people at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and utilizes the existing framework for community based participatory research in our NIH funded Center of Excellence on Health Disparities Research. We propose to examine the effectiveness of a Community Health Worker (CHW) intervention in CVD risk reduction among Caribbean Latinos. Although CHWs programs have exited in the US for over 4 decades, numerous recent reviews continue to identify the lack of rigorous evaluation data as the primary barrier limiting the dissemination of CHW programs. Our proposal addresses specific research priority needs of our community planning council. Our community partners participated in all aspects of the proposal including conception, jointly formulating the study design, and developing and writing major sections of the study intervention. The study design is a randomized controlled trial of 800 Latino patients aged 35-65 with hypertension, diabetes, or hypercholesterolemia being cared at 7 primary care sites. The study builds on a successful diabetes CHW program previously developed by our community partners and our medical center. The Specific Aim is to determine if a community based CHW intervention results in lowering of CVD risk factors at 18 months as measured by the Total Framingham Risk Score (FRS). Additional primary outcomes include blood pressure and LDL cholesterol. Secondary objectives will determine if the CHW intervention results in improvements in the following putative mechanisms that may influence the FRS: 1) Medication adherence; 2) Improvements in diet and exercise; and 3) Self efficacy, all measured using culturally validated instruments. At study conclusion we will also examine the cost effectiveness of our intervention. Our CHW intervention uses the Chronic Care Model as an overarching framework and builds on existing programmatic strengths at each CBO. Our two community partners will have a major role in this application including primary responsibly for subject recruitment, hiring and training the CHWs, delivering the CHW intervention, and collaborating on study finding dissemination. This is reflected in the budget, half of which is to the community partners. The dissemination activities to be undertaken by our team will prioritize developing mechanisms for the sustainability of the CHW intervention including discussions with our local Medicaid managed care plans which have ongoing interests in innovative cost-effective culturally appropriate health care delivery models such as CHWs.

"Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Risk for CVD and Stroke in the Jackson Heart Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite national initiatives to address health disparities, African Americans (AAs) suffer higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially stroke, than European Americans (EAs). The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was established in 2000 with the aim of generating data that would support public health recommendations for reducing CVD disparities in AAs. This landmark study has reported a higher prevalence of diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension in this entirely AA cohort compared to other U.S. mostly EA cohorts. Increased risk factor prevalence is not explained by obesity or other traditional risk factors, suggesting a potential role for additional unmeasured factors in influencing adverse cardio- metabolic outcomes. Although JHS has comprehensively assessed a wide variety of CVD risk factors, a notable gap has been the absences of objective assessment of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep patterns. The importance of rectifying this gap is underscored by recent research from predominantly EA samples that have demonstrated that SDB and insufficient sleep each are associated with increased incidence of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Our preliminary data also indicate that SDB may be more prevalent in the entirely AA JHS cohort than in predominantly white cohorts. Our long-range goal is to ameliorate CVD disparities by identifying ethnicity-specific modifiable risk factors. The proposed study will examine relationships among SDB, insufficient sleep, obesity, psycho- socio-cultural variables, and CVD risk factors in 1,200 members of the JHS cohort. Sleep apnea and sleep patterns will be objectively assessed using low burden but reliable in-home sleep apnea monitoring and wrist actigraphy. To assess intermediate measurements of CVD, particularly related to stroke and diabetes, intimal media thickness (IMT), blood pressure, and biochemical indices of glucose control and inflammation will be obtained using rigorous protocols. These data will be used to achieve three specific aims: (1) Identify risk factors for SDB and insufficient sleep in AAs, including novel measurements of major and minor stress and negative emotions relevant to minority populations; (2) Elucidate relationships between SDB severity, insufficient sleep, and risk for uncontrolled hypertension, stroke and diabetes; and (3) Quantify the extent to which SDB may statistically mediate relationships between obesity and traditional CVD risk factors. Our study will identify the role of sleep disorders as novel modifiabe risk factors for CVD in AAs, provide a basis for promoting better screening for SDB, and enhance scientific understanding of how disparities in stroke and intermediate CVD outcomes such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are impacted by sleep disorders. Finally, the results of our study will serve as the foundation for prospective analyses linking SDB to incident CVD events, morbidity, and mortality in AAs.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed study will help us better understand how sleep disorders and too little sleep contribute to the risk for stroke, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in African Americans. The data gathered by this study will help researchers develop future targeted health interventions to reduce the public health burden of cardiovascular disease and racial disparities in diabetes, hypertension and stroke.              The proposed study will help us better understand how sleep disorders and too little sleep contribute to the risk for stroke, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in African Americans.

"Pilot Testing the Signs of Health Intervention (SoHi)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of the proposed pilot study is to test the Signs of Health Intervention (SoHi) for feasibility and effectiveness in decreasing risk for Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) among Deaf adults. Effective CVD prevention programs have been developed to target various vulnerable populations but very little has been done to address CVD prevention in the Deaf community. Culturally Deaf adults are people who experienced early, significant hearing loss (a physical disability) resulting in a natural affinity for visual language (American Sign Language: ASL), and identification with a distinct cultural and linguistic minority group. Culturally Deaf adults have limited access to health related information due mainly to communication barriers, and Deaf adults' socioeconomic status is generally much lower than that of the hearing society. Deaf adults are more often unemployed or underemployed than others, have a lower mean educational level than their hearing counterparts and limited literacy with most reading at the 3rd to 4th grade level. Health information is typically provided in spoken or written language; thus Deaf adults face daunting barriers to accessing health information. The combination of communication barriers, low income, and limited education with low health literacy, secondary disabilities, and membership in ethnic minority groups put Deaf community members at significant risk for CVD. The Signs of Health Intervention (SoHi) is an innovative community based theory- driven lifestyle intervention focused on overcoming health communications barriers to promote CVD risk reduction in the Deaf community. The SoHi was developed from the investigator's previous research. The curriculum consists of classroom and community components taught entirely in American Sign Language (ASL). To date no interventions have been designed and tested to reduce CVD risks in Deaf adults. Results of this study will be used for a multi-site clinical trial and serve as a prototype to deliver other health-related programs within the Deaf community.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, disproportionately effecting ethnic minority and low income individuals.

"Gender Race and Ethnic Disparities Research in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Gender and racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been well documented over the past decade of research. The applicant for renewal of a Midcareer Research Award, Dr. Lori Mosca, and many of her mentees, have contributed substantially to advancement of our knowledge in this field as a result of the initial K24 award, during which time Dr. Mosca was promoted to Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. Substantial questions remain regarding the reasons for discrepancies in care and outcomes, a critical scientific gap that could inform interventions designed to reduce gender and racial/disparities in the prevention and treatment of CVD. The goal of this award is to provide the applicant with protected time to increase the pool of high quality multidisciplinary patient oriented researchers dedicated to a) understanding the independent contributions of gender and race/ethnicity to CVD outcomes and b) developing novel interventions targeted to modifiable factors that may reduce disparities. The award will also support the applicant's time to interact with and learn from other senior investigators with an interest in CVD disparities research, an appropriate and important commitment for her stage of career development. Extensive preliminary data by the applicant and her mentees has documented disparities in CVD awareness, risk factor control, and barriers to prevention. The proposed research provides a timely scientific opportunity to garner data from existing and ongoing studies uniquely suited to evaluate independent contributors to disparities and inform the design of future clinical trials and interventions aimed to reduce CVD disparities. The specific aims of the research include: 1) To examine the association between race/ethnic group and a) awareness of coronary heart disease as the leading cause of death in women, b) knowledge of heart attack symptoms and actions to take when experiencing heart attack symptoms, and c) perceptions of preventive/alternative therapies for coronary heart disease risk reduction, among nationally representative samples of women surveyed triennially from 1997-2009, 2) To determine whether the effectiveness of a screening and education program for family members of patients hospitalized with CVD to improve lifestyle factors over one year varies by race/ethnic group and to examine acculturation, baseline risk, and psychosocial factors as potential confounders/effect modifiers of program effectiveness and 3) To ascertain whether control of CVD risk factors is independently associated with race/ethnic group among consecutive patients admitted to the cardiovascular disease service line of a major medical center, and to determine whether the association with medication adherence and having a paid or non-paid (family member/friend) caregiver prior to hospitalization. The significance and impact of this research is that it will extend our knowledge about health disparities and will address the etiology of differential outcomes with the goal of developing effective interventions to optimize cardiovascular health among populations that bear a disproportionate burden of CVD risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This purpose of this research is to contribute to a reduction in gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease prevention through innovative approaches to study the causes of health disparities and to use the knowledge gained to inform targeted educational programs and to design future clinical studies aimed to reduce disparities and improve cardiovascular health for all.

"TRACE-CORE    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS), the usual reason for hospitalization of patients with coronary heart disease, is common and high-risk. Despite remarkable advances in the management of ACS in recent decades, unrealized health gains remain from underuse of available evidence for post-ACS patients. The proposed Transitions, Risks, and Actions in Coronary Events Center for Outcomes Research and Education (TRACE-CORE) will recruit a new longitudinal cohort of post-ACS patients, conduct two research projects using the cohort, and develop the careers of four early stage investigators (ESIs). We have 4 specific aims. 1) We will recruit and follow for 2 years a COHORT of 2,500 individuals, age 21-I-, 18% African-American and 10% Hispanic, at the time of their discharge from an ACS hospitalization at 8 medical centers in Massachusetts and Georgia. We will abstract medical records from the index and subsequent hospitalizations and outpatient records. Patient interviews at the time of discharge and at 2 and 6 weeks, and 3, 12, and 24 months later will include measurements of quality of life (QoL), cognitive impairment, adherence to medications, and health related behaviors. 2) TRANSITIONS PROJECT: We will characterize the 90-day transition process for patients discharged after an ACS. We will engage a national panel to develop an evidence-based Transition Measurement Set reflecting the first 90 days after discharge and going beyond existing systems that focus on the discharge process. We will test hypotheses on the associations between quality of care and outcomes (including rehospitalization and QoL), particularly as they pertain to health disparities. 3) ACTION SCORES PROJECT: We will develop and validate two novel ""Action Scores"" that predict clinical events/mortality and QoL and which emphasize modifiable aspects of health care delivery and patient behaviors. 4) Using TRACE-CORE as a training laboratory, we will develop the CVD outcomes research careers of the four ESIs. This will include structured mentoring, key involvement of the ESIs astheco-PIs in the research projects, and preparation of new research proposals based on the TRACE-CORE infrastructure and findings. Our team involves prominent CVD outcomes researchers, methodologists, cardiologists, and other clinicians. Our innovative Action Scores should activate patients and providers to improve CVD outcomes; our Transitions Project will fill important knowledge gaps. Future studies will benefit from our data, infrastructure, Action Scores, and transition measures; building on these will also underpin the careers of future CVD outcomes researchers.

"ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes have been observed across ethnic and gender groups which are not fully explained by consideration of traditional and novel CVD risk factors. For example, African Americans have a considerably higher prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure than Caucasians despite lipid patterns and coronary artery calcium levels that generally show relatively favorable distributions. However, only limited research has addressed the role of sleep disorders in influencing CVD in ethnic minorities despite evidence that sleep disorders disproportionately affect minority populations and, through pro-inflammatory or autonomic nervous system dysregulation, operate as risk factors for hypertension and CVD. In this proposed ancillary study to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we aim to perform standardized in-home polysomnography and 7-day wrist actigraphy in 2500 African American, Hispanic, Asian American and Caucasian individuals participating in MESA Exam 5 to derive indices of sleep apnea, quality, duration and timing. Newly collected sleep data will be rigorously standardized and comprehensively analyzed by a central Reading Center. By capitalizing on the rich clinical, physiological, anthropomorphic, and biochemical data collected longitudinally by MESA over 10 years, we will test the associations between indices of sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index, nocturnal hypoxemia), sleep duration and quality, slow wave activity, and circadian placement with the indices of CVD risk, subclinical CVD and clinical CVD as outcomes. Finally, we will quantify the extent to which sleep disorders and patterns account for previously observed variations in CVD among ethnic and sex groups.

"Diet Quality and CVD Risk Factors in a Family Based Weight Management Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Family Weight Management Study (FamWtStudy) (1R18-DK075981) is designed to evaluate the effects of a 12-month, family-based intervention designed to improve BMI z-scores and CVD risk factors in children ages 7-12 years living in a community with a high minority representation, who have a BMI z-score >85th percentile.  The families recruited will be randomized to either the Control or Experimental Intervention group. The Control Intervention group will receive a booklet with targets for healthy eating behaviors, a handout on how to increase physical activity, and quarterly visits that will include a brief review of lifestyle recommendations. The Experimental Intervention group will receive weekly sessions for 3 months that include a core diet and physical activity curriculum followed by monthly post-core sessions for 9 months promoting adherence to the curriculum. Targeted diet strategies in the core curriculum include increasing highly pigmented fruit and vegetable, and fish intake; substituting non-fat and low-fat for full-fat milk and dairy products; and reducing meat, fried food and savory snack intakes. During the one-year intervention period social support and tailored individualized counseling will be provided to the families, augmented with telephone calls and home visits addressing barriers to adherence. The goal of this ancillary study application is to expand the scope of the FamWtStudy to include 1) measures of diet quality biomarkers in child-mother/female guardian pairs, 2) measures of CVD risk factors in children and mothers/female guardians, and 3) assessment of associations within child-mother/female guardian pairs for diet quality biomarkers and CVD risk factors pre-intervention and post-intervention change. Each biomarker for diet quality was chosen because it is an indicator of a different component of the diet targeted by the parent study and can provide an indication of adherence - red blood cell (RBC) 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 for vegetable oil, meat and fish; plasma carotenoids and phylloquinone for highly pigmented fruits and vegetables; RBC 15:0 for full-fat milk and dairy products; and RBC trans fatty acids and plasma dihydrophylloquinone for fried food and savory snacks. Measuring the CVD risk factors (total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, hsCRP, glucose and insulin concentrations, blood pressure and waist circumference) in the children and mothers/female guardians, will allow for an assessment of 'spill-over' effect within families and concordance within child-mother/female guardian pairs. Regardless of the outcomes, the results will provide critical data with which to design subsequent interventions in minority communities to increase the impact of family-based obesity prevention programs and public health importance because the data will provide information in an area that continues to challenge current efforts to stem the tide of childhood obesity in a high-risk subgroup and an area that threatens to overwhelm our healthcare system. The response is time-sensitive because the FamWtStudy intervention started in August, 2009 and it is critical to have resources to collect, process, archive, transfer and analyze plasma and RBC samples.   Public Health Relevance:  The results of the proposed work will be of public health importance because they will provide objective measures for the effectiveness of a family-based program designed to prevent excess weight gain in high-risk children and potential 'spill-over' effects in the mothers/female guardians of the children. The objective measures will include indicators of diet quality and cardiovascular disease risk factors in the children and their mothers/female guardians, as well as the relationship of change within children and mothers/female guardian pairs. Developing and evaluating strategies to prevent excess weight gain is critical to support current efforts to stem the tide of childhood obesity in the U.S., a public health problem that threatens to overwhelm our healthcare system.

"Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease Risk: From Genes to Neighborhoods     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are a major public health concern as the leading cause of death and as a major source of racial/ethnic health disparities. Because CVD is a multi-factorial disease, a true understanding of its etiology requires investigations of interactions among many genetic and environmental factors. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to advance our understanding of how multi-level factors (from genes to neighborhoods) synergistically affect CVD. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop measures of neighborhood socioeconomic, built/physical, and social environments, 2) examine cross- sectional and longitudinal associations between genetic and neighborhood factors, and their interactions in relation to CVD risk factors, and 3) examine racial/ethnic differences in CVD risk factors and determine if these differences are explained by neighborhood-gene interactions. These aims will be achieved through the merging of data from the Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health (RPGEH), with data derived from available sources on neighborhoods and the built environment. The RPGEH is one of the largest research resources in the U.S. designed to examine genetic and environmental determinants of common diseases. The candidate, Mahasin Mujahid, is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. The proposed NHLBI Mentored Career Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Mujahid with the unique opportunity to augment her current expertise in general epidemiology, social epidemiology, and population health with new training in cardiovascular pathophysiology, genetic epidemiology, and statistical genetics. Moreover, Dr. Mujahid will receive the necessary support and training to work towards her long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program on the social epidemiology of cardiovascular disease with an emphasis on the underlying biological, genetic, and epigenetic pathways linking social factors to CVD.

"Can CHW/PS Promote Lifestyle and Environment Changes to Reduce CVD Risk in Texas    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HEART (Heath Education Assessment Research Team) Phase 2 is a community-based participatory research continuation project whose overall goal is to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in Hispanics in El Paso, Texas using the community health workers/promotores de salud (CHW/PS) model. In HEART Phase 1 we: 1) developed a Community Health Advisory Committee (CHAC) to lead the participatory research process and guide additional means to obtain community input; 2) performed a community needs assessment to direct the research process; and 3) conducted a four-month CHW7PS pilot intervention (group classes and follow-up) to identify an optimal CHW/PS outreach approach. In addition to the lifestyle changes promoted in our pilot study, the HEART Phase 2 will add a fitness component and include a focus on the environment that contributes to CVD risk. Two new community partners have been added to emphasize our fitness and environmental approach: the YWCA facility in the Lower Valley and after-school programs available at both the YWCA and through the City of El Paso Parks and Recreation Department. We plan to foster the sustained integration of the CHW/PS model in these new community based organizations (CBOs) and public sector settings through increased organizational experience and knowledge regarding culturally-tailored lifestyle and environmental interventions. Most importantly, we will conduct an intervention in the Lower Valley of Et Paso that will build on our pilot study. Our culturally sensitive programming will be known as Mi Corazon, Mi Comunidad (My Heart, My Community). The goals of the intervention will be to 1) increase awareness and utilization of programs by Hispanic families living in the target community; 2) increase health behaviors including intentions and self-efficacy, and 3) decrease CVD risk factors among Hispanic families. Through our combined approach and with the continuous input from the CHAC, we will impact change agents, stakeholders, organizations, individuals and families. Lastly, we will define and promote a policy agenda that targets integration of CHW/PS in CBOs and public sector programs in conjunction with a dissemination plan to share our findings with a broader audience, thereby improving lifestyle and environmental factors that impact CVD risk factors for Hispanics in El Paso, Texas.

"Biobehavioral Genetics of CVD Risk Heart diseases remain the leading cause of death in the US and is an important focus area for the Healthy  People 2020 initiative. The long term goal ofthis application is to determine the causes of aggregation of  multiple biological, psychological and life-style related cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in  individuals and their covariation in populations. It is possible that genetic variation associated with central  physiological mechanisms, lil<e the serotonergic and inflammatory pathways, may partially mediate the  aggregation of CVD risk phenotypes. The proposed project aims to comprehensively test several genes in  the serotonin pathway (SLC6A4, MAOA, TPH1, TPH2, HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR2C) and genes of  inflammatory markers (ILIp, IL6, CRP, TNFa, SELE, SELP, ICAM 1, VCAM 1) for association with multiple  CVD risk domains. Specifically, this project aims to: 1)To examine the association between polymorphisms  (individually and as haplotypes) in the above mentioned genes and psychological, biological and  lifestyle-related CVD risk factors in samples of 1173 European American (EA) and 861 African American  (AA) individuals enrolled in the HeartSCORE project, using multivariate and univariate models; 2) To  confirm genotype associations after controlling for population stratification using genomic control methods in  EA and individual admixture based methods in AA. 3) To examine whether investigated polymorphisms  underlie the covariation of CVD risk factors, using structural equation modeling. 4)To determine whether  studied polymorphisms predict progression of biological risk factors in EA and AA using multivariate  statistics and mixed models. The work during the ROO phase will follow from the work done during the  current K99 phase which focused on SLC6A4, HTR2A and CRP genes and on aims 1-3. Once identified, a  common genetic variant underlying multiple dimensions of CVD risk may provide avenues towards  development of new and novel therapeutics. Simultaneous investigation in two different populations is also  expected to provide insights into potential causes undedying racial disparities in CVD risk and prevalence. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Identification of novel genetic  risk factors that may underlie the aggregation of multiple biological, psychological and lifestyle related CVD  risk factors in individuals has tremendous potential to guide the development of comprehensive evaluation  and treatment options.",Biobehavioral Genetics of CVD Risk,8309445,R00HL094767,"['Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Anxiety ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Ortonal ', ' Metolquizolone ', ' MTQ ', ' MAOA ', ' 3,4-Dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-3-o-tolylquinazoline ', ' 2-Methyl-3-o-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' 2-Methyl-3-(2-methylphenyl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' Methaqualone ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Phenotype ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Population Control ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Enteramine ', ' 5HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5-HT ', ' 3-(2-Aminoethyl)-1H-indol-5-ol ', ' Serotonin ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule ', ' VCAM-1 ', ' VCAM ', ' Inducible Cell Adhesion Molecule 110 ', ' INCAM-110 ', ' CD106 Antigens ', ' CD106 ', ' Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' sodium-dependent serotonin transporter ', ' 5HTT protein ', ' 5HT transporter ', ' serotonin transporter ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Serotonin 2A Receptor ', ' 5-HT2A Receptor ', ' 5-HT(2A) Receptor ', ' Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' ICAM ', ' intercellular cell adhesion molecule ', ' novel ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Hepatocyte Stimulatory Factor Gene ', ' HSF Gene ', ' Beta-2 Gene Interferon ', ' BSF2 Gene ', ' BSF-2 Gene ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor 2 Gene ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor Gene ', ' Interleukin-6 Gene ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) Gene ', ' IL6 ', ' IL-6 Gene ', ' IFNB2 Gene ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor Gene ', ' IL6 gene ', ' Selectin E Gene ', ' SELE ', ' LECAM2 ', ' Endothelial Leukocyte Adhesion Molecule 1 Gene ', ' ESEL ', ' ELAM1 ', ' ELAM ', ' CD62E Gene ', ' CD62E ', ' SELE gene ', ' Serotonin 5-HT-2 Receptor Gene ', ' HTR2A ', ' HTR2 Gene ', ' HTR2 ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor 2A Gene ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin) Receptor 2A Gene ', ' 5-HT2A ', ' 5-HT-2A Gene ', ' HTR2A gene ', ' TPH2 ', ' TDO2 gene ', ' Admixture ', ' Stratification ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' genetic variant ', ' negative emotional state ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2012,248512,0.18988327103054636
"Social protection, work and family strain: disadvantage effects in US and Europe    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is losing ground in health: our ranking in life expectancy is near the bottom of European countries and comparisons of major chronic conditions in the US and 13 European countries showed the US to have higher disease prevalence than any comparison country. The diverging life expectancy (LE) trends have been most distinct for American women, but the US also fares poorly with regard to male life expectancy and infant mortality. The health gap is largest among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, but even well- educated Americans have worse health than many of Europeans. We hypothesize that the explanations for the American health disadvantage have roots in the challenging social context faced by families, and in particular women, in post-WWII America. Since WWII, American society has been marked by: high fertility; high female labor market participation; weak labor laws and family protection policies; and family instability, and increased single parenthood. The combination or convergence of these factors created a ""perfect storm"" that threatened vulnerable families and imposed extreme stresses even on the relatively advantaged. Such social conditions might work via influencing health behaviors or through more direct physiological mechanisms. We have developed a theoretical framework for this confluence of conditions that builds on the job strain models incorporating dimensions of demand, control and support but adds an important dimension related to family that extends the strain model beyond work to family life. Over time Americans, especially women, have experienced high demands in terms of full time work often with high family demands, coupled with low formal support ( social protection policies) or informal support from other family members. This combination especially among workers with low job control leads to a cumulative disadvantage taking its toll in health over time. In order to understand whether these social conditions account for cross area variations in risk we must understand whether either the distribution and/or the toxicity of the ""risk"" vary across areas. We draw from ongoing studies including HRS, SHARE and ELSA, mortality data at a country level (using the human mortality files) and data on public policies, collected from the CPS,SIPP and SHARELIFE and OECD. We propose 4 specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the distribution of work-family strain for females born 1920-1960, across the US and EU. Aim 2: Assess the differential toxicity of work-family strain on CVD risk behaviors and biomarkers, incidence of stroke and heart disease, CVD mortality, and life expectancy in the US and Europe. Aim 3: Assess whether distributions or the toxicity of work-family strain explain geographic and temporal variations in CVD and life expectancy. Aim 4: Assess impacts of trends in work-family strain on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in the US and Europe.        With the vast majority of women in the labor force who also have young children and with the aging of societies virtually across the globe, there is an urgent public health need to provide both formal (policy) and informal (family) support to women and their families. Evidence suggests that work family strain has an adverse impact on health outcomes for low wage employees and young children and perhaps other groups.

"ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes have been observed across ethnic and gender groups which are not fully explained by consideration of traditional and novel CVD risk factors. For example, African Americans have a considerably higher prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure than Caucasians despite lipid patterns and coronary artery calcium levels that generally show relatively favorable distributions. However, only limited research has addressed the role of sleep disorders in influencing CVD in ethnic minorities despite evidence that sleep disorders disproportionately affect minority populations and, through pro-inflammatory or autonomic nervous system dysregulation, operate as risk factors for hypertension and CVD. In this proposed ancillary study to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we aim to perform standardized in-home polysomnography and 7-day wrist actigraphy in 2500 African American, Hispanic, Asian American and Caucasian individuals participating in MESA Exam 5 to derive indices of sleep apnea, quality, duration and timing. Newly collected sleep data will be rigorously standardized and comprehensively analyzed by a central Reading Center. By capitalizing on the rich clinical, physiological, anthropomorphic, and biochemical data collected longitudinally by MESA over 10 years, we will test the associations between indices of sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index, nocturnal hypoxemia), sleep duration and quality, slow wave activity, and circadian placement with the indices of CVD risk, subclinical CVD and clinical CVD as outcomes. Finally, we will quantify the extent to which sleep disorders and patterns account for previously observed variations in CVD among ethnic and sex groups. By defining the role of sleep disorders in CVD in ethnic minorities, these activities may direct future interventions directed at reducing ethnic disparities in chronic health conditions. Project Narrative  The proposed addition of objective measurements of sleep to MESA will fill an important gap in risk factor data in this unique cohort and allow the role of sleep disorders in atherosclerosis and CVD pathogenesis to be better defined, thus paving the way for important intervention studies that may improve health disparities in CVD.",ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH

"Gender Disparities in Invasive CVD Procedure Use: the Role of Provider Bias PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  My long-term career goal is to become a nationally recognized independent investigator and expert in cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities with an emphasis on interventions designed to eliminate disparities. I have laid a strong foundation for reaching this goal by defining a broad mentoring network, obtaining formal training in health services research, and leading several research projects. To date, my research has primarily focused on describing gender disparities in CVD care. For example, I have shown that women with CVD receive fewer invasive procedures than men with CVD. Despite extensive research documenting these disparities, few have investigated their causes. I am committing my career to addressing this gap by conducting research aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind gender disparities to achieve my ultimate goal of instituting evidence-based interventions to reduce gender disparities in CVD care.    The Institute of Medicine has identified provider bias as a key contributor to disparities in health care. However, the role of provider bias in gender-based decisions surrounding the use of invasive CVD procedures is poorly characterized. In order to more accurately and fully measure provider attitudes, advanced qualitative and social psychology techniques must be employed; skills I wish to develop. Therefore, I seek a Career Development Award to allow me time and support to pursue mentored research aimed at measuring provider gender attitudes and training in the areas of qualitative research, social psychology and advanced biostatistical techniques. The proposed research and training are a crucial to move my research forward from defining gender disparities towards research aimed at understanding the causes of these disparities.    Although studies have implicated provider bias as the cause of gender disparities in CVD care, to our knowledge, no study has directly measured such attitudes using validated instruments. Tools have been developed in other fields that measure implicit (unconscious) gender attitudes such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). These tools have been widely used to explain gender differences in social outcomes including job promotions and performance evaluations, but they have not been widely applied to the study of health care disparities. Furthermore, these tools may need to be adapted to capture concepts specific to CVD care, such as a provider's belief about women's willingness to undergo invasive procedures or whether a provider views women as fragile and therefore more likely to have a complication from an invasive procedure. This gap in knowledge is a barrier to developing evidence-based interventions to address gender disparities.    The research objectives of this Career Development Award are to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes to apply to decisions concerning the use of invasive CVD procedures and to conduct preliminary tests of these adapted measures. The research will occur in three steps. For aim 1, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with cardiologists, using two case scenarios in which an invasive cardiac procedure might be recommended. These interviews will be used to determine providers' gender attitudes specific to invasive cardiac procedures, and the results will then be used to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes. Next, in aim 2, I will test the adapted measures within a second cohort of cardiologists to determine the relationship between measured attitudes and the providers' decision to use an invasive cardiac procedure with women and men in the standard case scenarios. Finally, in aim 3, I will conduct a study to test my ability to link the adapted measures results and the subject cardiologists' actual clinical decisions obtained from retrospective clinical data.    As a health services researcher, woman and practicing cardiologist, I am uniquely positioned to make important contributions to the field of gender disparities and CVD. I will bridge the fields of social psychology and health services research in order to gain a better understanding of potential contributors to gender disparities and plan for multimodal interventions aimed at reducing or eliminating disparities in CVD care. My extensive methodological training, research experience and proposed training activities make me ideally positioned to perform the proposed studies. Furthermore, the unique resources available at the University of Colorado Denver and its affiliated campuses will ensure my success towards these goals. Specifically, my mentorship team includes experts in health services and disparities research (Drs. Masoudi, Havranek, and Blair), measurement of explicit and implicit bias using social psychology experimental procedures (Dr. Blair), adaption of survey tools based on qualitative techniques (Dr. Main) and advanced hierarchical modeling (Dr. Dickinson). This qualified group of mentors and the training activities I propose will ensure my successful transition towards independence. Project Narrative  We know that women are less likely than men to get certain cardiology procedures. The purpose of this research project is to understand if health care providers' beliefs, or stereotypes, about the traits that women and men have potentially explain these differences.",Gender Disparities in Invasive CVD Procedure Use: the Role of Provider Bias,8312535,K08HL103776,"['angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Angiography ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Colorado ', ' Complication ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2012,131490,0.11365928591743057
"Center for Reduce CVD Disparities: Genes, Clinics, and Communities Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affect low income and minority populations. Lenoir County, North Carolina is among the poorest in the state and situated in the ""stroke belt"" with significantly elevated heart disease, stroke, and obesity rates relative to state levels already well above the national average. At the same time, this county is home to many clinical and public health efforts on which to build. We propose an integrated set of three interdisciplinary studies in Lenoir County to: 1) determine genetic factors associated with CVD risk; 2) understand the multilevel determinants of poor health outcomes and the potential social and community capital that can support sustainable change; 3) work with community leaders, health professionals, and citizens to apply these understandings to improved practice-based management of hypertension and community-centered lifestyle management, and test the impact on improving outcomes and reducing disparities in cardiovascular health among 700 participants. This will include an innovative partnership with a nonprofit call center, Connect Inc, adding a lifestyle and medication adherence coaching component to their current focus on jobs, employment, and benefits counseling; 4) test the impact, reach, adoption, and sustainability of clinical, community-level, and policy interventions , including economic development potential; and 5) develop and implement strategies for translation and dissemination of the clinic-based and community-level interventions to other underserved regions. This work will be supported by an administrative core housed in the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (a CDC funded Prevention Research Center with a focus on community-based participatory research). Additional cores include: 1) a Genomic Bioinformatics Core available to this project and other PSO programs to analyze genetic/genomic data and other pathways of interest; and 2) a Social Determinants/Economic Development/Dissemination Core to understand the interface between poverty and health, and explore strategies with the potential to create jobs while promoting health. Additional core support for data collection, community engagement, and economic development will be leveraged through the UNC CTSA (NC TraCS) and the Community-Campus Partnership for Tomorrow, which is the result of a statewide assessment led to the President of the UNC (16 campus) system to ""to produce a more proactively responsive University focused on meeting the challenges of the state over the next 20 years.""

"Mentoring in community influences on CVD risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a proposal for a midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research. This career development award will give Dr. Corbie-Smith the dedicated time to focus on patient-oriented research in cardiovascular disease prevention, and recruit and mentor some of the brightest young scientists at UNC into healthcare disparities research. Her immediate career objectives are: 1) To extend her work in engaging communities of color in research by developing interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease that address patients in the context of their communities; 2) To understand the influence of community factors in underserved communities and their impact on healthcare utilization and health outcomes in cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors; and 3) To provide outstanding mentorship by creating a training environment that supports the conduct of high impact research in cardiovascular prevention and outcomes. The specific aims for the new research to be supported through this K24 Midcareer Investigator award include 1) Determine the feasibility of training a current cohort of community health advisors as navigators to link residents with multiple cardiovascular risk factors to local healthcare systems; 2) Determine the impact of navigators on cardiovascular risk factor control (HgbA1C, physical activity, BP control, smoking) and access to care for community members at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; 3) Identify community and social factors that influence cardiovascular risk factor control and outcomes. This two-arm trial will investigate the role of navigators on cardiovascular outcomes in community based outreach programs to improve access and utilization of medical services. Two to three navigators at each of the four sites will be utilized. Patients will be randomized to either a navigator intervention or to usual patient management practices, with measurement at baseline and six months. This study targets a disease condition and population of significant importance - CVD risk factor prevention in rural African Americans - and extends an existing effective model in several important ways. This study situates the navigator and patient within the community (rather than the healthcare system) thus increasing the cultural relevance of the intervention. Rather than a focus on one condition, navigators will support access and management of several chronic conditions, thus addressing the reality of multiple co-morbidities in underserved patients. Lastly, augmenting patient data with community variables allows a comprehensive analysis of external influence on cardiovascular disease prevention and healthcare utilization.

"Childhood SES Factors: Impact on age-related cognitive and vascular health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): U.S. blacks have a life expectancy that is significantly shorter than whites, with a larger difference between men than women. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the single largest contributor to this disparity. Geographic disparities in health are similar to racial disparities in magnitude and effect. There is growing recognition that there are shared risk factors for CVD and cognitive impairment. Much of the research attempting to explain these racial and geographic disparities in health has focused on the participant's socioeconomic status (SES) or place of residence at the time of diagnosis or death. Increasing evidence, however, points to an important role of exposures during earlier lifecourse periods. The role of lifecourse exposures is difficult to study, however, because migration patterns obscure the links between geographic exposures and long- term health outcomes. The general aim of this study is to identify childhood and family SES factors (CH-SES) that shape disparities in vascular and cognitive health. Designed to determine the causes of racial and geographic differences in stroke incidence, mortality and cognitive decline, the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study is a national population-based cohort study. REGARDS recruited 30,239 participants aged 45 or older, from 2003-2007, 45% men, 42% blacks. Data were collected using a combination of telephone interview, in-home physical exam, and self-administered questionnaire. Participants are currently being followed for CVD events and cognitive assessments. Our approach builds on the exceptional resources in REGARDS, in particular, the detailed residential history data. This study proposes to obtain data on CH-SES factors from three sources: 1) new data collected from the cohort via a mail-questionnaire; 2) linking existing REGARDS data on childhood residence to public Census data on family and community level SES conditions; and 3) linking existing REGARDS data on childhood residence to historic public school records on school quality at the county/school district level. These data on CH-SES will be linked to the detailed data on demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort and examined as predictors of CVD and cognitive decline over follow-up.        This research focuses on the contribution of social factors to geographic and racial disparities in cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment.

"Effects of Yoga on CVD Risk Factors among African Americans: Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and continues to be one of the nation's largest racial health disparity conditions: compared to non-Hispanic whites, African Americans are 30 percent more likely to die from heart disease and 60 percent more likely to die from a stroke. African Americans are also more likely than whites to have risk factors for CVD, such as hypertension and elevated levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c. Clinical studies of the effects of yoga on mitigating CVD risk factors, although small in nature, have demonstrated promising results. The proposed study, which utilizes a randomized, hybrid phase-in/cross- over design, includes 500 adult hypertensive or pre-hypertensive African American participants from the Jackson Heart Study to test the effect of yoga classes three times per week for 12 weeks on CVD risk factors. The three specific aims of the study are to measure the effect yoga can have on (1) risks for CVD, including hypertension, inflammation, and elevated levels of lipids and hemoglobin A1c; (2) perceived levels of stress; and (3) health behaviors and health-related quality of life. Primary outcomes will be changes in participants' systolic and diastolic blood pressure and their levels of CRP, fibrinogen, homocysteine, and interleukin-6. Secondary outcomes will be changes in participants' levels of HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and fasting triglycerides; their perceived levels of stress; and their reported health behaviors and health-related quality of life. Because of the number of participants and the rigor of the research design, this study will be the first of its kind. The study team is in the fortunate position to be able to recruit and retain a large number of participants because of its longstanding-and remarkably close-relationship through their joint association with the Jackson Heart Study. Results will be disseminated on a large scale to a variety of professional and lay audiences. If the results of the intervention yield statistically significant improvement in individuals' CVD risk factors, the nation will benefit from an easily replicable model that can be used to help reduce CVD risk.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and African Americans have higher rates of heart disease and their risk factors than do whites. We want to see if practicing yoga three times a week can help reduce risk factors for heart disease in African Americans. If we find out that it does, then we can provide the nation with an inexpensive way in which to help improve heart health.

"Early Life Adversity, Sleep, and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men suffer disproportionately from premature mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to their white counterparts, perhaps in part due to blacks' greater exposure to social and economic adversity across the life span as suggested by the weathering hypothesis. This application suggests that (a) black-white differences in CVD in adulthood stem from cumulative adversity correlated with race much earlier in life; and (b) early life exposures at the individual, family, and neighborhood level mus be considered simultaneously. Not emphasized in the weathering hypothesis is that intra- and inter-personal and cultural resources also may accumulate over the life course (labeled reserve capacity) and moderate effects of early life adversity; and that there may also be a critical perio exposure to adverse life events. Sleep may be an important factor here because of its likely relation to race and socioeconomic status (SES), and possibly to CVD events. This application focuses on the developmental antecedents of sleep, optimal cardiovascular (CV) health (defined by AHA criteria), and CVD risk in a population-based study of middle-aged black and white men who have been followed since they were enrolled in the first grade. They have been assessed repeatedly for health behaviors and academic and social competence; parent health behaviors, parenting practices, and household SES; and neighborhood characteristics, including census track SES, violence exposure, and community cohesiveness and involvement; these measures have been summarized into developmentally appropriate periods. In 300 men now in their late thirties, we propose to collect measures of CV biomarkers and psychosocial risk factors and sleep to test the following: 1) the extent of black/white differences in sleep, optimal CV health, and CVD risk, and sleep; 2) whether early adverse family and neighborhood environments, particularly during adolescence, predict adult optimal CV health, CVD risk, and sleep; and 3) if reserve capacity reduces the impact of early adverse environments. Knowledge gained from this project may identify the early life experiences and their timing that render black men particularly vulnerable to later CVD.        PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the developmental antecedents of poor sleep and cardiovascular risk in black and white men will facilitate the design and timing of interventions to prevent adverse health consequences of early life experiences. This project will facilitate reaching two overarching goals of Healthy People 2020: a) achieving health equity and eliminating health disparities; and b) promoting healthy development and healthy behaviors across all life stages.                Understanding the developmental antecedents of poor sleep and cardiovascular risk in black and white men will facilitate the design and timing of interventions to prevent adverse health consequences of early life experiences.

"Boston Puerto Rican Health Study - CVD Risk Factors Puerto Rican adults living on the mainland US have documented health disparities; however, little research has been conducted with this second largest Hispanic subgroup. Our long-term goal is to understand the complex interactions of diet and other behavioral and environmental factors, genetics, and psychosocial stress on the high and apparently increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in Puerto Rican adults. As this group is rapidly growing, understanding the reasons for this risk is of great importance. Our initial funding period for the Boston Puerto Rican Center on Population Health and Health Disparities (BPR-CPHHD, 2003-08) focused on the role of stress on physical disability and cognitive decline, through physiological dysregulation or ""allostatic load."" During that investigation, it became clear that risk factors for CVD were highly prevalent. These findings are in contrast to the commonly held belief that there is a Hispanic paradox¿lower heart disease and mortality despite greater poverty. Importantly, the Puerto Rican population differs considerably in ancestral genetic history and in exposures to known risk factors from other Hispanic groups. They have unique dietary intake patterns, as well as social, cultural and environmental structures that contribute and affect reaction to stressors. During our initial funding period, we successfully assembled a cohort of 1450 Puerto Rican adults, aged 45-75 years at baseline, and have completed (to date) more than 900 two-year follow-up interviews¿we are continuing, with the expectation of completing at least 1150. As this population is aging and growing rapidly, the high prevalence and apparent cohort effect of increased heart disease risk factors suggest that 1) this population has serious health disparities in heart disease risk factors and 2) heart disease will become an even greater problem for this group in the near future. Our overall aim for this renewal is, therefore, to extend follow-up and to measure and analyze relevant characteristics and CVD risk factors, and to add additional contextual and outcome measures for CVD risk in this established cohort of Puerto Rican adults, so that we may better understand the dynamics of these disparities. Our model follows the transdisciplinary ""cells to society"" concept developed jointly with our partner CPHHDs during the initial funding period, with consideration of genetic variation in relation to longitudinal change in allostatic load and biochemical indicators of risk, to more concrete indicators of disease (ankle brachial index (ABI) and intima media thickness (IMT)); with additional focus on social networks, neighborhood characteristics (physical space and access to food) and environment (air pollution) factors as social determinants of health. Finally, using community based participatory techniques, we will implement and test a multidimensional intervention that focuses on diet and exercise, but that also fully considers the social and physical environment to ensure success. With participation of our community partner. La Alianza Hispana, and the support of our administrative, biostatistics and laboratory cores, our team is efficiently poised to make significant contributions to understanding the factors that contribute to the apparent growing threat of heart disease in this highly disadvantaged group¿while providing insights that may be useful to other vulnerable groups. The continuation of our cohort, with its rich constellation of measures, will allow us to unravel some of the complex etiologic interactions which contribute to CVD risk, so that effective interventions maybe implemented. This work takes the innovative and necessary approach of examining complex interactions of physiological measures, biological stress, and psychosocial evaluation on multiple levels to understand the causes of disproportionate health disparities in Puerto Ricans.

"Biobehavioral Genetics of CVD Risk Heart diseases remain the leading cause of death in the US and is an important focus area for the Healthy  People 2020 initiative. The long term goal ofthis application is to determine the causes of aggregation of  multiple biological, psychological and life-style related cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in  individuals and their covariation in populations. It is possible that genetic variation associated with central  physiological mechanisms, lil<e the serotonergic and inflammatory pathways, may partially mediate the  aggregation of CVD risk phenotypes. The proposed project aims to comprehensively test several genes in  the serotonin pathway (SLC6A4, MAOA, TPH1, TPH2, HTR1A, HTR1B, HTR2A, HTR2C) and genes of  inflammatory markers (ILIp, IL6, CRP, TNFa, SELE, SELP, ICAM 1, VCAM 1) for association with multiple  CVD risk domains. Specifically, this project aims to: 1)To examine the association between polymorphisms  (individually and as haplotypes) in the above mentioned genes and psychological, biological and  lifestyle-related CVD risk factors in samples of 1173 European American (EA) and 861 African American  (AA) individuals enrolled in the HeartSCORE project, using multivariate and univariate models; 2) To  confirm genotype associations after controlling for population stratification using genomic control methods in  EA and individual admixture based methods in AA. 3) To examine whether investigated polymorphisms  underlie the covariation of CVD risk factors, using structural equation modeling. 4)To determine whether  studied polymorphisms predict progression of biological risk factors in EA and AA using multivariate  statistics and mixed models. The work during the ROO phase will follow from the work done during the  current K99 phase which focused on SLC6A4, HTR2A and CRP genes and on aims 1-3. Once identified, a  common genetic variant underlying multiple dimensions of CVD risk may provide avenues towards  development of new and novel therapeutics. Simultaneous investigation in two different populations is also  expected to provide insights into potential causes undedying racial disparities in CVD risk and prevalence. Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Identification of novel genetic  risk factors that may underlie the aggregation of multiple biological, psychological and lifestyle related CVD  risk factors in individuals has tremendous potential to guide the development of comprehensive evaluation  and treatment options.",Biobehavioral Genetics of CVD Risk,8477236,R00HL094767,"['Aggression ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Anxiety ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' Genes ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Ortonal ', ' Metolquizolone ', ' MTQ ', ' MAOA ', ' 3,4-Dihydro-2-methyl-4-oxo-3-o-tolylquinazoline ', ' 2-Methyl-3-o-tolyl-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' 2-Methyl-3-(2-methylphenyl)-4(3H)-quinazolinone ', ' Methaqualone ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Phenotype ', ' polymorphism ', ' Polymorphism (Genetics) ', ' Genetic Polymorphism ', ' Population Control ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Hippophaine ', ' Enteramine ', ' 5HT ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine ', ' 5-HT ', ' 3-(2-Aminoethyl)-1H-indol-5-ol ', ' Serotonin ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' allelic variant ', ' Genetic Variation ', ' Genetic Diversity ', ' Gene variant ', ' Variation (Genetics) ', ' Work ', ' Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule ', ' VCAM-1 ', ' VCAM ', ' Inducible Cell Adhesion Molecule 110 ', ' INCAM-110 ', ' CD106 Antigens ', ' CD106 ', ' Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' sodium-dependent serotonin transporter ', ' 5HTT protein ', ' 5HT transporter ', ' serotonin transporter ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Serotonin 2A Receptor ', ' 5-HT2A Receptor ', ' 5-HT(2A) Receptor ', ' Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Investigation ', ' Dimensions ', ' Equation ', ' American ', ' ICAM ', ' intercellular cell adhesion molecule ', ' novel ', ' inherited factor ', ' genetic risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Genomics ', ' Metabolic syndrome ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Interleukin-6 Gene ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) Gene ', ' IL6 ', ' IL-6 Gene ', ' IFNB2 Gene ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor Gene ', ' Hepatocyte Stimulatory Factor Gene ', ' HSF Gene ', ' Beta-2 Gene Interferon ', ' BSF2 Gene ', ' BSF-2 Gene ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor 2 Gene ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor Gene ', ' IL6 gene ', ' Selectin E Gene ', ' SELE ', ' LECAM2 ', ' Endothelial Leukocyte Adhesion Molecule 1 Gene ', ' ESEL ', ' ELAM1 ', ' ELAM ', ' CD62E Gene ', ' CD62E ', ' SELE gene ', ' Serotonin 5-HT-2 Receptor Gene ', ' HTR2A ', ' HTR2 Gene ', ' HTR2 ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine Receptor 2A Gene ', ' 5-Hydroxytryptamine (Serotonin) Receptor 2A Gene ', ' 5-HT2A ', ' 5-HT-2A Gene ', ' HTR2A gene ', ' TPH2 ', ' TDO2 gene ', ' Admixture ', ' Stratification ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' genetic variant ', ' negative emotional state ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' next generation therapeutics ', ' new therapeutics ', ' novel therapeutics ', ' inflammation marker ', ' inflammatory marker ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R00,2013,236569,0.18988327103054636
"Mentoring in community influences on CVD risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a proposal for a midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research. This career development award will give Dr. Corbie-Smith the dedicated time to focus on patient-oriented research in cardiovascular disease prevention, and recruit and mentor some of the brightest young scientists at UNC into healthcare disparities research. Her immediate career objectives are: 1) To extend her work in engaging communities of color in research by developing interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease that address patients in the context of their communities; 2) To understand the influence of community factors in underserved communities and their impact on healthcare utilization and health outcomes in cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors; and 3) To provide outstanding mentorship by creating a training environment that supports the conduct of high impact research in cardiovascular prevention and outcomes. The specific aims for the new research to be supported through this K24 Midcareer Investigator award include 1) Determine the feasibility of training a current cohort of community health advisors as navigators to link residents with multiple cardiovascular risk factors to local healthcare systems; 2) Determine the impact of navigators on cardiovascular risk factor control (HgbA1C, physical activity, BP control, smoking) and access to care for community members at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; 3) Identify community and social factors that influence cardiovascular risk factor control and outcomes. This two-arm trial will investigate the role of navigators on cardiovascular outcomes in community based outreach programs to improve access and utilization of medical services. Two to three navigators at each of the four sites will be utilized. Patients will be randomized to either a navigator intervention or to usual patient management practices, with measurement at baseline and six months. This study targets a disease condition and population of significant importance - CVD risk factor prevention in rural African Americans - and extends an existing effective model in several important ways. This study situates the navigator and patient within the community (rather than the healthcare system) thus increasing the cultural relevance of the intervention. Rather than a focus on one condition, navigators will support access and management of several chronic conditions, thus addressing the reality of multiple co-morbidities in underserved patients. Lastly, augmenting patient data with community variables allows a comprehensive analysis of external influence on cardiovascular disease prevention and healthcare utilization.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will advance public health by testing a patient navigator program to improve access to and quality of care for those with heart disease risk factors.

"Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease Risk: From Genes to Neighborhoods     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are a major public health concern as the leading cause of death and as a major source of racial/ethnic health disparities. Because CVD is a multi-factorial disease, a true understanding of its etiology requires investigations of interactions among many genetic and environmental factors. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to advance our understanding of how multi-level factors (from genes to neighborhoods) synergistically affect CVD. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop measures of neighborhood socioeconomic, built/physical, and social environments, 2) examine cross- sectional and longitudinal associations between genetic and neighborhood factors, and their interactions in relation to CVD risk factors, and 3) examine racial/ethnic differences in CVD risk factors and determine if these differences are explained by neighborhood-gene interactions. These aims will be achieved through the merging of data from the Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health (RPGEH), with data derived from available sources on neighborhoods and the built environment. The RPGEH is one of the largest research resources in the U.S. designed to examine genetic and environmental determinants of common diseases. The candidate, Mahasin Mujahid, is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. The proposed NHLBI Mentored Career Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Mujahid with the unique opportunity to augment her current expertise in general epidemiology, social epidemiology, and population health with new training in cardiovascular pathophysiology, genetic epidemiology, and statistical genetics. Moreover, Dr. Mujahid will receive the necessary support and training to work towards her long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program on the social epidemiology of cardiovascular disease with an emphasis on the underlying biological, genetic, and epigenetic pathways linking social factors to CVD.  (End of Abstract)                  RELEVANCE: The results of this research project and future studies may enhance our understanding of how factors operating at multiple levels (from genes to neighborhoods) interact to increase CVD risk in multi-ethnic populations.",Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease Risk: From Genes to Neighborhoods,8514721,K01HL115494,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Mentors ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Outcome Study ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' gene interaction ', ' professor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population health ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2013,137511,0.11040575253383283
"Early Life Adversity, Sleep, and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men suffer disproportionately from premature mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to their white counterparts, perhaps in part due to blacks' greater exposure to social and economic adversity across the life span as suggested by the weathering hypothesis. This application suggests that (a) black-white differences in CVD in adulthood stem from cumulative adversity correlated with race much earlier in life; and (b) early life exposures at the individual, family, and neighborhood level mus be considered simultaneously. Not emphasized in the weathering hypothesis is that intra- and inter-personal and cultural resources also may accumulate over the life course (labeled reserve capacity) and moderate effects of early life adversity; and that there may also be a critical perio exposure to adverse life events. Sleep may be an important factor here because of its likely relation to race and socioeconomic status (SES), and possibly to CVD events. This application focuses on the developmental antecedents of sleep, optimal cardiovascular (CV) health (defined by AHA criteria), and CVD risk in a population-based study of middle-aged black and white men who have been followed since they were enrolled in the first grade. They have been assessed repeatedly for health behaviors and academic and social competence; parent health behaviors, parenting practices, and household SES; and neighborhood characteristics, including census track SES, violence exposure, and community cohesiveness and involvement; these measures have been summarized into developmentally appropriate periods. In 300 men now in their late thirties, we propose to collect measures of CV biomarkers and psychosocial risk factors and sleep to test the following: 1) the extent of black/white differences in sleep, optimal CV health, and CVD risk, and sleep; 2) whether early adverse family and neighborhood environments, particularly during adolescence, predict adult optimal CV health, CVD risk, and sleep; and 3) if reserve capacity reduces the impact of early adverse environments. Knowledge gained from this project may identify the early life experiences and their timing that render black men particularly vulnerable to later CVD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the developmental antecedents of poor sleep and cardiovascular risk in black and white men will facilitate the design and timing of interventions to prevent adverse health consequences of early life experiences. This project will facilitate reaching two overarching goals of Healthy People 2020: a) achieving health equity and eliminating health disparities; and b) promoting healthy development and healthy behaviors across all life stages.              ","Early Life Adversity, Sleep, and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Men",8531339,R01HL111802,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence

"ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes have been observed across ethnic and gender groups which are not fully explained by consideration of traditional and novel CVD risk factors. For example, African Americans have a considerably higher prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure than Caucasians despite lipid patterns and coronary artery calcium levels that generally show relatively favorable distributions. However, only limited research has addressed the role of sleep disorders in influencing CVD in ethnic minorities despite evidence that sleep disorders disproportionately affect minority populations and, through pro-inflammatory or autonomic nervous system dysregulation, operate as risk factors for hypertension and CVD. In this proposed ancillary study to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we aim to perform standardized in-home polysomnography and 7-day wrist actigraphy in 2500 African American, Hispanic, Asian American and Caucasian individuals participating in MESA Exam 5 to derive indices of sleep apnea, quality, duration and timing. Newly collected sleep data will be rigorously standardized and comprehensively analyzed by a central Reading Center. By capitalizing on the rich clinical, physiological, anthropomorphic, and biochemical data collected longitudinally by MESA over 10 years, we will test the associations between indices of sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index, nocturnal hypoxemia), sleep duration and quality, slow wave activity, and circadian placement with the indices of CVD risk, subclinical CVD and clinical CVD as outcomes. Finally, we will quantify the extent to which sleep disorders and patterns account for previously observed variations in CVD among ethnic and sex groups. By defining the role of sleep disorders in CVD in ethnic minorities, these activities may direct future interventions directed at reducing ethnic disparities in chronic health conditions. Project Narrative  The proposed addition of objective measurements of sleep to MESA will fill an important gap in risk factor data in this unique cohort and allow the role of sleep disorders in atherosclerosis and CVD pathogenesis to be better defined, thus paving the way for important intervention studies that may improve health disparities in CVD.",ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH

"CVD in American Indians Genetics Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes. The proposed study will take advantage of the Strong Heart Study data in American Indians to further our understanding of CVD and its risk factors, especially diabetes and obesity, which will lead to more effective prevention and therapy and reduce the burden of CVD morbidity and mortality.            ",CVD in American Indians Genetics Center,8368983,R01HL109301,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', '

"CVD in American Indians Biomarker lab and Arizona Field Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD.

"Diet Quality and CVD Risk Factors in a Family Based Weight Management Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Family Weight Management Study (FamWtStudy) (1R18-DK075981) is designed to evaluate the effects of a 12-month, family-based intervention designed to improve BMI z-scores and CVD risk factors in children ages 7-12 years living in a community with a high minority representation, who have a BMI z-score >85th percentile.  The families recruited will be randomized to either the Control or Experimental Intervention group. The Control Intervention group will receive a booklet with targets for healthy eating behaviors, a handout on how to increase physical activity, and quarterly visits that will include a brief review of lifestyle recommendations. The Experimental Intervention group will receive weekly sessions for 3 months that include a core diet and physical activity curriculum followed by monthly post-core sessions for 9 months promoting adherence to the curriculum. Targeted diet strategies in the core curriculum include increasing highly pigmented fruit and vegetable, and fish intake; substituting non-fat and low-fat for full-fat milk and dairy products; and reducing meat, fried food and savory snack intakes. During the one-year intervention period social support and tailored individualized counseling will be provided to the families, augmented with telephone calls and home visits addressing barriers to adherence. The goal of this ancillary study application is to expand the scope of the FamWtStudy to include 1) measures of diet quality biomarkers in child-mother/female guardian pairs, 2) measures of CVD risk factors in children and mothers/female guardians, and 3) assessment of associations within child-mother/female guardian pairs for diet quality biomarkers and CVD risk factors pre-intervention and post-intervention change. Each biomarker for diet quality was chosen because it is an indicator of a different component of the diet targeted by the parent study and can provide an indication of adherence - red blood cell (RBC) 18:3n-3, 20:4n-6, 20:5n-3 and 22:6n-3 for vegetable oil, meat and fish; plasma carotenoids and phylloquinone for highly pigmented fruits and vegetables; RBC 15:0 for full-fat milk and dairy products; and RBC trans fatty acids and plasma dihydrophylloquinone for fried food and savory snacks. Measuring the CVD risk factors (total, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, hsCRP, glucose and insulin concentrations, blood pressure and waist circumference) in the children and mothers/female guardians, will allow for an assessment of 'spill-over' effect within families and concordance within child-mother/female guardian pairs. Regardless of the outcomes, the results will provide critical data with which to design subsequent interventions in minority communities to increase the impact of family-based obesity prevention programs and public health importance because the data will provide information in an area that continues to challenge current efforts to stem the tide of childhood obesity in a high-risk subgroup and an area that threatens to overwhelm our healthcare system. The response is time-sensitive because the FamWtStudy intervention started in August, 2009 and it is critical to have resources to collect, process, archive, transfer and analyze plasma and RBC samples.    Public Health Relevance:  The results of the proposed work will be of public health importance because they will provide objective measures for the effectiveness of a family-based program designed to prevent excess weight gain in high-risk children and potential 'spill-over' effects in the mothers/female guardians of the children. The objective measures will include indicators of diet quality and cardiovascular disease risk factors in the children and their mothers/female guardians, as well as the relationship of change within children and mothers/female guardian pairs. Developing and evaluating strategies to prevent excess weight gain is critical to support current efforts to stem the tide of childhood obesity in the U.S., a public health problem that threatens to overwhelm our healthcare system.

"Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self-management skills (TABLETS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though rates of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) have declined the risk of CVD events increased among those with diabetes. Clinical trials have shown behavioral lifestyle interventions are effective at decreasing CVD risk and decreasing CVD-related deaths among those with diabetes. Face-to-face interventions are labor and cost intensive, but may not be more effective than alternative modes of delivery, especially where access and transportation are a significant problem. Studies have shown that telephone- delivered interventions are effective but, more importantly, that patients likely prefer health education via a technology modality. The telephone (either landline or cell phone) is highly accessible for low-income populations. Yet, there is little data on the effectiveness of CVD risk reduction interventions using a novel tablet-based approach among high-risk, low-income African Americans (AA) with diabetes. This study will determine the effectiveness of a multi-component, Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self- management (TABLETS) intervention on changing behavioral (chronic disease self-management) and clinical outcomes (CVD risk) given the needs of a low-income minority population with diabetes at high risk for CVD. We propose a pilot randomized clinical trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-driven, multi- component TABLET intervention on improving behavioral outcomes (activity, diet, medication adherence, self-monitoring) and clinical outcomes in high-risk, low-income AAs with diabetes. The primary outcome is change in CVD risk behaviors at 6 months of follow-up and secondary outcomes are glycemic control (A1c), blood pressure, and lipids as well as quality of life. The proposed novel approach will maximize the effectiveness and impact of the intervention by implementing tablet-based videoconferencing as an enhancement of the intervention. This study targets a high-priority research area - disparate burden of type 2 diabetes, resulting from poor self- management. The long-term goal of this application is to test novel approaches to lifestyle behavior change that reduce CVD complications and mortality, and eliminate health disparities in high-risk, low-income AA adults with diabetes.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors show African Americans (AA) have up to a two-fold risk of poor control of glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids compared to Whites. Several studies have shown at least equivalent effectiveness of computer-aided, telehealth, and mobile-enabled interventions on improving chronic disease self-management. The proposed study is a logical progression of an earlier study and provides opportunity for the PI (a new, minority investigator) to extend the experience from the diversity supplement to CVD risk reduction in AAs with T2DM using novel technology. This study provides a unique opportunity to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-driven, Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self-management (TABLETS) in AAs with diabetes, using real-time videoconferencing technology for education and skills training, on chronic disease self-management behaviors and CVD risk among a high- risk, low-income AA population.

"Gender Race and Ethnic Disparities Research in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Gender and racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been well documented over the past decade of research. The applicant for renewal of a Midcareer Research Award, Dr. Lori Mosca, and many of her mentees, have contributed substantially to advancement of our knowledge in this field as a result of the initial K24 award, during which time Dr. Mosca was promoted to Professor of Medicine at Columbia University Medical Center. Substantial questions remain regarding the reasons for discrepancies in care and outcomes, a critical scientific gap that could inform interventions designed to reduce gender and racial/disparities in the prevention and treatment of CVD. The goal of this award is to provide the applicant with protected time to increase the pool of high quality multidisciplinary patient oriented researchers dedicated to a) understanding the independent contributions of gender and race/ethnicity to CVD outcomes and b) developing novel interventions targeted to modifiable factors that may reduce disparities. The award will also support the applicant's time to interact with and learn from other senior investigators with an interest in CVD disparities research, an appropriate and important commitment for her stage of career development. Extensive preliminary data by the applicant and her mentees has documented disparities in CVD awareness, risk factor control, and barriers to prevention. The proposed research provides a timely scientific opportunity to garner data from existing and ongoing studies uniquely suited to evaluate independent contributors to disparities and inform the design of future clinical trials and interventions aimed to reduce CVD disparities. The specific aims of the research include: 1) To examine the association between race/ethnic group and a) awareness of coronary heart disease as the leading cause of death in women, b) knowledge of heart attack symptoms and actions to take when experiencing heart attack symptoms, and c) perceptions of preventive/alternative therapies for coronary heart disease risk reduction, among nationally representative samples of women surveyed triennially from 1997-2009, 2) To determine whether the effectiveness of a screening and education program for family members of patients hospitalized with CVD to improve lifestyle factors over one year varies by race/ethnic group and to examine acculturation, baseline risk, and psychosocial factors as potential confounders/effect modifiers of program effectiveness and 3) To ascertain whether control of CVD risk factors is independently associated with race/ethnic group among consecutive patients admitted to the cardiovascular disease service line of a major medical center, and to determine whether the association with medication adherence and having a paid or non-paid (family member/friend) caregiver prior to hospitalization. The significance and impact of this research is that it will extend our knowledge about health disparities and will address the etiology of differential outcomes with the goal of developing effective interventions to optimize cardiovascular health among populations that bear a disproportionate burden of CVD risk.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  This purpose of this research is to contribute to a reduction in gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in cardiovascular disease prevention through innovative approaches to study the causes of health disparities and to use the knowledge gained to inform targeted educational programs and to design future clinical studies aimed to reduce disparities and improve cardiovascular health for all.

"CVD in American Indians  Study and Data Management Center and OK Field Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes. The proposed study will take advantage of the Strong Heart Study data in American Indians to further our understanding of CVD and its risk factors, especially diabetes and obesity, which will lead to more effective prevention and therapy and reduce the burden of CVD morbidity and mortality.            ",CVD in American Indians  Study and Data Management Center and OK Field

"Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States and disables 10 million Americans each year. However, CVD risk in the US is higher for African Americans (AAs) relative to European Americans (EAs). In addition to R/E differences in CVD risk, there is extensive data demonstrating that, relative to EAs, AAs have higher rates of poverty and a corresponding increase in exposure to environmental toxicants, including lead (Pb), both in their blood and in their bones. Moreover, studies suggest a positive association between Pb and blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and CVD mortality. The current proposal addresses the question of whether R/E differences in CVD are partially a consequence of corresponding differences in exposure to Pb from the environment. Furthermore, this proposal considers whether these effects might be amplified by R/E differences in psychosocial background, including social control motives, background stress, and racial discrimination. Specifically, our proposal focuses on whether R/E differences in Pb exposure might produce differing rates of CVD risk through underlying alterations in cardiovascular responses to acute psychological stress, a mechanism whereby the psychosocial environment can affect CVD risk. In recent research (Gump, et al., 2011), increasing blood Pb was associated with alterations in cardiac autonomic regulation reflecting ""co-inhibition"" of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity that is typically associated with greater vascular resistance, a cardiovascular pattern we had already observed in children with heightened early childhood blood Pb (Gump, et al., 2005). This vascular response to stress has also been shown to be associated with greater left ventricular mass, a significant predictor of cardiovascular morbidity. Interestingly, a number of studies have noted that AAs respond to psychological stress with a vascular pattern relative to EAs typical cardiac response and are more likely than EAs to develop left ventricular hypertrophy at similar levels of blood pressure, and have greater arterial stiffness as reflected by faster pulse wave velocity. In sum, there is evidence that: 1) AAs (relative to EAs) have higher levels of blood Pb, 2) AAs (relative to EAs) typically respond to stress with a more vascular pattern, as well as greater arterial stiffness and left ventricular mass, and 3) increasing Pb is associated with a heightened vascular response to acute stress. This accumulated evidence provides strong support for testing the hypothesis that R/E differences in Pb exposure might account for R/E differences in cardiovascular patterns of response to acute stress and R/E differences in left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease relative to European Americans, although the reason for this racial health disparity is not understood. Taken together, the racial disparity in lead (Pb) exposure and additional evidence for effects of Pb on cardiovascular functioning suggest a possible mechanism for differences in disease prevalence. As a method to understand the early antecedents of these racial disparities, children represent an important population in which to consider effects of Pb exposure on subclinical CVD outcomes.            ","Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children",8373250,R01ES023252,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' bone ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' hemodynamics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' K element ', ' Potassium ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Controls ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' United States ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pattern ', ' LV Mass ', ' Left Ventricular Mass ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohesion ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' early childhood ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Trace metal ', ' social ', ' acute stress ', ' Regulation ', ' blood Pb ', ' blood lead ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Sum ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NIEHS,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R01,2013,479495,0.10688881752909758
"Gender Disparities in Invasive CVD Procedure Use: the Role of Provider Bias PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  My long-term career goal is to become a nationally recognized independent investigator and expert in cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities with an emphasis on interventions designed to eliminate disparities. I have laid a strong foundation for reaching this goal by defining a broad mentoring network, obtaining formal training in health services research, and leading several research projects. To date, my research has primarily focused on describing gender disparities in CVD care. For example, I have shown that women with CVD receive fewer invasive procedures than men with CVD. Despite extensive research documenting these disparities, few have investigated their causes. I am committing my career to addressing this gap by conducting research aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind gender disparities to achieve my ultimate goal of instituting evidence-based interventions to reduce gender disparities in CVD care.    The Institute of Medicine has identified provider bias as a key contributor to disparities in health care. However, the role of provider bias in gender-based decisions surrounding the use of invasive CVD procedures is poorly characterized. In order to more accurately and fully measure provider attitudes, advanced qualitative and social psychology techniques must be employed; skills I wish to develop. Therefore, I seek a Career Development Award to allow me time and support to pursue mentored research aimed at measuring provider gender attitudes and training in the areas of qualitative research, social psychology and advanced biostatistical techniques. The proposed research and training are a crucial to move my research forward from defining gender disparities towards research aimed at understanding the causes of these disparities.    Although studies have implicated provider bias as the cause of gender disparities in CVD care, to our knowledge, no study has directly measured such attitudes using validated instruments. Tools have been developed in other fields that measure implicit (unconscious) gender attitudes such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). These tools have been widely used to explain gender differences in social outcomes including job promotions and performance evaluations, but they have not been widely applied to the study of health care disparities. Furthermore, these tools may need to be adapted to capture concepts specific to CVD care, such as a provider's belief about women's willingness to undergo invasive procedures or whether a provider views women as fragile and therefore more likely to have a complication from an invasive procedure. This gap in knowledge is a barrier to developing evidence-based interventions to address gender disparities.    The research objectives of this Career Development Award are to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes to apply to decisions concerning the use of invasive CVD procedures and to conduct preliminary tests of these adapted measures. The research will occur in three steps. For aim 1, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with cardiologists, using two case scenarios in which an invasive cardiac procedure might be recommended. These interviews will be used to determine providers' gender attitudes specific to invasive cardiac procedures, and the results will then be used to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes. Next, in aim 2, I will test the adapted measures within a second cohort of cardiologists to determine the relationship between measured attitudes and the providers' decision to use an invasive cardiac procedure with women and men in the standard case scenarios. Finally, in aim 3, I will conduct a study to test my ability to link the adapted measures results and the subject cardiologists' actual clinical decisions obtained from retrospective clinical data.    As a health services researcher, woman and practicing cardiologist, I am uniquely positioned to make important contributions to the field of gender disparities and CVD. I will bridge the fields of social psychology and health services research in order to gain a better understanding of potential contributors to gender disparities and plan for multimodal interventions aimed at reducing or eliminating disparities in CVD care. My extensive methodological training, research experience and proposed training activities make me ideally positioned to perform the proposed studies. Furthermore, the unique resources available at the University of Colorado Denver and its affiliated campuses will ensure my success towards these goals. Specifically, my mentorship team includes experts in health services and disparities research (Drs. Masoudi, Havranek, and Blair), measurement of explicit and implicit bias using social psychology experimental procedures (Dr. Blair), adaption of survey tools based on qualitative techniques (Dr. Main) and advanced hierarchical modeling (Dr. Dickinson). This qualified group of mentors and the training activities I propose will ensure my successful transition towards independence. Project Narrative  We know that women are less likely than men to get certain cardiology procedures. The purpose of this research project is to understand if health care providers' beliefs, or stereotypes, about the traits that women and men have potentially explain these differences.",Gender Disparities in Invasive CVD Procedure Use: the Role of Provider Bias,8514053,K08HL103776,"['angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Angiography ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Colorado ', ' Complication ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2013,131490,0.11365928591743057
"Social protection, work and family strain: disadvantage effects in US and Europe    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is losing ground in health: our ranking in life expectancy is near the bottom of European countries and comparisons of major chronic conditions in the US and 13 European countries showed the US to have higher disease prevalence than any comparison country. The diverging life expectancy (LE) trends have been most distinct for American women, but the US also fares poorly with regard to male life expectancy and infant mortality. The health gap is largest among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, but even well- educated Americans have worse health than many of Europeans. We hypothesize that the explanations for the American health disadvantage have roots in the challenging social context faced by families, and in particular women, in post-WWII America. Since WWII, American society has been marked by: high fertility; high female labor market participation; weak labor laws and family protection policies; and family instability, and increased single parenthood. The combination or convergence of these factors created a ""perfect storm"" that threatened vulnerable families and imposed extreme stresses even on the relatively advantaged. Such social conditions might work via influencing health behaviors or through more direct physiological mechanisms. We have developed a theoretical framework for this confluence of conditions that builds on the job strain models incorporating dimensions of demand, control and support but adds an important dimension related to family that extends the strain model beyond work to family life. Over time Americans, especially women, have experienced high demands in terms of full time work often with high family demands, coupled with low formal support ( social protection policies) or informal support from other family members. This combination especially among workers with low job control leads to a cumulative disadvantage taking its toll in health over time. In order to understand whether these social conditions account for cross area variations in risk we must understand whether either the distribution and/or the toxicity of the ""risk"" vary across areas. We draw from ongoing studies including HRS, SHARE and ELSA, mortality data at a country level (using the human mortality files) and data on public policies, collected from the CPS,SIPP and SHARELIFE and OECD. We propose 4 specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the distribution of work-family strain for females born 1920-1960, across the US and EU. Aim 2: Assess the differential toxicity of work-family strain on CVD risk behaviors and biomarkers, incidence of stroke and heart disease, CVD mortality, and life expectancy in the US and Europe. Aim 3: Assess whether distributions or the toxicity of work-family strain explain geographic and temporal variations in CVD and life expectancy. Aim 4: Assess impacts of trends in work-family strain on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in the US and Europe.        With the vast majority of women in the labor force who also have young children and with the aging of societies virtually across the globe, there is an urgent public health need to provide both formal (policy) and informal (family) support to women and their families. Evidence suggests that work family strain has an adverse impact on health outcomes for low wage employees and young children and perhaps other groups. Countries in which a number of work family policies have been implemented seem to fewer adverse population health outcomes. This situation is particularly severe in the US where fertility and labor force participation among women is high and where state and federal policies promoting the health of families is very limited.

We have 4 specific aims. 1) We will recruit and follow for 2 years a COHORT of 2,500 individuals, age 21-I-, 18% African-American and 10% Hispanic, at the time of their discharge from an ACS hospitalization at 8 medical centers in Massachusetts and Georgia. We will abstract medical records from the index and subsequent hospitalizations and outpatient records. Patient interviews at the time of discharge and at 2 and 6 weeks, and 3, 12, and 24 months later will include measurements of quality of life (QoL), cognitive impairment, adherence to medications, and health related behaviors. 2) TRANSITIONS PROJECT: We will characterize the 90-day transition process for patients discharged after an ACS. We will engage a national panel to develop an evidence-based Transition Measurement Set reflecting the first 90 days after discharge and going beyond existing systems that focus on the discharge process. We will test hypotheses on the associations between quality of care and outcomes (including rehospitalization and QoL), particularly as they pertain to health disparities. 3) ACTION SCORES PROJECT: We will develop and validate two novel ""Action Scores"" that predict clinical events/mortality and QoL and which emphasize modifiable aspects of health care delivery and patient behaviors. 4) Using TRACE-CORE as a training laboratory, we will develop the CVD outcomes research careers of the four ESIs. This will include structured mentoring, key involvement of the ESIs astheco-PIs in the research projects, and preparation of new research proposals based on the TRACE-CORE infrastructure and findings. Our team involves prominent CVD outcomes researchers, methodologists, cardiologists, and other clinicians. Our innovative Action Scores should activate patients and providers to improve CVD outcomes; our Transitions Project will fill important knowledge gaps. Future studies will benefit from our data, infrastructure, Action Scores, and transition measures; building on these will also underpin the careers of future CVD outcomes researchers.

"Racial/Ethnic Differences in 25(OH)D and PTH Levels and CVD among Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent report on vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted the need for further research to clarify the optimal levels of vitamin D for nonskeletal outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to assess whether the relationships vary by race/ethnicity. Observational studies have suggested interrelationships between low 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH) D], high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and increased risk of CVD. Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), the major vitamin D carrier protein, plays a key role in regulating vitamin D bioavailability and could potentially be a predictor of CVD events or an effect modifier of the relation between 25(OH) D and/or PTH and CVD. Vitamin D metabolites are mostly bound to VDBP and albumin, and it is possible that the free, unbound portions of vitamin D metabolites are the most biologically active and therefore most relevant for CVD risk prediction. However, no studies have specifically assessed the association between free or bioavailable 25(OH) D levels and CVD. Available evidence on total 25(OH)D levels and cardiovascular health also remains inconsistent and inconclusive, and few studies have had sufficient size and racial/ethnic diversity to examine these relationships across a broad range of circulating 25(OH)D levels. Clearly, there is a clinical and public health need to determine whether the relationships between vitamin D biomarkers and CVD vary by race/ethnicity and whether such differences can help to explain racial/ethnic disparities in CVD risk. The Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS), one of the largest and most racially/ethnically diverse cohorts of postmenopausal women with comprehensive information on CVD risk factors, intermediate phenotypes, and outcomes, offers a unique and cost-effective opportunity to answer important and timely questions about racial/ethnic differences in vitamin D biomarkers with regard to CVD risk. We propose to conduct a prospective case-cohort study in the WHI-OS to assess racial/ethnic differences in the associations of total and free 25(OH)D, VDBP, and PTH levels with major cardiovascular events (a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], nonfatal stroke, and CVD mortality). We will include all incident CVD cases in African-American (black) women (N=650) and a random sample of incident CVD cases in white women (N=1,500). Noncases will be drawn from a random subcohort of black (N=1,300) and white women (N=1,500) in the WHI-OS. In addition, we will examine whether total and free 25(OH)D, VDBP, and PTH levels correlate with a variety of intermediate CVD phenotypes, including directly measured anthropometric indices, blood pressure, lipids, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, glycemic status, insulin resistance, insulin secretion, and renal function. In summary, the WHI-OS provides an exceptional opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the full spectrum of variation in levels of total and free 25(OH) D, VDBP, and PTH and to examine their potential independent and joint contributions to racial/ethnic disparities in CVD risk among postmenopausal women.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The recent report on vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted the need for further research to clarify the optimal levels of vitamin D for nonskeletal outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to assess whether the relationships vary by race/ethnicity.

"Sociocultural Factors and Cardiometabolic Risk in Mexican-American Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mexican Americans display elevated social (e.g., low socioeconomic status; SES) and metabolic (e.g., obesity; metabolic syndrome; MetSyn) risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mexican-American women also evidence a high burden of obesity (45% versus 33%) and MetSyn (42% versus 32%) when compared to non-Latino white women. Women are more vulnerable than men to low SES, stress, and negative emotions, and Mexican American women may experience additional psychosocial risks specific to their sociocultural milieu. Very few prospective studies have examined SES, psychosocial and behavioral factors, and cardiometabolic risk progression over time, particularly in high-risk ethnic minority populations. This competing renewal application builds on 1R01HL081604, which enrolled 304 SES-diverse, randomly selected Mexican-American women (aged 40-65 years) from South San Diego communities to participate in a rigorous, multi-method assessment of socioeconomic and psychosocial factors, lifestyle pathways, and established CVD risk factors (e.g., blood pressure, lipids, obesity, fasting glucose levels), novel inflammatory biomarkers, and ambulatory blood pressure (AmBP) levels and diurnal rhythm. Guided by the Reserve Capacity Model, which highlights psychosocial risk (stress, negative emotions) and protective factors (inter- and intra-personal resources, i.e., ""reserve capacity"") in SES disparities, the study has identified SES gradients in MetSyn variables, inflammatory markers, and AmBP levels and nocturnal dipping in Latinas, and has shown that psychosocial (negative emotions, resources) and behavioral factors (obesity, diet) contribute to these gradients. Findings also reveal variability in SES gradients by acculturation (defined by language preference) and suggest the need to look beyond traditional psychosocial factors to better understand cardiometabolic risk in Mexican-American women. The current study proposes a 6-yr follow-up assessment (Time 2; expected N=280) to examine predictors of cardiometabolic risk progression in the Nuestra Salud cohort. In addition to re-examining Time 1 indicators, the Time 2 protocol will add new measures of culturally driven psychosocial factors and objective measures of physical activity and sleep to examine their contributions to cardiometabolic risk progression and its social patterning in Mexican American women. Community based participatory research strategies will inform project implementation and ensure representation of psychosocial issues most relevant to Mexican American women. The overarching aim of the study is to examine associations among SES, traditional and culturally driven psychosocial risk and protective factors, lifestyle factors, and 6-yr cardiometabolic risk progression, via structural equation models guided by a culturally enhanced Reserve Capacity Model. The study will advance understanding of modifiable psychosocial and behavioral risk and protective factors that shape cardiometabolic risk progression and its social patterning in Mexican American women, to provide a basis for culturally appropriate strategies to improve health in this at-risk, underserved, and growing U.S. population subgroup.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Little is known about how socioeconomic status (e.g., income), stress, emotions, relationships, and culture affect health in Mexican-Americans, the largest subgroup in the rapidly growing U.S. Latino population. The proposed research will examine how such variables affect cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in Mexican- American women. The research will help identify modifiable factors that protect or augment risk for CVD, thereby providing a basis for the development of culturally-competent programs and policy strategies to improve health and reduce disparities in this underserved Latino subgroup.

"Effects of Yoga on CVD Risk Factors among African Americans: Jackson Heart Study    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S. and continues to be one of the nation's largest racial health disparity conditions: compared to non-Hispanic whites, African Americans are 30 percent more likely to die from heart disease and 60 percent more likely to die from a stroke. African Americans are also more likely than whites to have risk factors for CVD, such as hypertension and elevated levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and HbA1c. Clinical studies of the effects of yoga on mitigating CVD risk factors, although small in nature, have demonstrated promising results. The proposed study, which utilizes a randomized, hybrid phase-in/cross- over design, includes 500 adult hypertensive or pre-hypertensive African American participants from the Jackson Heart Study to test the effect of yoga classes three times per week for 12 weeks on CVD risk factors. The three specific aims of the study are to measure the effect yoga can have on (1) risks for CVD, including hypertension, inflammation, and elevated levels of lipids and hemoglobin A1c; (2) perceived levels of stress; and (3) health behaviors and health-related quality of life. Primary outcomes will be changes in participants' systolic and diastolic blood pressure and their levels of CRP, fibrinogen, homocysteine, and interleukin-6. Secondary outcomes will be changes in participants' levels of HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and fasting triglycerides; their perceived levels of stress; and their reported health behaviors and health-related quality of life. Because of the number of participants and the rigor of the research design, this study will be the first of its kind. The study team is in the fortunate position to be able to recruit and retain a large number of participants because of its longstanding-and remarkably close-relationship through their joint association with the Jackson Heart Study. Results will be disseminated on a large scale to a variety of professional and lay audiences. If the results of the intervention yield statistically significant improvement in individuals' CVD risk factors, the nation will benefit from an easily replicable model that can be used to help reduce CVD risk.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:    Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., and African Americans have higher rates of heart disease and their risk factors than do whites. We want to see if practicing yoga three times a week can help reduce risk factors for heart disease in African Americans. If we find out that it does, then we can provide the nation with an inexpensive way in which to help improve heart health.

"Center for Reduce CVD Disparities: Genes, Clinics, and Communities Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affect low income and minority populations. Lenoir County, North Carolina is among the poorest in the state and situated in the ""stroke belt"" with significantly elevated heart disease, stroke, and obesity rates relative to state levels already well above the national average. At the same time, this county is home to many clinical and public health efforts on which to build. We propose an integrated set of three interdisciplinary studies in Lenoir County to: 1) determine genetic factors associated with CVD risk; 2) understand the multilevel determinants of poor health outcomes and the potential social and community capital that can support sustainable change; 3) work with community leaders, health professionals, and citizens to apply these understandings to improved practice-based management of hypertension and community-centered lifestyle management, and test the impact on improving outcomes and reducing disparities in cardiovascular health among 700 participants. This will include an innovative partnership with a nonprofit call center, Connect Inc, adding a lifestyle and medication adherence coaching component to their current focus on jobs, employment, and benefits counseling; 4) test the impact, reach, adoption, and sustainability of clinical, community-level, and policy interventions , including economic development potential; and 5) develop and implement strategies for translation and dissemination of the clinic-based and community-level interventions to other underserved regions. This work will be supported by an administrative core housed in the Center for Health Promotion and Disease Prevention (a CDC funded Prevention Research Center with a focus on community-based participatory research). Additional cores include: 1) a Genomic Bioinformatics Core available to this project and other PSO programs to analyze genetic/genomic data and other pathways of interest; and 2) a Social Determinants/Economic Development/Dissemination Core to understand the interface between poverty and health, and explore strategies with the potential to create jobs while promoting health.

"The Taxi Network     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are over 230,000 taxi drivers in the U.S. and 42,000 in New York City (NYC), where 84% are immigrant. Taxi drivers are at great risk for poor health, with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) and overlapping cancer risk, due to stress, diet, sedentary lifestyle, environmental exposures, and poor health care access. The taxi driver community, while facing tremendous health risk, also has notable assets to facilitate the health of its drivers. Community networks have the potential to disseminate health risk reduction information and strategies. The overall goal of this Taxi Network proposal is to create a robust community- based participatory research (CBPR) infrastructure that taps into the many assets of the taxi driver community, to work towards the elimination of health disparities in this large a-risk group. The specific aims include: 1. To develop a robust, enduring, fluid CBPR program with the large NYC taxi driver community, co- led by community and scientific research partners, with an active Taxi CAB (Community Advisory/Action Board), and Advisory and Steering Committees, to create a platform for co-learning, sharing resources and dissemination of outreach, education, service delivery, research, and policy action projects, to improve the cardiovascular health of this large at-risk community. 2. To work with the Taxi CAB to use a mixed methods approach of focus groups, key informant interviews, questionnaires, social network analysis, and resource mapping to conduct a detailed analysis of the health-related priorities, needs and assets of the taxi driver community, and the potential points and methods of intervention. 3.To design and pilot a CBPR CVD risk reduction pedometer exercise study, tailored to reflect the unique circumstances of the taxi driver community and capitalizing on assets such as their social networks and the window of opportunity of the airport holding lot. Taxi Network has been developed through an ongoing, iterative process with the community, and builds upon extensive preliminary work in this area.         RELEVANCE (See instructions): This Taxi Network CBPR program has the potential to significantly change the paradigm of health care delivery and cardiovascular disease prevention activities for the large, growing at-risk taxi driver population in NYC, across the nation, and globally.                  ",The Taxi Network,8500854,R24MD008058,"['driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Awareness ', ' Bangladesh ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Dominican Republic ', ' Ecuador ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Ethiopia ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Fear ', ' Fright ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Crickets ', ' Gryllidae ', ' Haiti ', ' Health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' elevated triglyceride ', ' elevated tg ', ' Triglycerides high ', ' Triglyceride increased ', ' Raised triglycerides ', ' Raised TG ', ' Hyperglyceridemia ', ' Hypertriglyceridemia ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' India ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Interview ', ' Jamaica ', ' Japan ', ' Learning ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' alpha-Lipoproteins ', ' High density lipoprotein ', ' Heavy Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Lipoproteins ', ' HDL ', ' High Density Lipoproteins ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Mexico ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Nepal ', ' New York City ', ' Nigeria ', ' Professional Postions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Pakistan ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Restaurants ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Safety ', ' San Francisco ', ' Smoking ', ' Soccer ', ' Ceylon ', ' Sri Lanka ', ' Stress ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Union of Soviet Socialist Republics ', ' Soviet Union ', ' USSR ', ' Vendor ', ' Work ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' sedentary ', ' Physical activity ', ' teacher ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Immigrant ', ' news ', ' Community Networks ', ' liquid ', ' fluid ', ' Liquid substance ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' cancer risk ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' experience ', ' trafficking ', ' Prevention ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Sampling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Policy Research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' South Asian ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Process ', ' informant ', ' Instruction ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' community based participatory research ', ' screening ', ' ']",NIMHD,SLOAN-KETTERING INST CAN RESEARCH,R24,2013,393589,0.06369144944640125
"Childhood SES Factors: Impact on age-related cognitive and vascular health    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): U.S. blacks have a life expectancy that is significantly shorter than whites, with a larger difference between men than women. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the single largest contributor to this disparity. Geographic disparities in health are similar to racial disparities in magnitude and effect. There is growing recognition that there are shared risk factors for CVD and cognitive impairment. Much of the research attempting to explain these racial and geographic disparities in health has focused on the participant's socioeconomic status (SES) or place of residence at the time of diagnosis or death. Increasing evidence, however, points to an important role of exposures during earlier lifecourse periods. The role of lifecourse exposures is difficult to study, however, because migration patterns obscure the links between geographic exposures and long- term health outcomes. The general aim of this study is to identify childhood and family SES factors (CH-SES) that shape disparities in vascular and cognitive health. Designed to determine the causes of racial and geographic differences in stroke incidence, mortality and cognitive decline, the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study is a national population-based cohort study. REGARDS recruited 30,239 participants aged 45 or older, from 2003-2007, 45% men, 42% blacks. Data were collected using a combination of telephone interview, in-home physical exam, and self-administered questionnaire. Participants are currently being followed for CVD events and cognitive assessments. Our approach builds on the exceptional resources in REGARDS, in particular, the detailed residential history data. This study proposes to obtain data on CH-SES factors from three sources: 1) new data collected from the cohort via a mail-questionnaire; 2) linking existing REGARDS data on childhood residence to public Census data on family and community level SES conditions; and 3) linking existing REGARDS data on childhood residence to historic public school records on school quality at the county/school district level. These data on CH-SES will be linked to the detailed data on demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort and examined as predictors of CVD and cognitive decline over follow-up.        This research focuses on the contribution of social factors to geographic and racial disparities in cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment. Differences in social conditions across the lifecourse confound black-white and regional comparisons where childhood exposures probably influence associations between adult exposures and health outcomes.

"Dietary Flavonoids in Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death since 1935 and it is anticipated that by 2030, about 40% of the US population will suffer from some type of cardiovascular disease. The burden of cognitive decline, which has been linked to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, is also expected to rise as the US population ages. Cardiovascular disease risk factors present in midlife have been associated with cognitive decline in older ages. Inflammatory and oxidative processes have been proposed as underlying mechanisms that may link CVD and cognitive decline. Measures that can protect against or mitigate CVD and cognitive decline are of great importance to public health. Diets high in plant-based foods, such as the Mediterranean diet, have been associated with a lower incidence of acute coronary heart disease, stroke events, and cognitive impairment. Flavonoids, which are bioactive, non-nutrient, polyphenolic compounds found in vascular plants, may explain some of the protective effects of plant-based diets. Several protective mechanisms have been proposed, based on the pleiotropic nature of flavonoids, which include antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Previous epidemiologic studies have yielded mixed evidence regarding the strength of the association between increased flavonoid intake and cardiovascular health. The overarching goal of this research proposal is to evaluate the role of dietary flavonoids in the development of CVD and cognitive impairment. Using data from the REasons for Geographic and Regional Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study (n=30,0000), we will evaluate the association between dietary flavonoid intake and incident CVD and incident cognitive impairment. Using data from the Mental Stress Ischemia: Prognosis and Genetic Influences (MIPS) study (n=650), we will evaluate the association between dietary flavonoid intake and recurrent CVD. Results from the proposed research will clarify the role of dietary flavonoids in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease. Also, the results will address gaps in knowledge about the associations of interest in non-Hispanic black populations. This information will be useful in public health interventions seeking to reduce CVD burden and disparities in CVD disease.           PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative Diets high in fruits, vegetables and other foods from plant sources, like tea and tofu, are linked to fewer heart attacks, strokes and less cognitive decline. Eating more flavonoids, which are naturally produced by plants that we eat, may explain why plant-based foods are protective, but scientific evidence to support this is still inconclusive, especially in males and non-Hispanic blacks in the United States. This study seeks to clarify whether eating more flavonoids provides protection against first and recurrent heart disease and strokes as well as protection against cognitive decline in the United States.            ",Dietary Flavonoids in Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health,8784895,F31AG048719,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Antioxidants ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Food ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Learning ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Food Plants ', ' Edible Plants ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Tea ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Tofu ', ' Soy Bean Curd ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' 2-Phenyl-Chromenes ', ' 2-Phenyl-Benzopyrans ', ' Flavonoids ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' regional difference ', ' Tracheophyta ', ' Higher Plants ', ' Vascular Plant ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Mediterranean Diet ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Plant Sources ', ' Supplementation ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Cognitive ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Dietary Flavonoid ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' LDL oxidation ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein oxidation ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' protective effect ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2014,42676,0.052115545542061076
"Center for Reduce CVD Disparities: Genes, Clinics, and Communities Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) disproportionately affect low income and minority populations. Lenoir County, North Carolina is among the poorest in the state and situated in the ""stroke belt"" with significantly elevated heart disease, stroke, and obesity rates relative to state levels already well above the national average. At the same time, this county is home to many clinical and public health efforts on which to build. We propose an integrated set of three interdisciplinary studies in Lenoir County to: 1) determine genetic factors associated with CVD risk; 2) understand the multilevel determinants of poor health outcomes and the potential social and community capital that can support sustainable change; 3) work with community leaders, health professionals, and citizens to apply these understandings to improved practice-based management of hypertension and community-centered lifestyle management, and test the impact on improving outcomes and reducing disparities in cardiovascular health among 700 participants. This will include an innovative partnership with a nonprofit call center, Connect Inc, adding a lifestyle and medication adherence coaching component to their current focus on jobs, employment, and benefits counseling; 4) test the impact, reach, adoption, and sustainability of clinical, community-level, and policy interventions , including economic development potential; and 5) develop and implement strategies for translation and dissemination of the clinic-based and community-level interventions to other underserved regions.

"Early Life Adversity, Sleep, and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Men     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Black men suffer disproportionately from premature mortality and cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to their white counterparts, perhaps in part due to blacks' greater exposure to social and economic adversity across the life span as suggested by the weathering hypothesis. This application suggests that (a) black-white differences in CVD in adulthood stem from cumulative adversity correlated with race much earlier in life; and (b) early life exposures at the individual, family, and neighborhood level mus be considered simultaneously. Not emphasized in the weathering hypothesis is that intra- and inter-personal and cultural resources also may accumulate over the life course (labeled reserve capacity) and moderate effects of early life adversity; and that there may also be a critical perio exposure to adverse life events. Sleep may be an important factor here because of its likely relation to race and socioeconomic status (SES), and possibly to CVD events. This application focuses on the developmental antecedents of sleep, optimal cardiovascular (CV) health (defined by AHA criteria), and CVD risk in a population-based study of middle-aged black and white men who have been followed since they were enrolled in the first grade. They have been assessed repeatedly for health behaviors and academic and social competence; parent health behaviors, parenting practices, and household SES; and neighborhood characteristics, including census track SES, violence exposure, and community cohesiveness and involvement; these measures have been summarized into developmentally appropriate periods. In 300 men now in their late thirties, we propose to collect measures of CV biomarkers and psychosocial risk factors and sleep to test the following: 1) the extent of black/white differences in sleep, optimal CV health, and CVD risk, and sleep; 2) whether early adverse family and neighborhood environments, particularly during adolescence, predict adult optimal CV health, CVD risk, and sleep; and 3) if reserve capacity reduces the impact of early adverse environments. Knowledge gained from this project may identify the early life experiences and their timing that render black men particularly vulnerable to later CVD.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the developmental antecedents of poor sleep and cardiovascular risk in black and white men will facilitate the design and timing of interventions to prevent adverse health consequences of early life experiences. This project will facilitate reaching two overarching goals of Healthy People 2020: a) achieving health equity and eliminating health disparities; and b) promoting healthy development and healthy behaviors across all life stages.","Early Life Adversity, Sleep, and Cardiovascular Risk in Black and White Men",8708191,R01HL111802,"['Accounting ', ' teenage ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' 12-20

"Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self-management skills (TABLETS)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though rates of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) have declined the risk of CVD events increased among those with diabetes. Clinical trials have shown behavioral lifestyle interventions are effective at decreasing CVD risk and decreasing CVD-related deaths among those with diabetes. Face-to-face interventions are labor and cost intensive, but may not be more effective than alternative modes of delivery, especially where access and transportation are a significant problem. Studies have shown that telephone- delivered interventions are effective but, more importantly, that patients likely prefer health education via a technology modality. The telephone (either landline or cell phone) is highly accessible for low-income populations. Yet, there is little data on the effectiveness of CVD risk reduction interventions using a novel tablet-based approach among high-risk, low-income African Americans (AA) with diabetes. This study will determine the effectiveness of a multi-component, Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self- management (TABLETS) intervention on changing behavioral (chronic disease self-management) and clinical outcomes (CVD risk) given the needs of a low-income minority population with diabetes at high risk for CVD. We propose a pilot randomized clinical trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-driven, multi- component TABLET intervention on improving behavioral outcomes (activity, diet, medication adherence, self-monitoring) and clinical outcomes in high-risk, low-income AAs with diabetes. The primary outcome is change in CVD risk behaviors at 6 months of follow-up and secondary outcomes are glycemic control (A1c), blood pressure, and lipids as well as quality of life. The proposed novel approach will maximize the effectiveness and impact of the intervention by implementing tablet-based videoconferencing as an enhancement of the intervention. This study targets a high-priority research area - disparate burden of type 2 diabetes, resulting from poor self- management. The long-term goal of this application is to test novel approaches to lifestyle behavior change that reduce CVD complications and mortality, and eliminate health disparities in high-risk, low-income AA adults with diabetes.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors show African Americans (AA) have up to a two-fold risk of poor control of glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids compared to Whites. Several studies have shown at least equivalent effectiveness of computer-aided, telehealth, and mobile-enabled interventions on improving chronic disease self-management. The proposed study is a logical progression of an earlier study and provides opportunity for the PI (a new, minority investigator) to extend the experience from the diversity supplement to CVD risk reduction in AAs with T2DM using novel technology. This study provides a unique opportunity to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-driven, Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self-management (TABLETS) in AAs with diabetes, using real-time videoconferencing technology for education and skills training, on chronic disease self-management behaviors and CVD risk among a high- risk, low-income AA population.

"Boston Puerto Rican Health Study - CVD Risk Factors Puerto Rican adults living on the mainland US have documented health disparities; however, little research has been conducted with this second largest Hispanic subgroup. Our long-term goal is to understand the complex interactions of diet and other behavioral and environmental factors, genetics, and psychosocial stress on the high and apparently increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in Puerto Rican adults. As this group is rapidly growing, understanding the reasons for this risk is of great importance. Our initial funding period for the Boston Puerto Rican Center on Population Health and Health Disparities (BPR-CPHHD, 2003-08) focused on the role of stress on physical disability and cognitive decline, through physiological dysregulation or ""allostatic load."" During that investigation, it became clear that risk factors for CVD were highly prevalent. These findings are in contrast to the commonly held belief that there is a Hispanic paradox¿lower heart disease and mortality despite greater poverty. Importantly, the Puerto Rican population differs considerably in ancestral genetic history and in exposures to known risk factors from other Hispanic groups. They have unique dietary intake patterns, as well as social, cultural and environmental structures that contribute and affect reaction to stressors. During our initial funding period, we successfully assembled a cohort of 1450 Puerto Rican adults, aged 45-75 years at baseline, and have completed (to date) more than 900 two-year follow-up interviews¿we are continuing, with the expectation of completing at least 1150. As this population is aging and growing rapidly, the high prevalence and apparent cohort effect of increased heart disease risk factors suggest that 1) this population has serious health disparities in heart disease risk factors and 2) heart disease will become an even greater problem for this group in the near future. Our overall aim for this renewal is, therefore, to extend follow-up and to measure and analyze relevant characteristics and CVD risk factors, and to add additional contextual and outcome measures for CVD risk in this established cohort of Puerto Rican adults, so that we may better understand the dynamics of these disparities. Our model follows the transdisciplinary ""cells to society"" concept developed jointly with our partner CPHHDs during the initial funding period, with consideration of genetic variation in relation to longitudinal change in allostatic load and biochemical indicators of risk, to more concrete indicators of disease (ankle brachial index (ABI) and intima media thickness (IMT)); with additional focus on social networks, neighborhood characteristics (physical space and access to food) and environment (air pollution) factors as social determinants of health. Finally, using community based participatory techniques, we will implement and test a multidimensional intervention that focuses on diet and exercise, but that also fully considers the social and physical environment to ensure success. With participation of our community partner. La Alianza Hispana, and the support of our administrative, biostatistics and laboratory cores, our team is efficiently poised to make significant contributions to understanding the factors that contribute to the apparent growing threat of heart disease in this highly disadvantaged group¿while providing insights that may be useful to other vulnerable groups. The continuation of our cohort, with its rich constellation of measures, will allow us to unravel some of the complex etiologic interactions which contribute to CVD risk, so that effective interventions maybe implemented. This work takes the innovative and necessary approach of examining complex interactions of physiological measures, biological stress, and psychosocial evaluation on multiple levels to understand the causes of disproportionate health disparities in Puerto Ricans.

"Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Risk for CVD and Stroke in the Jackson Heart Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite national initiatives to address health disparities, African Americans (AAs) suffer higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially stroke, than European Americans (EAs). The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was established in 2000 with the aim of generating data that would support public health recommendations for reducing CVD disparities in AAs. This landmark study has reported a higher prevalence of diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension in this entirely AA cohort compared to other U.S. mostly EA cohorts. Increased risk factor prevalence is not explained by obesity or other traditional risk factors, suggesting a potential role for additional unmeasured factors in influencing adverse cardio- metabolic outcomes. Although JHS has comprehensively assessed a wide variety of CVD risk factors, a notable gap has been the absences of objective assessment of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep patterns. The importance of rectifying this gap is underscored by recent research from predominantly EA samples that have demonstrated that SDB and insufficient sleep each are associated with increased incidence of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Our preliminary data also indicate that SDB may be more prevalent in the entirely AA JHS cohort than in predominantly white cohorts. Our long-range goal is to ameliorate CVD disparities by identifying ethnicity-specific modifiable risk factors. The proposed study will examine relationships among SDB, insufficient sleep, obesity, psycho- socio-cultural variables, and CVD risk factors in 1,200 members of the JHS cohort. Sleep apnea and sleep patterns will be objectively assessed using low burden but reliable in-home sleep apnea monitoring and wrist actigraphy. To assess intermediate measurements of CVD, particularly related to stroke and diabetes, intimal media thickness (IMT), blood pressure, and biochemical indices of glucose control and inflammation will be obtained using rigorous protocols. These data will be used to achieve three specific aims: (1) Identify risk factors for SDB and insufficient sleep in AAs, including novel measurements of major and minor stress and negative emotions relevant to minority populations; (2) Elucidate relationships between SDB severity, insufficient sleep, and risk for uncontrolled hypertension, stroke and diabetes; and (3) Quantify the extent to which SDB may statistically mediate relationships between obesity and traditional CVD risk factors. Our study will identify the role of sleep disorders as novel modifiabe risk factors for CVD in AAs, provide a basis for promoting better screening for SDB, and enhance scientific understanding of how disparities in stroke and intermediate CVD outcomes such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are impacted by sleep disorders. Finally, the results of our study will serve as the foundation for prospective analyses linking SDB to incident CVD events, morbidity, and mortality in AAs.          The proposed study will help us better understand how sleep disorders and too little sleep contribute to the risk for stroke, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in African Americans. The data gathered by this study will help researchers develop future targeted health interventions to reduce the public health burden of cardiovascular disease and racial disparities in diabetes, hypertension and stroke.

"Marital Trajectories and Cardiovascular Disease in the United States     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes an innovative interdisciplinary project that will advance our understanding of how marital factors impact the development and progression of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in U.S. older adults. The research will provide the first comprehensive examination of the associations between the major dimensions of marital trajectories (marital status, timing, sequencing, transitions, and durations) and CVD incidence and mortality using a life course framework that combines conceptual breadth and empirical specificity. The primary aims of this research are threefold: First, to examine the associations between time- varying marital trajectory components and incident cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction [MI] and stroke). Bivariate and multivariate analyses will provide some of the first evidence of whether and to what extent past and present marital experiences precipitate acute MI and stroke in men and women. Second, examine the associations between the marital components and mortality (all-cause and CVD-specific) after MI and stroke. The secondary set of analyses will demonstrate the degree to which marital factors influence survival after a major cardiovascular event. Third, investigate the socioeconomic, psychosocial, behavioral, and physiological mechanisms linking marital trajectories to CVD incidence and mortality. The hypothesized mechanisms will be assessed independently, additively, and multiplicatively as time-varying risks to determine whether they are operating as mediators and/or moderators of marital differences in rates of morbidity and mortality. Drawing from cumulative disadvantage theory, the general hypothesis is that the accumulation of risks and acceleration of cardiovascular aging will be greatest among persons with the least exposure to marriage and most marital instability. The analyses will be based on more than 50 years of prospective and retrospective data from a nationally representative biennial panel (1992-2010) of older adults and will use a variety of age-based methods to elucidate how the multidimensional time-varying effects of marital history impact risks for a major CVD event and subsequent survival. The proposed R03 research will address a significant gap in our understanding of how a major social institution impacts human health and will provide new insights that will advance the interdisciplinary study of CVD. Understanding social disparities in CVD and reducing the excess burden of disease in vulnerable segments of the population are major goals of Healthy People 2020 and the National Institute on Aging.

"Gender Disparities in Invasive CVD Procedure Use: the Role of Provider Bias PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  My long-term career goal is to become a nationally recognized independent investigator and expert in cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities with an emphasis on interventions designed to eliminate disparities. I have laid a strong foundation for reaching this goal by defining a broad mentoring network, obtaining formal training in health services research, and leading several research projects. To date, my research has primarily focused on describing gender disparities in CVD care. For example, I have shown that women with CVD receive fewer invasive procedures than men with CVD. Despite extensive research documenting these disparities, few have investigated their causes. I am committing my career to addressing this gap by conducting research aimed at understanding the mechanisms behind gender disparities to achieve my ultimate goal of instituting evidence-based interventions to reduce gender disparities in CVD care.    The Institute of Medicine has identified provider bias as a key contributor to disparities in health care. However, the role of provider bias in gender-based decisions surrounding the use of invasive CVD procedures is poorly characterized. In order to more accurately and fully measure provider attitudes, advanced qualitative and social psychology techniques must be employed; skills I wish to develop. Therefore, I seek a Career Development Award to allow me time and support to pursue mentored research aimed at measuring provider gender attitudes and training in the areas of qualitative research, social psychology and advanced biostatistical techniques. The proposed research and training are a crucial to move my research forward from defining gender disparities towards research aimed at understanding the causes of these disparities.    Although studies have implicated provider bias as the cause of gender disparities in CVD care, to our knowledge, no study has directly measured such attitudes using validated instruments. Tools have been developed in other fields that measure implicit (unconscious) gender attitudes such as the Implicit Association Test (IAT). These tools have been widely used to explain gender differences in social outcomes including job promotions and performance evaluations, but they have not been widely applied to the study of health care disparities. Furthermore, these tools may need to be adapted to capture concepts specific to CVD care, such as a provider's belief about women's willingness to undergo invasive procedures or whether a provider views women as fragile and therefore more likely to have a complication from an invasive procedure. This gap in knowledge is a barrier to developing evidence-based interventions to address gender disparities.    The research objectives of this Career Development Award are to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes to apply to decisions concerning the use of invasive CVD procedures and to conduct preliminary tests of these adapted measures. The research will occur in three steps. For aim 1, I will conduct semi-structured interviews with cardiologists, using two case scenarios in which an invasive cardiac procedure might be recommended. These interviews will be used to determine providers' gender attitudes specific to invasive cardiac procedures, and the results will then be used to adapt existing measures of gender attitudes. Next, in aim 2, I will test the adapted measures within a second cohort of cardiologists to determine the relationship between measured attitudes and the providers' decision to use an invasive cardiac procedure with women and men in the standard case scenarios. Finally, in aim 3, I will conduct a study to test my ability to link the adapted measures results and the subject cardiologists' actual clinical decisions obtained from retrospective clinical data.    As a health services researcher, woman and practicing cardiologist, I am uniquely positioned to make important contributions to the field of gender disparities and CVD. I will bridge the fields of social psychology and health services research in order to gain a better understanding of potential contributors to gender disparities and plan for multimodal interventions aimed at reducing or eliminating disparities in CVD care. My extensive methodological training, research experience and proposed training activities make me ideally positioned to perform the proposed studies. Furthermore, the unique resources available at the University of Colorado Denver and its affiliated campuses will ensure my success towards these goals. Specifically, my mentorship team includes experts in health services and disparities research (Drs. Masoudi, Havranek, and Blair), measurement of explicit and implicit bias using social psychology experimental procedures (Dr. Blair), adaption of survey tools based on qualitative techniques (Dr. Main) and advanced hierarchical modeling (Dr. Dickinson). This qualified group of mentors and the training activities I propose will ensure my successful transition towards independence. Project Narrative  We know that women are less likely than men to get certain cardiology procedures. The purpose of this research project is to understand if health care providers' beliefs, or stereotypes, about the traits that women and men have potentially explain these differences.",Gender Disparities in Invasive CVD Procedure Use: the Role of Provider Bias,8714027,K08HL103776,"['angiographic imaging ', ' Angiogram ', ' Angiography ', ' Attitude ', ' Belief ', ' Cardiovascular Disease (Specialty) ', ' Cardiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Colorado ', ' Complication ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' health care service ', ' Health Services ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Literature ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Social Psychology ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sexual dimorphism (noncellular) ', ' gender difference ', ' Sex Differences ', ' Sex Characteristics ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stereotyping ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Training Activity ', ' consciousness loss ', ' Unconsciousness ', ' Unconscious ', ' Unconscious State ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Procedures ', ' Left ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Sexism ', ' Gender Bias ', ' Sex Bias ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Consciousness ', ' Conscious ', ' Measurement ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' tool ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Nuclear ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' Provider ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Research Training ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' willingness ', ' Outcome ', ' Stress Tests ', ' Implicit Association Test ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' multimodal intervention ', ' multifaceted intervention ', ' multicomponent intervention ', ' multi-modal intervention ', ' multi-faceted intervention ', ' multi-component intervention ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO DENVER,K08,2014,131490,0.11365928591743057
"Diet and metabolic risks: joint drivers of global epidemiologic transition and he     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background - Diet and its effects on metabolic risk factors are key drivers of the global epidemiologic transition. However, few studies have quantitatively assessed the complex interrelationships between dietary and metabolic risk factors, their combined effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes, their associations with macro-socioeconomic variables, and their influence on global health disparities in the context of the epidemiologic transition. Scientific Objectives- 1) To study the inter- relationship between individual dietary and metabolic risk factors in the context of overall diet, 2) To develop sophisticated and robust analytical methods for quantifying the combined effects of diet and metabolic risks on CVD and diabetes, 3) To examine how dietary and metabolic risk factors are influenced by macro- socioeconomic factors such as urbanization, income inequality, and education, and 4) to evaluate how diet, metabolic risk factors, and their relationship to macro-socioeconomic factors contribute to health disparities globally. Scientific and Public Health Impact - This work will provide key insights into the relationships between diet, metabolic risk, and macro-socioeconomic determinants of health and their combined impacts on CVD and diabetes within the context of the global epidemiologic transition. In addition, this research will provide essential new knowledge on how differences in risk factor levels affect global disparities in CVD/diabetes mortality by gender, ethnicity, and age. This research will directly inform data-driven, targeted health policies and interventions to stem the rising epidemic of CVD and diabetes, and will develop new interdisciplinary computational methodologies for assessing the health effects of multiple risk factors. Career Objectives - My primary career objective is to become an independent researcher in a tenure-track faculty position conducting rigorous empirical work focused on understanding the drivers of the global CVD epidemic and developing strategies to prevent CVD and diabetes worldwide. Career Impact - The K99 phase of this award will allow me to spend focused time on professional development activities in a mentored environment to learn particular skills, such as grant writing, public speaking, developing networks of collaborators, and managing a research group that are indispensible in becoming an independent investigator. In addition, it will allow me the opportunity to take advanced courses and learn high-level research methods and substantive knowledge in nutritional, cardiovascular, and social epidemiology and biostatistics from my mentor and senior colleagues. This training will allow me to broaden and deepen the scope of my research, especially since my doctoral degree was in a different field. The R00 phase of this award will launch my career as an independent scientist in a tenure-track position in a research-oriented university, allowing me to establish my research program with high-quality analyses and publications, while securing additional grant support.

"Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States and disables 10 million Americans each year. However, CVD risk in the US is higher for African Americans (AAs) relative to European Americans (EAs). In addition to R/E differences in CVD risk, there is extensive data demonstrating that, relative to EAs, AAs have higher rates of poverty and a corresponding increase in exposure to environmental toxicants, including lead (Pb), both in their blood and in their bones. Moreover, studies suggest a positive association between Pb and blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and CVD mortality. The current proposal addresses the question of whether R/E differences in CVD are partially a consequence of corresponding differences in exposure to Pb from the environment. Furthermore, this proposal considers whether these effects might be amplified by R/E differences in psychosocial background, including social control motives, background stress, and racial discrimination. Specifically, our proposal focuses on whether R/E differences in Pb exposure might produce differing rates of CVD risk through underlying alterations in cardiovascular responses to acute psychological stress, a mechanism whereby the psychosocial environment can affect CVD risk. In recent research (Gump, et al., 2011), increasing blood Pb was associated with alterations in cardiac autonomic regulation reflecting ""co-inhibition"" of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity that is typically associated with greater vascular resistance, a cardiovascular pattern we had already observed in children with heightened early childhood blood Pb (Gump, et al., 2005). This vascular response to stress has also been shown to be associated with greater left ventricular mass, a significant predictor of cardiovascular morbidity. Interestingly, a number of studies have noted that AAs respond to psychological stress with a vascular pattern relative to EAs typical cardiac response and are more likely than EAs to develop left ventricular hypertrophy at similar levels of blood pressure, and have greater arterial stiffness as reflected by faster pulse wave velocity. In sum, there is evidence that: 1) AAs (relative to EAs) have higher levels of blood Pb, 2) AAs (relative to EAs) typically respond to stress with a more vascular pattern, as well as greater arterial stiffness and left ventricular mass, and 3) increasing Pb is associated with a heightened vascular response to acute stress. This accumulated evidence provides strong support for testing the hypothesis that R/E differences in Pb exposure might account for R/E differences in cardiovascular patterns of response to acute stress and R/E differences in left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease relative to European Americans, although the reason for this racial health disparity is not understood. Taken together, the racial disparity in lead (Pb) exposure and additional evidence for effects of Pb on cardiovascular functioning suggest a possible mechanism for differences in disease prevalence. As a method to understand the early antecedents of these racial disparities, children represent an important population in which to consider effects of Pb exposure on subclinical CVD outcomes.","Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children",8928379,R01ES023252,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' bone ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' hemodynamics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' K element ', ' Potassium ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Controls ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' United States ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pattern ', ' LV Mass ', ' Left Ventricular Mass ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohesion ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' early childhood ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Trace metal ', ' social ', ' acute stress ', ' Regulation ', ' blood Pb ', ' blood lead ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Sum ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' diophantine approximation ', ' number theory ', ' ']",NIEHS,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,143920,0.10688881752909758
"Childhood Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: An Intergenerational Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for more than one-third of all U.S. deaths and a major source of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities. Rising child and adolescent obesity rates threaten to erase the prior success of CVD prevention efforts. Without significant improvements in prevention, CVD prevalence is likely to increase by 10%, and related healthcare costs are likely to triple by 2030. Obesity and hypertension are major contributors to CVD risk and major sources of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities over the life course. Low-income African Americans are particularly vulnerable. Despite the availability of: 1) behavioral interventions addressing diet and physical activity as mainstays of obesity and CVD risk reduction, and 2) research evidence suggesting that family-level interventions may be important for eliminating child and adolescent CVD and obesity disparities; most adult CVD risk reduction interventions do not consider family- level effects. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an innovative and effective family-level intervention targeting adolescent family members of African-American (AA) adults at high-risk for CVD. This research will: 1) identify mechanisms by which an individual-level CVD risk reduction intervention can produce family-level effects, 2) yield an innovative family-level intervention that is likely to reduce adolescent CVD and obesity risk among high-risk AA youth, and 3) generate valuable pilot data for a future R01 proposal to inform refinement and evaluation of the family-level intervention developed via this proposal. This research is a critica step in developing effective and innovative family-level interventions with significant positive impacts on CVD and obesity disparities among high-risk adolescents. It also represents a critical next step in the scholarly development of the candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23). The candidate for this K23, Dr. Rachel J. Thornton, is a general pediatrician and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded patient-oriented researcher studying development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of multilevel interventions to eliminate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in child and adolescent CVD and obesity risk. During the award, Dr. Thornton will complete a rigorous program of training, including advanced coursework and practical research. Her proposed activities will occur within the rich training environment of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Johns Hopkins University including the Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Disparities and the Johns Hopkins Global Center on Childhood Obesity. Dr. Thornton will be supported by an exceptional mentoring team, including national and international experts in intervention research, health disparities, CVD, and childhood obesity. Through the proposed K23, Dr. Thornton will develop a solid foundation in CVD epidemiology and intervention research and will be well-equipped to successfully transition into an independent, highly skilled patient-oriented researcher.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are significant racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in child and adolescent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and obesity risk. Rising rates of child and adolescent obesity threaten to reverse improvements in CVD prevention and contribute to persistent disparities in CVD.

"CVD in American Indians Biomarker lab and Arizona Field Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life.

"The Taxi Network     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are over 230,000 taxi drivers in the U.S. and 42,000 in New York City (NYC), where 84% are immigrant. Taxi drivers are at great risk for poor health, with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) and overlapping cancer risk, due to stress, diet, sedentary lifestyle, environmental exposures, and poor health care access. The taxi driver community, while facing tremendous health risk, also has notable assets to facilitate the health of its drivers. Community networks have the potential to disseminate health risk reduction information and strategies. The overall goal of this Taxi Network proposal is to create a robust community- based participatory research (CBPR) infrastructure that taps into the many assets of the taxi driver community, to work towards the elimination of health disparities in this large a-risk group. The specific aims include: 1. To develop a robust, enduring, fluid CBPR program with the large NYC taxi driver community, co- led by community and scientific research partners, with an active Taxi CAB (Community Advisory/Action Board), and Advisory and Steering Committees, to create a platform for co-learning, sharing resources and dissemination of outreach, education, service delivery, research, and policy action projects, to improve the cardiovascular health of this large at-risk community. 2. To work with the Taxi CAB to use a mixed methods approach of focus groups, key informant interviews, questionnaires, social network analysis, and resource mapping to conduct a detailed analysis of the health-related priorities, needs and assets of the taxi driver community, and the potential points and methods of intervention. 3.To design and pilot a CBPR CVD risk reduction pedometer exercise study, tailored to reflect the unique circumstances of the taxi driver community and capitalizing on assets such as their social networks and the window of opportunity of the airport holding lot. Taxi Network has been developed through an ongoing, iterative process with the community, and builds upon extensive preliminary work in this area.

"Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States and disables 10 million Americans each year. However, CVD risk in the US is higher for African Americans (AAs) relative to European Americans (EAs). In addition to R/E differences in CVD risk, there is extensive data demonstrating that, relative to EAs, AAs have higher rates of poverty and a corresponding increase in exposure to environmental toxicants, including lead (Pb), both in their blood and in their bones. Moreover, studies suggest a positive association between Pb and blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and CVD mortality. The current proposal addresses the question of whether R/E differences in CVD are partially a consequence of corresponding differences in exposure to Pb from the environment. Furthermore, this proposal considers whether these effects might be amplified by R/E differences in psychosocial background, including social control motives, background stress, and racial discrimination. Specifically, our proposal focuses on whether R/E differences in Pb exposure might produce differing rates of CVD risk through underlying alterations in cardiovascular responses to acute psychological stress, a mechanism whereby the psychosocial environment can affect CVD risk. In recent research (Gump, et al., 2011), increasing blood Pb was associated with alterations in cardiac autonomic regulation reflecting ""co-inhibition"" of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity that is typically associated with greater vascular resistance, a cardiovascular pattern we had already observed in children with heightened early childhood blood Pb (Gump, et al., 2005). This vascular response to stress has also been shown to be associated with greater left ventricular mass, a significant predictor of cardiovascular morbidity. Interestingly, a number of studies have noted that AAs respond to psychological stress with a vascular pattern relative to EAs typical cardiac response and are more likely than EAs to develop left ventricular hypertrophy at similar levels of blood pressure, and have greater arterial stiffness as reflected by faster pulse wave velocity. In sum, there is evidence that: 1) AAs (relative to EAs) have higher levels of blood Pb, 2) AAs (relative to EAs) typically respond to stress with a more vascular pattern, as well as greater arterial stiffness and left ventricular mass, and 3) increasing Pb is associated with a heightened vascular response to acute stress. This accumulated evidence provides strong support for testing the hypothesis that R/E differences in Pb exposure might account for R/E differences in cardiovascular patterns of response to acute stress and R/E differences in left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease relative to European Americans, although the reason for this racial health disparity is not understood. Taken together, the racial disparity in lead (Pb) exposure and additional evidence for effects of Pb on cardiovascular functioning suggest a possible mechanism for differences in disease prevalence. As a method to understand the early antecedents of these racial disparities, children represent an important population in which to consider effects of Pb exposure on subclinical CVD outcomes.            ","Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children",8616756,R01ES023252,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' bone ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' hemodynamics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' K element ', ' Potassium ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Controls ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' United States ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pattern ', ' LV Mass ', ' Left Ventricular Mass ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohesion ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' early childhood ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Trace metal ', ' social ', ' acute stress ', ' Regulation ', ' blood Pb ', ' blood lead ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Sum ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' public health relevance ', ' diophantine approximation ', ' number theory ', ' ']",NIEHS,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R01,2014,457163,0.10688881752909758
"Racial/Ethnic Differences in 25(OH)D and PTH Levels and CVD among Women     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent report on vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted the need for further research to clarify the optimal levels of vitamin D for nonskeletal outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to assess whether the relationships vary by race/ethnicity. Observational studies have suggested interrelationships between low 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH) D], high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and increased risk of CVD. Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), the major vitamin D carrier protein, plays a key role in regulating vitamin D bioavailability and could potentially be a predictor of CVD events or an effect modifier of the relation between 25(OH) D and/or PTH and CVD. Vitamin D metabolites are mostly bound to VDBP and albumin, and it is possible that the free, unbound portions of vitamin D metabolites are the most biologically active and therefore most relevant for CVD risk prediction. However, no studies have specifically assessed the association between free or bioavailable 25(OH) D levels and CVD. Available evidence on total 25(OH)D levels and cardiovascular health also remains inconsistent and inconclusive, and few studies have had sufficient size and racial/ethnic diversity to examine these relationships across a broad range of circulating 25(OH)D levels. Clearly, there is a clinical and public health need to determine whether the relationships between vitamin D biomarkers and CVD vary by race/ethnicity and whether such differences can help to explain racial/ethnic disparities in CVD risk. The Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS), one of the largest and most racially/ethnically diverse cohorts of postmenopausal women with comprehensive information on CVD risk factors, intermediate phenotypes, and outcomes, offers a unique and cost-effective opportunity to answer important and timely questions about racial/ethnic differences in vitamin D biomarkers with regard to CVD risk. We propose to conduct a prospective case-cohort study in the WHI-OS to assess racial/ethnic differences in the associations of total and free 25(OH)D, VDBP, and PTH levels with major cardiovascular events (a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], nonfatal stroke, and CVD mortality). We will include all incident CVD cases in African-American (black) women (N=650) and a random sample of incident CVD cases in white women (N=1,500). Noncases will be drawn from a random subcohort of black (N=1,300) and white women (N=1,500) in the WHI-OS. In addition, we will examine whether total and free 25(OH)D, VDBP, and PTH levels correlate with a variety of intermediate CVD phenotypes, including directly measured anthropometric indices, blood pressure, lipids, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, glycemic status, insulin resistance, insulin secretion, and renal function. In summary, the WHI-OS provides an exceptional opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the full spectrum of variation in levels of total and free 25(OH) D, VDBP, and PTH and to examine their potential independent and joint contributions to racial/ethnic disparities in CVD risk among postmenopausal women.

"Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease Risk: From Genes to Neighborhoods     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are a major public health concern as the leading cause of death and as a major source of racial/ethnic health disparities. Because CVD is a multi-factorial disease, a true understanding of its etiology requires investigations of interactions among many genetic and environmental factors. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to advance our understanding of how multi-level factors (from genes to neighborhoods) synergistically affect CVD. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop measures of neighborhood socioeconomic, built/physical, and social environments, 2) examine cross- sectional and longitudinal associations between genetic and neighborhood factors, and their interactions in relation to CVD risk factors, and 3) examine racial/ethnic differences in CVD risk factors and determine if these differences are explained by neighborhood-gene interactions. These aims will be achieved through the merging of data from the Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health (RPGEH), with data derived from available sources on neighborhoods and the built environment. The RPGEH is one of the largest research resources in the U.S. designed to examine genetic and environmental determinants of common diseases. The candidate, Mahasin Mujahid, is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. The proposed NHLBI Mentored Career Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Mujahid with the unique opportunity to augment her current expertise in general epidemiology, social epidemiology, and population health with new training in cardiovascular pathophysiology, genetic epidemiology, and statistical genetics. Moreover, Dr. Mujahid will receive the necessary support and training to work towards her long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program on the social epidemiology of cardiovascular disease with an emphasis on the underlying biological, genetic, and epigenetic pathways linking social factors to CVD.

"Social and Cultural Influences on Cardiovascular Risk in South Asians  Project Summary: Individual-level interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been met with limited success in many minority communities, partly because they do not address the sociocultural context in which individuals live and make food and physical activity choices. Widening our inquiry beyond the individual, to the larger social drivers can provide key insights into how social influences can be leveraged in interpersonal and community-level interventions to engage at-risk communities. Social networks influence health via many mechanisms: social influence and control; establishment of health beliefs and normative behaviors; feelings of shared identity and belonging; and provision of support. Social influences are key determinants of health; yet social network analysis has rarely been used to examine links between social networks and health in minorities.  The Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in American (MASALA) study is the first population-based cohort of South Asians (SAs) in the United States and is a substantial investment by the National Institutes of Health to understand the CVD disparities in the rapidly growing SA population. We propose to leverage that investment to investigate social network structures and sociocultural drivers of CVD risk factors in the MASALA cohort. Social relationships an especially important influence on SAs health behaviors because 90% are immigrants who believe kinship and family are paramount with emphasis on collectivism, social control, and maintenance of group identity. Our data from the MASALA study show that SAs have the highest prevalence of diabetes, an important CVD risk factor, and the lowest levels of physical activity compared to Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Chinese in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We also find that sociocultural influences may be partly driving these disparities and that individual-level prevention efforts may not be as effective in the tightly-knit, family-oriented SA community.  In the proposed ancillary project, the multidisciplinary research team will utilize quantitative social network methods to: 1) Uncover the unmeasured sociocultural drivers of variance in proximal CVD risk factors (body mass index, waist circumference, diet and physical activity behaviors); and qualitative methods to: 2) Investigate the meaning, significance, and function of SAs' social networks with respect to how they influence food and physical activity preferences and constraints. Qualitative interviews will provide greater context to the quantitative findings and elucidate mutable avenues for future intervention. Our team, with expertise in CVD prevention and nutritional epidemiology, sociocultural determinants of health, and social network analysis is well-poised to conduct this mixed methods research. The proposed research addresses critical gaps in CVD prevention research: understanding the influence of social networks on CVD risk and how these influences can be leveraged to improve the cardiovascular health of immigrant and minority communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been argued that social relationships are important to health and well-being. This study will investigate links between social networks and cardiovascular disease risk factors in South Asians, the second fastest growing ethnic group in the US and one with disparate rates of coronary heart disease. Identifying and understanding the links between social networks and cardiovascular disease is key to the development and testing of family- and community-level prevention interventions for minorities.            ",Social and Cultural Influences on Cardiovascular Risk in South Asians,8605408,R01HL120725,"['Americas ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' driving ', ' Automobile Driving ', ' Behavior ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Belief ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' India ', ' Interview ', ' Investments ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Pakistan ', ' well-being ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Controls ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' wt gain ', ' body weight increase ', ' body weight gain ', ' Weight Increase ', ' Weight Gain ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Generations ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Mediating ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Social Network ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Immigrant ', ' Life ', ' waist circumference ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' meetings ', ' preference ', ' American ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' success ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' social ', ' health-related belief ', ' health belief ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Provider ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' nutritional epidemiology ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' South Asian ', ' Characteristics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' network models ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2014,702023,0.1284149426182083
"CVD in American Indians  Study and Data Management Center and OK Field Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life.

"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR GENOMIC DISSECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical Methods for Genomic Dissection of Cardiovascular Diseases Abstract This mentored career development grant application proposes a training program to integrate Dr. Sung's previous research in statistical genetics into cardiovascular disease (CVD). Her long-term career goal is to establish herself as an independent statistician in CVD genetics research so that she can more effectively participate in multi-disciplinary research programs with clinical and translational CVD researchers and be better equipped to develop and apply statistical methods to contribute more meaningfully to the field of CVD genetics. This will be achieved through building a strong foundation in the clinical and research aspects of CVD and enhancing her understanding of genomics and whole-genome sequence data. Dr. Sung's mentoring team consists of multi-disciplinary researchers with a strong research track record. Complex cardiometabolic traits including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes contribute to CVD, the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the industrialized world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to many exciting discoveries. However, most GWAS discoveries have not been translated to clinical care because the functional mechanisms underlying the genetic associations remain elusive and the roles played by the environment in modulating these associations remain poorly defined. The research objective of this K25 application is to decipher the genetic and environmental architecture of cardiometabolic traits by incorporating GxE interactions and regulatory annotation information. We hypothesize that joint analysis of the environment, regulatory variants and coding variants will enhance the discovery of putative genetic variants and the functional mechanisms underlying cardiometabolic traits. To evaluate this hypothesis, we aim to identify genetic variants involving GxE interactions and identify putative functional variants by incorporating ENCODE regulation information.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the genetic and environmental architecture of cardiometabolic traits will contribute to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease which may have important implications for personalized medicine.                ",STATISTICAL METHODS FOR GENOMIC DISSECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,8767880,K25HL121091,"['abstracting ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' DNase ', ' DNA Nucleases ', ' Deoxyribonucleases ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Dissection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fasting ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Lipids ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Social protection, work and family strain: disadvantage effects in US and Europe    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is losing ground in health: our ranking in life expectancy is near the bottom of European countries and comparisons of major chronic conditions in the US and 13 European countries showed the US to have higher disease prevalence than any comparison country. The diverging life expectancy (LE) trends have been most distinct for American women, but the US also fares poorly with regard to male life expectancy and infant mortality. The health gap is largest among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, but even well- educated Americans have worse health than many of Europeans. We hypothesize that the explanations for the American health disadvantage have roots in the challenging social context faced by families, and in particular women, in post-WWII America. Since WWII, American society has been marked by: high fertility; high female labor market participation; weak labor laws and family protection policies; and family instability, and increased single parenthood. The combination or convergence of these factors created a ""perfect storm"" that threatened vulnerable families and imposed extreme stresses even on the relatively advantaged. Such social conditions might work via influencing health behaviors or through more direct physiological mechanisms. We have developed a theoretical framework for this confluence of conditions that builds on the job strain models incorporating dimensions of demand, control and support but adds an important dimension related to family that extends the strain model beyond work to family life. Over time Americans, especially women, have experienced high demands in terms of full time work often with high family demands, coupled with low formal support ( social protection policies) or informal support from other family members. This combination especially among workers with low job control leads to a cumulative disadvantage taking its toll in health over time. In order to understand whether these social conditions account for cross area variations in risk we must understand whether either the distribution and/or the toxicity of the ""risk"" vary across areas. We draw from ongoing studies including HRS, SHARE and ELSA, mortality data at a country level (using the human mortality files) and data on public policies, collected from the CPS,SIPP and SHARELIFE and OECD. We propose 4 specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the distribution of work-family strain for females born 1920-1960, across the US and EU. Aim 2: Assess the differential toxicity of work-family strain on CVD risk behaviors and biomarkers, incidence of stroke and heart disease, CVD mortality, and life expectancy in the US and Europe. Aim 3: Assess whether distributions or the toxicity of work-family strain explain geographic and temporal variations in CVD and life expectancy. Aim 4: Assess impacts of trends in work-family strain on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in the US and Europe.        With the vast majority of women in the labor force who also have young children and with the aging of societies virtually across the globe, there is an urgent public health need to provide both formal (policy) and informal (family) support to women and their families. Evidence suggests that work family strain has an adverse impact on health outcomes for low wage employees and young children and perhaps other groups. Countries in which a number of work family policies have been implemented seem to fewer adverse population health outcomes. This situation is particularly severe in the US where fertility and labor force participation among women is high and where state and federal policies promoting the health of families is very limited.

"Mentoring in community influences on CVD risk    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This is a proposal for a midcareer investigator award in patient-oriented research. This career development award will give Dr. Corbie-Smith the dedicated time to focus on patient-oriented research in cardiovascular disease prevention, and recruit and mentor some of the brightest young scientists at UNC into healthcare disparities research. Her immediate career objectives are: 1) To extend her work in engaging communities of color in research by developing interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease that address patients in the context of their communities; 2) To understand the influence of community factors in underserved communities and their impact on healthcare utilization and health outcomes in cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular risk factors; and 3) To provide outstanding mentorship by creating a training environment that supports the conduct of high impact research in cardiovascular prevention and outcomes. The specific aims for the new research to be supported through this K24 Midcareer Investigator award include 1) Determine the feasibility of training a current cohort of community health advisors as navigators to link residents with multiple cardiovascular risk factors to local healthcare systems; 2) Determine the impact of navigators on cardiovascular risk factor control (HgbA1C, physical activity, BP control, smoking) and access to care for community members at increased risk for cardiovascular disease; 3) Identify community and social factors that influence cardiovascular risk factor control and outcomes. This two-arm trial will investigate the role of navigators on cardiovascular outcomes in community based outreach programs to improve access and utilization of medical services. Two to three navigators at each of the four sites will be utilized. Patients will be randomized to either a navigator intervention or to usual patient management practices, with measurement at baseline and six months. This study targets a disease condition and population of significant importance - CVD risk factor prevention in rural African Americans - and extends an existing effective model in several important ways. This study situates the navigator and patient within the community (rather than the healthcare system) thus increasing the cultural relevance of the intervention. Rather than a focus on one condition, navigators will support access and management of several chronic conditions, thus addressing the reality of multiple co-morbidities in underserved patients. Lastly, augmenting patient data with community variables allows a comprehensive analysis of external influence on cardiovascular disease prevention and healthcare utilization.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:  The proposed research will advance public health by testing a patient navigator program to improve access to and quality of care for those with heart disease risk factors. The mentoring component will train new researchers to conduct high impact heart disease prevention research.

"CVD in American Indians:  Imaging and Cardiovascular Center     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes.

For example, African Americans have a considerably higher prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure than Caucasians despite lipid patterns and coronary artery calcium levels that generally show relatively favorable distributions. However, only limited research has addressed the role of sleep disorders in influencing CVD in ethnic minorities despite evidence that sleep disorders disproportionately affect minority populations and, through pro-inflammatory or autonomic nervous system dysregulation, operate as risk factors for hypertension and CVD. In this proposed ancillary study to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we aim to perform standardized in-home polysomnography and 7-day wrist actigraphy in 2500 African American, Hispanic, Asian American and Caucasian individuals participating in MESA Exam 5 to derive indices of sleep apnea, quality, duration and timing. Newly collected sleep data will be rigorously standardized and comprehensively analyzed by a central Reading Center. By capitalizing on the rich clinical, physiological, anthropomorphic, and biochemical data collected longitudinally by MESA over 10 years, we will test the associations between indices of sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index, nocturnal hypoxemia), sleep duration and quality, slow wave activity, and circadian placement with the indices of CVD risk, subclinical CVD and clinical CVD as outcomes. Finally, we will quantify the extent to which sleep disorders and patterns account for previously observed variations in CVD among ethnic and sex groups. By defining the role of sleep disorders in CVD in ethnic minorities, these activities may direct future interventions directed at reducing ethnic disparities in chronic health conditions. Project Narrative  The proposed addition of objective measurements of sleep to MESA will fill an important gap in risk factor data in this unique cohort and allow the role of sleep disorders in atherosclerosis and CVD pathogenesis to be better defined, thus paving the way for important intervention studies that may improve health disparities in CVD.",ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH

"Reducing Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Rural Communities in NC     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, however African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group. African Americans carry a significant burden of CVD risk factors that often co-occur; this burden is amplified in rural communities. CVD disparities at the intersection of race and geography are driven by individual risk behaviors and complicated by factors such as limited access to quality healthcare, socio-economic inequities, limited healthcare infrastructure and environmental barriers to behavior change. Interventions to ameliorate CVD burden in rural African American communities will require placing the individual in the context of the larger community and taking advantage of new technologies to support behavior change. However, how best to integrate mobile technology into existing evidenced based interventions (EBIs) is still an emerging field and social and physical environmental factors important in rural communities are rarely considered in existing EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by determining the feasibility and efficacy of adapting EBIs to consider the social and physical environment in important in rural African American communities and determining the acceptability of mobile technology in these communities to support behavior change. The proposed study is built on the strong foundation of Project GRACE's 8-year history of designing and testing interventions using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and individual and collaborative expertise in community-based CVD outreach, service and research. We have developed a phased CBPR study with a long-term goal to reduce rates of CVD in Eastern NC. The overall objective of this proposal is to assess feasibility of implementing an EBI, adapted to the needs and interests of a rural community in order to plan a large scale study. To that end our specific aims are to 1) expand and sustain a Project GRACE CVD coalition of community and academic stakeholders to develop successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities; 2) conduct a mixed-method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble, review and assess existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths and resources using a web-based survey of community, faith based, social service and healthcare organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk reduction EBIs and community members' perceptions of possible targets for intervention using focus group interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and facilitators) on acceptability of EBI acceptability; 3) adapt PREMIER, a multi-component EBI using intervention mapping; and 4) conduct a small-scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b) feasibility and adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings.                  Project Narrative Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US; however, African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group.

"Strong Hearts_Healthy Communities_A Rural Community CVD Prevention Program     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY There are notable cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities among people living in rural settings, particularly medically underserved rural areas. Complex factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage, social and cultural dynamics, geographic distances/barriers, and limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities contribute to the issue. Montana is one of the most rural states, with 76% of its 998,199 people living in rural or frontier (<6 people/square mile) areas. Montana's CVD rates have declined similarly to U.S. rates, but it remains the leading cause of death, and CVD risk factors such as obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes are increasing. The objective of Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities (SHHC) is to reduce rural CVD disparities through civic engagement and implementation of a community-based intervention in 10 underserved Montana towns. SHHC builds upon a long-standing collaboration with National Institute of Food and Agriculture cooperative extension educators, who will implement the project. For Specific Aim 1, we will inform intervention development through community audits, qualitative research, and forming Community Advisory Boards (CABs) with residents, health educators, local leadership, and other stakeholders in the 10 towns. We will gather knowledge about economic, social/cultural, built environment, food access, healthcare, and related topics. For Aim 1.1, we will incorporate audit, focus group, and key informant findings as well as input from CABs to inform the SHHC curriculum, facilitate community engagement, and build capacity. For Aim 2, overweight and obese midlife and older women will participate in a 24-week community-randomized study. Subjects will attend twice weekly classes focused on exercise, nutrition, and CVD prevention education and skills. Each group will also choose a CVD-related community health issue of relevance to their town and help facilitate community events and activities, e.g. healthy foods, physical activity opportunitie, wellness services. We will evaluate anthropometric (e.g. BMI), physiologic (e.g. lipids, blood pressure), behavioral (e.g. 7-day accelerometry), and psychosocial (e.g. quality of life) outcomes. For Aim 2.1, we will evaluate attitudinal and behavioral changes among members of the SHHC participants' ""social network"". Aim 2 intervention subjects will be asked to identify 1-5 of their closest friends and/or family members, who will be invited to complete baseline and follow-up questionnaires. The novel integration of community programming and civic engagement has the potential to effect clinically meaningful improvements in participants, families, and communities; this approach will help sustain reduced CVD rates by linking behavior change and community factors. Further, SHHC will provide a feasible model for other underserved rural communities to improve health and quality of life and reduce CVD risk among residents. In addition, we will convene a SHHC National Advisory Board, to provide expert guidance throughout the project, and to collaborate on a future large-scale effectiveness trial.                  PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals living in rural settings, particularly medically underserved areas, are at increased risk for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and other disparities affected by socioeconomic disadvantage, topographic and geographical distances/barriers, social and cultural issues, and limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities. The proposed community-based randomized controlled trial will utilize a participatory approach to engage local residents, health educators, and community leaders to inform the development of an evidence-based CVD-prevention program that will be implemented by NIFA extension educators in 10 medically underserved rural communities. The integration of community-informed program development as well as civic engagement and capacity building activities focused on local resources (e.g. healthy foods, physical activity opportunities, preventive healthcare services) will provide an innovative model for improved rural community health promotion, health behavior maintenance, and community environment factors as well as the potential for broad public health impact in other underserved rural areas through national dissemination.",Strong Hearts_Healthy Communities_A Rural Community CVD Prevention

"New York University, City University of New York Health Promotion & Prevention Re     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes burden and disparities require the adoption, dissemination and implementation of evidence-based strategies involving both clinical and community partners in alignment with a consistent set of goals that are advanced by multi-sector stakeholders, including front-line public health agencies, federal agencies, health providers and payors. The proposed application seeks to establish an innovative public-private partnership between the currently funded New York University (NYU) Prevention Research Center (PRC) and the City University of New York School of Public Health (CUNY SPH) that leverages existing collaborations in public health practice and research collaborations between partner institutions and their local, state, and federal public health agencies. The proposed NYU- CUNY PRC focuses on improving the health of communities at risk for CVD disparities through the adoption, dissemination and implementation of integrated, evidence-based community and clinical strategies to advance goals of the Million Hearts Initiative. Our focus will be on Asian and Hispanic American communities, which share commonalities related to immigration, migration, acculturation, language access, and cultural diversity. For the Core Research Project, the NYU-CUNY PRC is partnering with a large health plan to test integrated combinations of community health worker (CHW) models and electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical interventions for CVD prevention in South Asian communities, with an aim.to advance implementation of the Million Hearts Initiative. PRC research activities align with CDC strategic priorities of disseminating health systems interventions to improve the effective delivery and use of clinical and preventive services and improve community-clinical linkages. In addition, the PRC efforts will support efforts to improve physical activity and nutrition, a core component of the Million Hearts Initiatie and a CDC-defined winnable battle. The PRC also aligns with EHR intervention efforts by local and state public health agencies and incorporates a population health surveillance perspective. PRC activities will contribute to understanding of how best to reduce CVD health disparities in Asian and Latino American communities through research, community engagement and training involving the full range of public health practitioners, community partners, academic researchers, and students of public health and medicine. The NYU-CUNY PRC application harnesses the vast breadth of population health resources and expertise across NYC and builds upon the partner institutions' rich foundation of community engagement and strong governmental linkages to address cardiovascular prevention among diverse Asian and Hispanic communities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed NYU-CUNY PRC focuses on improving the health of communities at risk for cardiovascular (CVD) disparities through the adoption, dissemination and implementation of evidence-based community and clinical strategies to advance goals of the U.S. Millions Hearts Initiative.

"ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH CARDIOVASCULAR HEALTH ACROSS ETHNIC GROUPS DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Large differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes have been observed across ethnic and gender groups which are not fully explained by consideration of traditional and novel CVD risk factors. For example, African Americans have a considerably higher prevalence of hypertension, left ventricular dysfunction, and heart failure than Caucasians despite lipid patterns and coronary artery calcium levels that generally show relatively favorable distributions. However, only limited research has addressed the role of sleep disorders in influencing CVD in ethnic minorities despite evidence that sleep disorders disproportionately affect minority populations and, through pro-inflammatory or autonomic nervous system dysregulation, operate as risk factors for hypertension and CVD. In this proposed ancillary study to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we aim to perform standardized in-home polysomnography and 7-day wrist actigraphy in 2500 African American, Hispanic, Asian American and Caucasian individuals participating in MESA Exam 5 to derive indices of sleep apnea, quality, duration and timing. Newly collected sleep data will be rigorously standardized and comprehensively analyzed by a central Reading Center. By capitalizing on the rich clinical, physiological, anthropomorphic, and biochemical data collected longitudinally by MESA over 10 years, we will test the associations between indices of sleep apnea (apnea hypopnea index, nocturnal hypoxemia), sleep duration and quality, slow wave activity, and circadian placement with the indices of CVD risk, subclinical CVD and clinical CVD as outcomes. Finally, we will quantify the extent to which sleep disorders and patterns account for previously observed variations in CVD among ethnic and sex groups. By defining the role of sleep disorders in CVD in ethnic minorities, these activities may direct future interventions directed at reducing ethnic disparities in chronic health conditions. Project Narrative  The proposed addition of objective measurements of sleep to MESA will fill an important gap in risk factor data in this unique cohort and allow the role of sleep disorders in atherosclerosis and CVD pathogenesis to be better defined, thus paving the way for important intervention studies that may improve health disparities in CVD.",ASSOCIATION OF SLEEP DISORDERS WITH

"Encouraging Mail Order Pharmacy Use to Improve Outcomes and Reduce Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adherence to effective cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor medications is associated with improved CVD risk factor control, fewer hospitalizations, and lower mortality in patients with diabetes. However, many patients are poorly adherent to medications, and there are persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in medication adherence. Traditional clinical trials of interventions to improve medication adherence are often resource-intensive, and focus exclusively on patient-level barriers to behavior change. Unsurprisingly, these trials have not led to sustainable, cost-effective approaches to improve adherence. Health system-level medication adherence interventions that can be implemented, ""scaled up,"" and sustained across a wide range of health care delivery settings are urgently needed. Delivering efficacious prescription drugs through existing mail order pharmacies can be considered a system-level approach to enhancing access to medications. Previous research using observational data has shown that mail order pharmacy use is associated with improved adherence to CVD risk factor medications, and with improved CVD risk factor control. Despite this evidence, and although mail order pharmacy use is potentially cost-saving to both patients and health plans, fewer than 25% of patients with diabetes use the mail order pharmacy to obtain their diabetes medications. Mail order pharmacy use is even lower among non- whites and patients with lower socioeconomic status. We propose a randomized encouragement trial to encourage use of existing mail order pharmacy services among diabetes patients with poor adherence to CVD risk factor medications and who only use retail pharmacies in 3 health care systems: Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Harvard Pilgrim, and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii. These combined systems include approximately 300,000 patients with diabetes with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Patients with no history of mail order pharmacy use will be randomized into 3 arms: 1) a standardized intervention to encourage mail order use and provide easily accessible information on how to access the service; 2) a personalized intervention that includes components of the standardized intervention as well as additional information tailored to patient-specific characteristics such as prescription regimens and individualized potential savings by switching to the mail order pharmacy; and 3) usual care. In addition to examining the impact of the intervention on medication adherence and CVD risk factor control, we will examine factors affecting the sustainability and dissemination of the intervention, assess the intervention's impact on utilization and health care costs, and determine whether the intervention's impact differs across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups. This research will provide a foundation for developing sustainable, system-level approaches to addressing medication adherence in diabetes patients that can be widely disseminated and implemented across a diverse array of health care systems.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this application is to test whether standardized and personalized outreach strategies to encourage mail order pharmacy use in diabetes patients at high risk for poor cardiovascular disease outcomes will result in greater medication adherence and improved cardiovascular disease risk factor control. We will assess differences in the impact of the intervention across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups, and evaluate the barriers and facilitators to sustaining and disseminating the intervention. This research will provide a foundation for implementing cost-effective, health system-level interventions to improve medication adherence in diabetes patients.            ",Encouraging Mail Order Pharmacy Use to Improve Outcomes and Reduce Disparities,8960561,R18DK104249,"['Affect ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' Health Sciences, Allied and Health Services Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Planning ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Mail Order ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy Services ', ' Pharmaceutic Services ', ' Pharmaceutical Services ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Drug Prescribing ', ' Drug Prescriptions ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Savings ', ' Testing ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Individual ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' behavior change ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' outreach ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Adherence ', ' Adherence (attribute) ', ' Data ', ' Qualifying ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Subgroup ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' medication adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' Diabetes prevention ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' scale up ', ' cost-effective ', ' cost effective ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical care ', ' usual care ', ' treatment as usual ', ' Regimen ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIDDK,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R18,2015,698403,0.09929649134464187
"Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K24 renewal is for Dr. Corbie-Smith to establish a premier research infrastructure to provide exceptional training for the next generation of CVD researchers who address the health and healthcare of patients who bear a disproportionate burden of CVD morbidity and mortality. Dr. Corbie-Smith has made excellent use of the support provided in the first cycle of her K24. She has been highly productive, with an impressive trajectory of peer-reviewed publications in the emerging field of community engaged research. She has been successful in funding her work, obtaining a new R01 grant focused on dissemination of an evidence based intervention to reduce CVD risk in rural African American populations. She has mentored her first trainees to independence, and new trainees she has mentored with her K24 support have been successful in terms of publications and funding. She has successfully mentored trainees in diverse fields such as nursing, medicine, health behavior, and epidemiology and the vast majority of trainees are scholars of color. This renewal will make it possible for the candidate to further develop her research program, and use her research program as a platform for her mentoring. She will leverage her ongoing R01, the Center for Health Equity Research, the Sheps Center for Health Services Research and NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, as a resource for her mentees. Bringing together the extensive career development resources of the Center for Health Equity Research, Sheps and NC Translational and Clinical Science Institute with the mentoring resources of the K24 gives the candidate a unique opportunity to develop exceptional mentoring to improve CVD outcomes. The proposed aims are to: (1) engage community members to define, map and programs. Finally, she will use the K24 to develop an innovative new research direction, examining the association between organizational networks in rural AA communities and sustainability of CVD interventions assess CVD risk reduction assets available in rural settings; (2) use mixed methods to understand the factors (communication, cooperation, and competition) that influence collaboration among organizations with CVD risk reduction programming; (3) conduct network analysis to understand how organizational networks change over time in rural communities among organizations conducting CVD risk reduction programming; and (4) examine the association between organizational networks and a) sustainability of CVD risk reduction interventions and b) CVD outcomes among participants in those interventions. The candidate will also continue a formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become successful leaders in CVD disparities research. Each mentee will have a focused career development plan that includes directed didactic and developmental activities and a mentored research project that will lead to first author publications.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors are dramatic in rural and minority communities with limited access to quality healthcare. In this proposal, we will define assets that already exist in communities to reduce CVD risk and examine how organizational assets and networks evolve and are associated with sustainability of interventions to reduce population CVD risk. Combined with the mentoring component, to train new and early stage researchers to conduct high impact CVD prevention research, the proposed research is highly relevant to NHLBI's mission to enhance the health of patients so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.                ",Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities,8968107,K24HL105493,"['Accounting ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Contraceptive Barrier Methods ', ' Barrier Methods ', ' Barrier Contraception ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Dairy Products ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Healthcare Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Care Research ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Rural Community ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' salt intake ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated fat ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' health equity ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K24,2015,117235,0.2611619605479507
"Strong Hearts_Healthy Communities_A Rural Community CVD Prevention Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY There are notable cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities among people living in rural settings, particularly medically underserved rural areas. Complex factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage, social and cultural dynamics, geographic distances/barriers, and limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities contribute to the issue. Montana is one of the most rural states, with 76% of its 998,199 people living in rural or frontier (<6 people/square mile) areas. Montana's CVD rates have declined similarly to U.S. rates, but it remains the leading cause of death, and CVD risk factors such as obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes are increasing. The objective of Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities (SHHC) is to reduce rural CVD disparities through civic engagement and implementation of a community-based intervention in 10 underserved Montana towns. SHHC builds upon a long-standing collaboration with National Institute of Food and Agriculture cooperative extension educators, who will implement the project. For Specific Aim 1, we will inform intervention development through community audits, qualitative research, and forming Community Advisory Boards (CABs) with residents, health educators, local leadership, and other stakeholders in the 10 towns. We will gather knowledge about economic, social/cultural, built environment, food access, healthcare, and related topics. For Aim 1.1, we will incorporate audit, focus group, and key informant findings as well as input from CABs to inform the SHHC curriculum, facilitate community engagement, and build capacity. For Aim 2, overweight and obese midlife and older women will participate in a 24-week community-randomized study. Subjects will attend twice weekly classes focused on exercise, nutrition, and CVD prevention education and skills. Each group will also choose a CVD-related community health issue of relevance to their town and help facilitate community events and activities, e.g. healthy foods, physical activity opportunitie, wellness services. We will evaluate anthropometric (e.g. BMI), physiologic (e.g. lipids, blood pressure), behavioral (e.g. 7-day accelerometry), and psychosocial (e.g. quality of life) outcomes. For Aim 2.1, we will evaluate attitudinal and behavioral changes among members of the SHHC participants' ""social network"". Aim 2 intervention subjects will be asked to identify 1-5 of their closest friends and/or family members, who will be invited to complete baseline and follow-up questionnaires. The novel integration of community programming and civic engagement has the potential to effect clinically meaningful improvements in participants, families, and communities; this approach will help sustain reduced CVD rates by linking behavior change and community factors. Further, SHHC will provide a feasible model for other underserved rural communities to improve health and quality of life and reduce CVD risk among residents. In addition, we will convene a SHHC National Advisory Board, to provide expert guidance throughout the project, and to collaborate on a future large-scale effectiveness trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals living in rural settings, particularly medically underserved areas, are at increased risk for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and other disparities affected by socioeconomic disadvantage, topographic and geographical distances/barriers, social and cultural issues, and limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities. The proposed community-based randomized controlled trial will utilize a participatory approach to engage local residents, health educators, and community leaders to inform the development of an evidence-based CVD-prevention program that will be implemented by NIFA extension educators in 10 medically underserved rural communities. The integration of community-informed program development as well as civic engagement and capacity building activities focused on local resources (e.g. healthy foods, physical activity opportunities, preventive healthcare services) will provide an innovative model for improved rural community health promotion, health behavior maintenance, and community environment factors as well as the potential for broad public health impact in other underserved rural areas through national dissemination.",Strong Hearts_Healthy Communities_A Rural Community CVD Prevention Program,8825531,R01HL120702,"['Affect ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Physical Exercise ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Leadership ', ' Lipids ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Montana ', ' Nutritional Science ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' Uninsured ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' Prevention education ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' underserved rural area ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' Community Integration ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' older women ', ' obesity risk ', ' medically underserved ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' therapy development ', ' evidence base ', ' ']",NHLBI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,588041,0.07322498492984861
"Reducing Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Rural Communities in NC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, however African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group. African Americans carry a significant burden of CVD risk factors that often co-occur; this burden is amplified in rural communities. CVD disparities at the intersection of race and geography are driven by individual risk behaviors and complicated by factors such as limited access to quality healthcare, socio-economic inequities, limited healthcare infrastructure and environmental barriers to behavior change. Interventions to ameliorate CVD burden in rural African American communities will require placing the individual in the context of the larger community and taking advantage of new technologies to support behavior change. However, how best to integrate mobile technology into existing evidenced based interventions (EBIs) is still an emerging field and social and physical environmental factors important in rural communities are rarely considered in existing EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by determining the feasibility and efficacy of adapting EBIs to consider the social and physical environment in important in rural African American communities and determining the acceptability of mobile technology in these communities to support behavior change. The proposed study is built on the strong foundation of Project GRACE's 8-year history of designing and testing interventions using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and individual and collaborative expertise in community-based CVD outreach, service and research. We have developed a phased CBPR study with a long-term goal to reduce rates of CVD in Eastern NC. The overall objective of this proposal is to assess feasibility of implementing an EBI, adapted to the needs and interests of a rural community in order to plan a large scale study. To that end our specific aims are to 1) expand and sustain a Project GRACE CVD coalition of community and academic stakeholders to develop successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities; 2) conduct a mixed-method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble, review and assess existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths and resources using a web-based survey of community, faith based, social service and healthcare organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk reduction EBIs and community members' perceptions of possible targets for intervention using focus group interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and facilitators) on acceptability of EBI acceptability; 3) adapt PREMIER, a multi-component EBI using intervention mapping; and 4) conduct a small-scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b) feasibility and adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings.

"Racial/Ethnic Differences in 25(OH)D and PTH Levels and CVD among Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent report on vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted the need for further research to clarify the optimal levels of vitamin D for nonskeletal outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to assess whether the relationships vary by race/ethnicity. Observational studies have suggested interrelationships between low 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH) D], high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and increased risk of CVD. Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), the major vitamin D carrier protein, plays a key role in regulating vitamin D bioavailability and could potentially be a predictor of CVD events or an effect modifier of the relation between 25(OH) D and/or PTH and CVD. Vitamin D metabolites are mostly bound to VDBP and albumin, and it is possible that the free, unbound portions of vitamin D metabolites are the most biologically active and therefore most relevant for CVD risk prediction. However, no studies have specifically assessed the association between free or bioavailable 25(OH) D levels and CVD. Available evidence on total 25(OH)D levels and cardiovascular health also remains inconsistent and inconclusive, and few studies have had sufficient size and racial/ethnic diversity to examine these relationships across a broad range of circulating 25(OH)D levels. Clearly, there is a clinical and public health need to determine whether the relationships between vitamin D biomarkers and CVD vary by race/ethnicity and whether such differences can help to explain racial/ethnic disparities in CVD risk. The Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS), one of the largest and most racially/ethnically diverse cohorts of postmenopausal women with comprehensive information on CVD risk factors, intermediate phenotypes, and outcomes, offers a unique and cost-effective opportunity to answer important and timely questions about racial/ethnic differences in vitamin D biomarkers with regard to CVD risk. We propose to conduct a prospective case-cohort study in the WHI-OS to assess racial/ethnic differences in the associations of total and free 25(OH)D, VDBP, and PTH levels with major cardiovascular events (a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], nonfatal stroke, and CVD mortality). We will include all incident CVD cases in African-American (black) women (N=650) and a random sample of incident CVD cases in white women (N=1,500). Noncases will be drawn from a random subcohort of black (N=1,300) and white women (N=1,500) in the WHI-OS. In addition, we will examine whether total and free 25(OH)D, VDBP, and PTH levels correlate with a variety of intermediate CVD phenotypes, including directly measured anthropometric indices, blood pressure, lipids, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, glycemic status, insulin resistance, insulin secretion, and renal function. In summary, the WHI-OS provides an exceptional opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the full spectrum of variation in levels of total and free 25(OH) D, VDBP, and PTH and to examine their potential independent and joint contributions to racial/ethnic disparities in CVD risk among postmenopausal women.

"Using practice facilitation in primary care settings to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inadequate implementation of guidelines for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in primary care settings, particularly those serving low-income and minority populations, has contributed to persistent disparities in CVD-related morbidity and mortality. The objective of this proposal is to fill this current research-to-practic gap by testing the effectiveness of practice facilitation as a quality improvement strategy for implementing evidence-based guidelines for reducing CVD-related risk factors in primary care practices in New York City. The specific focus, of this proposal is to improve adherence to the ABCS - Aspirin (A) in high-risk individuals, Blood pressure control (B), Cholesterol management (C), and Smoking cessation (S). The long-term goal is to create a robust infrastructure to disseminate and implement Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) findings in primary care practices and improve practices' capacity to implement other PCOR findings in the future. Recent systematic reviews demonstrate that interventions with proven effectiveness in promoting the implementation of evidence-based research are tailored to the practice context and involve a multicomponent approach based on the Chronic Care Model (CCM). Most practices, however, lack the resources and expertise to coordinate a complex set of multilevel system changes without assistance. One implementation strategy that may effectively overcome these barriers is practice facilitation (PF). PF provides external expertise on practice redesign i accord with the CCM, and promotes a tailored approach to implementing guideline-concordant care to improve patient outcomes. We therefore propose to study the impact of PF on CVD-related outcomes by employing a stepped-wedge design in which 250 EHR-enabled small to medium primary care sites are enrolled into the control at the same time and then randomly assigned to cross over into the intervention condition at three month intervals with all sites eventually receiving the intervention. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients that have reached clinical goals for the ABCSs. The significance of this proposal and potential for large-scale dissemination of findings is enhanced by the unique partnership between NYUSOM, and the NYC Department of Health (NYCDOH) Primary Care Improvement Program (PCIP), with over 3000 small to medium sized primary care practices in their regional extension center and the Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS), one of the premiere not-for-profit primary care associations in the country. The proposal leverages PCIP and CHCANY's robust information technology infrastructure and efficiencies offered by their centralized data warehouses with capacity for data collection across diverse settings with different EHRs. The project is expected to provide critical new knowledge to facilitate the widespread implementation, dissemination and sustained utilization of evidence- based guidelines for prevention of CVD across the U.S.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of preventable death in the U.S. Guidelines for reducing risk factors for CVD, like hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking exist, but they are not well integrated into primary care practice. We will study strategies that promise to increase implementation and dissemination of guidelines for reducing the risk of CVD in primary care settings serving those populations most at risk for CVD-related mortality. The potential population health impact of fully implementing CVD- related practice guidelines, particularly in health centers serving disparate populations, is substantial.           ",Using practice facilitation in primary care settings to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease,8885422,R18HS023922,[''],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R18,2015,4988456,0.07138264603880551
"New York University, City University of New York Health Promotion & Prevention Re     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Strategies to reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes burden and disparities require the adoption, dissemination and implementation of evidence-based strategies involving both clinical and community partners in alignment with a consistent set of goals that are advanced by multi-sector stakeholders, including front-line public health agencies, federal agencies, health providers and payors. The proposed application seeks to establish an innovative public-private partnership between the currently funded New York University (NYU) Prevention Research Center (PRC) and the City University of New York School of Public Health (CUNY SPH) that leverages existing collaborations in public health practice and research collaborations between partner institutions and their local, state, and federal public health agencies. The proposed NYU- CUNY PRC focuses on improving the health of communities at risk for CVD disparities through the adoption, dissemination and implementation of integrated, evidence-based community and clinical strategies to advance goals of the Million Hearts Initiative. Our focus will be on Asian and Hispanic American communities, which share commonalities related to immigration, migration, acculturation, language access, and cultural diversity. For the Core Research Project, the NYU-CUNY PRC is partnering with a large health plan to test integrated combinations of community health worker (CHW) models and electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical interventions for CVD prevention in South Asian communities, with an aim.to advance implementation of the Million Hearts Initiative. PRC research activities align with CDC strategic priorities of disseminating health systems interventions to improve the effective delivery and use of clinical and preventive services and improve community-clinical linkages. In addition, the PRC efforts will support efforts to improve physical activity and nutrition, a core component of the Million Hearts Initiatie and a CDC-defined winnable battle. The PRC also aligns with EHR intervention efforts by local and state public health agencies and incorporates a population health surveillance perspective. PRC activities will contribute to understanding of how best to reduce CVD health disparities in Asian and Latino American communities through research, community engagement and training involving the full range of public health practitioners, community partners, academic researchers, and students of public health and medicine.

"Parents' Dense and Supportive Social Networks Facilitate Children's Health     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic status (SES) powerfully influences one's health.1 Considerable gaps exist, with childhood SES serving as an especially important factor in determining health throughout the lifespan.2, 3 The proposed research's broad objective is to understand how a family's social context-namely, the nature of the social network in which parents are embedded-relates to children's cardiovascular health. This question will be explored with a particular focus on lower SES families, whose children are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).4, 5 Past research has found that strong social support is associated with lower CVD risk (and other positive health outcomes).6 Here we suggest that when parents have effective social networks, children will be able to develop effective skills for coping with adversity, which will in turn, reduce their CVD risk. Specifically, the research tests the novel hypotheses that social networks that are (1) dense (i.e., a community where many people know each other and have a strong sense of obligation to assist others) and (2) provide more assistance than they require in return (i.e., so that they provide support, on balance, rather than draining already scarce resources) will be most effective at helping children develop effective coping skills and reduce children's CVD risk. Such networks' capacity to provide additional resources will be especially important in lower SES families, where resources are often lacking. If a child's parents have more social, emotional, and material resources from their networks, the child will be more likely to develop beliefs that, as previous research suggests, wil help to reduce their CVD risk. Such beliefs will be especially valuable for lower SES children, who are especially likely to encounter adversity. Since the proposed project aims to reduce CVD risk, particularly among those at the greatest risk (i.e., lower SES children), it pertains directl to NHLBI's mission of preventing heart disease.  The proposed research will be part of a larger research project in which 250 families (parents and children) of a range of SES backgrounds will participate. In surveys administered at the beginning of the study and then each day over a two-week period, parents will report on the characteristics of their social networks and children will report on their beliefs and strategies for coping with adversity. In addition, a number of physiological health measures that assess risk for CVD will be administered to children.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will investigate how key characteristics of parents' social networks interact to predict children's decreased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly by allowing children to develop more effective skills for coping with adversity. Understanding these relationships will be especially important for reducing CVD among children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds because these children are (1) at particular risk for CVD, (2) in families that lack resources, which makes the resources from social networks especially valuable, and (3) especially likely to encounter adversity and therefore in greatest need of effective coping skills to reduce CVD risk.            ",Parents' Dense and Supportive Social Networks Facilitate Children's Health,8780396,F32HL119021,"['Affect ', ' Belief ', ' Biological Characteristics ', ' Biologic Characteristic ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Communities ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Therapeutic Hydrocortisone ', ' Proctocort ', ' Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione, 11,17,21-trihydroxy-, (11beta)- ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Inflammation ', ' Mission ', ' Parents ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Social Network ', ' density ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' psychosocial ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2015,52406,0.1968833141853659
"Diet and metabolic risks: joint drivers of global epidemiologic transition and he     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background - Diet and its effects on metabolic risk factors are key drivers of the global epidemiologic transition. However, few studies have quantitatively assessed the complex interrelationships between dietary and metabolic risk factors, their combined effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes, their associations with macro-socioeconomic variables, and their influence on global health disparities in the context of the epidemiologic transition. Scientific Objectives- 1) To study the inter- relationship between individual dietary and metabolic risk factors in the context of overall diet, 2) To develop sophisticated and robust analytical methods for quantifying the combined effects of diet and metabolic risks on CVD and diabetes, 3) To examine how dietary and metabolic risk factors are influenced by macro- socioeconomic factors such as urbanization, income inequality, and education, and 4) to evaluate how diet, metabolic risk factors, and their relationship to macro-socioeconomic factors contribute to health disparities globally. Scientific and Public Health Impact - This work will provide key insights into the relationships between diet, metabolic risk, and macro-socioeconomic determinants of health and their combined impacts on CVD and diabetes within the context of the global epidemiologic transition. In addition, this research will provide essential new knowledge on how differences in risk factor levels affect global disparities in CVD/diabetes mortality by gender, ethnicity, and age.

"Cardiovascular Disease among Asians and Pacific Islanders (CASPER) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, with total costs (including hypertension) of nearly $300 billion in 2008. The progression of CVD occurs over many years and is influenced by a series of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors that vary across populations. In the US, these factors are least well understood among Asians and Pacific Islanders. Asians are now the fastest-growing minority population in the United States, increasing 43% from 10.2 million to 14.7 million in the past decade.7 Similarly, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations have increased by more than 35% during this same time. While Asian populations in the U.S. are commonly thought to be healthier than other minority groups and non-Hispanic Whites, emerging research suggests that some Asian subgroups and Pacific Islanders might be at higher risk for CVD and associated poor outcomes. With such population growth, the health of these populations will have an increasing impact upon future US public health care needs and costs.  This compelling CVD knowledge gap about API populations has prompted the American Heart Association and the National Lung, Heart and Blood Institute to call for research that will improve the understanding of CVD among API subpopulations.10 To fill this important gap in knowledge about health disparities among API, we will measure CVD prevalence and outcomes among 9 well-defined API populations, and comprehensively assess the role of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors in explaining observed differences in CVD prevalence and outcomes among these groups. The multidisciplinary study team brings broad expertise in epidemiology, cardiovascular disease, and the role of social and psychological factors in health disparities. The study population will be drawn from the membership of two large, integrated health care systems located in different geographic regions with large clusters of Asian and Pacific Islander residents (Hawaii and northern California). The study will leverage the rich detail of more than a decade of clinical data contained within electronic health records (EHR) systems of both health plans. We will also collect patient reported data via a large-scale survey of 10,000 people. The study aims are to: 1. Describe differences in the prevalence of CVD among Asian, Pacific Islander, and mixed-race API subpopulations; 2. Determine whether demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors explain observed differences in CVD prevalence among these populations; and 3.

"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR GENOMIC DISSECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical Methods for Genomic Dissection of Cardiovascular Diseases Abstract This mentored career development grant application proposes a training program to integrate Dr. Sung's previous research in statistical genetics into cardiovascular disease (CVD). Her long-term career goal is to establish herself as an independent statistician in CVD genetics research so that she can more effectively participate in multi-disciplinary research programs with clinical and translational CVD researchers and be better equipped to develop and apply statistical methods to contribute more meaningfully to the field of CVD genetics. This will be achieved through building a strong foundation in the clinical and research aspects of CVD and enhancing her understanding of genomics and whole-genome sequence data. Dr. Sung's mentoring team consists of multi-disciplinary researchers with a strong research track record. Complex cardiometabolic traits including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes contribute to CVD, the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the industrialized world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to many exciting discoveries. However, most GWAS discoveries have not been translated to clinical care because the functional mechanisms underlying the genetic associations remain elusive and the roles played by the environment in modulating these associations remain poorly defined. The research objective of this K25 application is to decipher the genetic and environmental architecture of cardiometabolic traits by incorporating GxE interactions and regulatory annotation information. We hypothesize that joint analysis of the environment, regulatory variants and coding variants will enhance the discovery of putative genetic variants and the functional mechanisms underlying cardiometabolic traits. To evaluate this hypothesis, we aim to identify genetic variants involving GxE interactions and identify putative functional variants by incorporating ENCODE regulation information. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the genetic and environmental architecture of cardiometabolic traits will contribute to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease which may have important implications for personalized medicine.",STATISTICAL METHODS FOR GENOMIC DISSECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,8926464,K25HL121091,"['abstracting ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholest-5-en-3-ol (3beta)- ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' DNase ', ' DNA Nucleases ', ' Deoxyribonucleases ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Dissection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fasting ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Insulin (ox), 8A-L-threonine-10A-L-isoleucine-30B-L-threonine- ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Lipids ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Boston Puerto Rican Health Study - CVD Risk Factors Puerto Rican adults living on the mainland US have documented health disparities; however, little research has been conducted with this second largest Hispanic subgroup. Our long-term goal is to understand the complex interactions of diet and other behavioral and environmental factors, genetics, and psychosocial stress on the high and apparently increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in Puerto Rican adults. As this group is rapidly growing, understanding the reasons for this risk is of great importance. Our initial funding period for the Boston Puerto Rican Center on Population Health and Health Disparities (BPR-CPHHD, 2003-08) focused on the role of stress on physical disability and cognitive decline, through physiological dysregulation or ""allostatic load."" During that investigation, it became clear that risk factors for CVD were highly prevalent. These findings are in contrast to the commonly held belief that there is a Hispanic paradox¿lower heart disease and mortality despite greater poverty. Importantly, the Puerto Rican population differs considerably in ancestral genetic history and in exposures to known risk factors from other Hispanic groups. They have unique dietary intake patterns, as well as social, cultural and environmental structures that contribute and affect reaction to stressors. During our initial funding period, we successfully assembled a cohort of 1450 Puerto Rican adults, aged 45-75 years at baseline, and have completed (to date) more than 900 two-year follow-up interviews¿we are continuing, with the expectation of completing at least 1150. As this population is aging and growing rapidly, the high prevalence and apparent cohort effect of increased heart disease risk factors suggest that 1) this population has serious health disparities in heart disease risk factors and 2) heart disease will become an even greater problem for this group in the near future. Our overall aim for this renewal is, therefore, to extend follow-up and to measure and analyze relevant characteristics and CVD risk factors, and to add additional contextual and outcome measures for CVD risk in this established cohort of Puerto Rican adults, so that we may better understand the dynamics of these disparities. Our model follows the transdisciplinary ""cells to society"" concept developed jointly with our partner CPHHDs during the initial funding period, with consideration of genetic variation in relation to longitudinal change in allostatic load and biochemical indicators of risk, to more concrete indicators of disease (ankle brachial index (ABI) and intima media thickness (IMT)); with additional focus on social networks, neighborhood characteristics (physical space and access to food) and environment (air pollution) factors as social determinants of health. Finally, using community based participatory techniques, we will implement and test a multidimensional intervention that focuses on diet and exercise, but that also fully considers the social and physical environment to ensure success. With participation of our community partner. La Alianza Hispana, and the support of our administrative, biostatistics and laboratory cores, our team is efficiently poised to make significant contributions to understanding the factors that contribute to the apparent growing threat of heart disease in this highly disadvantaged group¿while providing insights that may be useful to other vulnerable groups. The continuation of our cohort, with its rich constellation of measures, will allow us to unravel some of the complex etiologic interactions which contribute to CVD risk, so that effective interventions maybe implemented. This work takes the innovative and necessary approach of examining complex interactions of physiological measures, biological stress, and psychosocial evaluation on multiple levels to understand the causes of disproportionate health disparities in Puerto Ricans.

"Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States and disables 10 million Americans each year. However, CVD risk in the US is higher for African Americans (AAs) relative to European Americans (EAs). In addition to R/E differences in CVD risk, there is extensive data demonstrating that, relative to EAs, AAs have higher rates of poverty and a corresponding increase in exposure to environmental toxicants, including lead (Pb), both in their blood and in their bones. Moreover, studies suggest a positive association between Pb and blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and CVD mortality. The current proposal addresses the question of whether R/E differences in CVD are partially a consequence of corresponding differences in exposure to Pb from the environment. Furthermore, this proposal considers whether these effects might be amplified by R/E differences in psychosocial background, including social control motives, background stress, and racial discrimination. Specifically, our proposal focuses on whether R/E differences in Pb exposure might produce differing rates of CVD risk through underlying alterations in cardiovascular responses to acute psychological stress, a mechanism whereby the psychosocial environment can affect CVD risk. In recent research (Gump, et al., 2011), increasing blood Pb was associated with alterations in cardiac autonomic regulation reflecting ""co-inhibition"" of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity that is typically associated with greater vascular resistance, a cardiovascular pattern we had already observed in children with heightened early childhood blood Pb (Gump, et al., 2005). This vascular response to stress has also been shown to be associated with greater left ventricular mass, a significant predictor of cardiovascular morbidity. Interestingly, a number of studies have noted that AAs respond to psychological stress with a vascular pattern relative to EAs typical cardiac response and are more likely than EAs to develop left ventricular hypertrophy at similar levels of blood pressure, and have greater arterial stiffness as reflected by faster pulse wave velocity. In sum, there is evidence that: 1) AAs (relative to EAs) have higher levels of blood Pb, 2) AAs (relative to EAs) typically respond to stress with a more vascular pattern, as well as greater arterial stiffness and left ventricular mass, and 3) increasing Pb is associated with a heightened vascular response to acute stress. This accumulated evidence provides strong support for testing the hypothesis that R/E differences in Pb exposure might account for R/E differences in cardiovascular patterns of response to acute stress and R/E differences in left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease relative to European Americans, although the reason for this racial health disparity is not understood. Taken together, the racial disparity in lead (Pb) exposure and additional evidence for effects of Pb on cardiovascular functioning suggest a possible mechanism for differences in disease prevalence. As a method to understand the early antecedents of these racial disparities, children represent an important population in which to consider effects of Pb exposure on subclinical CVD outcomes.","Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children",8777958,R01ES023252,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' bone ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' hemodynamics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' K element ', ' Potassium ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Controls ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' United States ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' Measures ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pattern ', ' LV Mass ', ' Left Ventricular Mass ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohesion ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' early childhood ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' Trace metal ', ' social ', ' acute stress ', ' Regulation ', ' blood Pb ', ' blood lead ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Sum ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' diophantine approximation ', ' number theory ', ' ']",NIEHS,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R01,2015,452299,0.10688881752909758

"CVD in American Indians Biomarker lab and Arizona Field Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice.

"Reducing Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Rural Communities in NC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, however African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group. African Americans carry a significant burden of CVD risk factors that often co-occur; this burden is amplified in rural communities. CVD disparities at the intersection of race and geography are driven by individual risk behaviors and complicated by factors such as limited access to quality healthcare, socio-economic inequities, limited healthcare infrastructure and environmental barriers to behavior change. Interventions to ameliorate CVD burden in rural African American communities will require placing the individual in the context of the larger community and taking advantage of new technologies to support behavior change. However, how best to integrate mobile technology into existing evidenced based interventions (EBIs) is still an emerging field and social and physical environmental factors important in rural communities are rarely considered in existing EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by determining the feasibility and efficacy of adapting EBIs to consider the social and physical environment in important in rural African American communities and determining the acceptability of mobile technology in these communities to support behavior change. The proposed study is built on the strong foundation of Project GRACE's 8-year history of designing and testing interventions using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and individual and collaborative expertise in community-based CVD outreach, service and research. We have developed a phased CBPR study with a long-term goal to reduce rates of CVD in Eastern NC. The overall objective of this proposal is to assess feasibility of implementing an EBI, adapted to the needs and interests of a rural community in order to plan a large scale study. To that end our specific aims are to 1) expand and sustain a Project GRACE CVD coalition of community and academic stakeholders to develop successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities; 2) conduct a mixed-method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble, review and assess existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths and resources using a web-based survey of community, faith based, social service and healthcare organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk reduction EBIs and community members' perceptions of possible targets for intervention using focus group interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and facilitators) on acceptability of EBI acceptability; 3) adapt PREMIER, a multi-component EBI using intervention mapping; and 4) conduct a small-scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b) feasibility and adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings. Project Narrative Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US; however, African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group.

"CVD in American Indians  Study and Data Management Center and OK Field Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice.

"Childhood Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: An Intergenerational Approach     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for more than one-third of all U.S. deaths and a major source of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities. Rising child and adolescent obesity rates threaten to erase the prior success of CVD prevention efforts. Without significant improvements in prevention, CVD prevalence is likely to increase by 10%, and related healthcare costs are likely to triple by 2030. Obesity and hypertension are major contributors to CVD risk and major sources of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities over the life course. Low-income African Americans are particularly vulnerable. Despite the availability of: 1) behavioral interventions addressing diet and physical activity as mainstays of obesity and CVD risk reduction, and 2) research evidence suggesting that family-level interventions may be important for eliminating child and adolescent CVD and obesity disparities; most adult CVD risk reduction interventions do not consider family- level effects. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an innovative and effective family-level intervention targeting adolescent family members of African-American (AA) adults at high-risk for CVD. This research will: 1) identify mechanisms by which an individual-level CVD risk reduction intervention can produce family-level effects, 2) yield an innovative family-level intervention that is likely to reduce adolescent CVD and obesity risk among high-risk AA youth, and 3) generate valuable pilot data for a future R01 proposal to inform refinement and evaluation of the family-level intervention developed via this proposal. This research is a critica step in developing effective and innovative family-level interventions with significant positive impacts on CVD and obesity disparities among high-risk adolescents. It also represents a critical next step in the scholarly development of the candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23). The candidate for this K23, Dr. Rachel J. Thornton, is a general pediatrician and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded patient-oriented researcher studying development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of multilevel interventions to eliminate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in child and adolescent CVD and obesity risk. During the award, Dr. Thornton will complete a rigorous program of training, including advanced coursework and practical research. Her proposed activities will occur within the rich training environment of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Johns Hopkins University including the Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Disparities and the Johns Hopkins Global Center on Childhood Obesity. Dr. Thornton will be supported by an exceptional mentoring team, including national and international experts in intervention research, health disparities, CVD, and childhood obesity. Through the proposed K23, Dr. Thornton will develop a solid foundation in CVD epidemiology and intervention research and will be well-equipped to successfully transition into an independent, highly skilled patient-oriented researcher.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are significant racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in child and adolescent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and obesity risk.

"Predicting and Preventing Hospital Readmission in Patients with Diabetes and CVD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to train Daniel J. Rubin, MD, MSc for a career as an independent investigator in the prediction and prevention of hospital readmission among patients with diabetes. Readmissions within 30 days of discharge (30d readmissions) are a high-priority quality measure and target for cost reduction. Patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are disproportionately over- represented in 30d readmissions, especially among racial minorities and urban populations. Currently there is no validated method to identify diabetic patients admitted for CVD at the highest risk of 30d readmission, which is a critical prerequisite for targeting limited resources fr reducing readmission risk to those most in need. Furthermore, there are no proven interventions to reduce the risk of 30d readmission specifically among patients with diabetes. Dr. Rubin plans to address these gaps in knowledge with 2 aims, 1) validating and refining a Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Index (DERRI-CVD) for predicting 30d readmission risk in diabetic patients admitted for CVD, and 2) assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, multifactorial intervention designed to reduce 30d readmissions. The intervention adapts methods successfully used in other inpatient populations to diabetic patients hospitalized for CVD and will target those identified as high risk for readmission based on the DERRI-CVD. There are 2 Phases to the proposed research that address these aims: Phase 1 uses a new retrospective cohort of diabetic patients to validate and refine the DERRI-CVD for prediction of 30d readmission risk; Phase 2 involves a single-arm pilot trial to qualitatively assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. In order to successfully complete the proposed research and build on skills to achieve the overall goal of independence, Dr. Rubin will receive additional training through formal coursework and structured mentorship in the following: validating and refining predictive models, clinical trials, and principles of hospital quality improvement with a focus on readmission prediction and prevention. A distinguished group of senior investigators will serve as mentors and advisors to supervise Dr. Rubin's research and career development. The proposed research and training will help Dr. Rubin acquire skills, establish a body of work in this area and generate preliminary data to support a competitive R01 application to test the readmission risk reduction intervention in a randomized controlled trial. Such work is highly relevant in the current era of soaring health care costs and national health care reform. This proposal will enable Dr. Rubin to develop into a successful independent investigator while improving patient care and reducing readmission disparities through clinical research.     PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge are a common and expensive problem. Patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, especially racial minorities and urban populations, are at particularly high risk of readmission. The proposed research will verify and improve the accuracy of a new tool to predict 30 day readmission risk and explore the feasibility and acceptability of patient education, adjustment of diabetes medications, and coordination of care by specialized nurses and community health workers during and after hospitalization to reduce 30 day readmissions among patients with diabetes hospitalized for cardiovascular disease.        ",Predicting and Preventing Hospital Readmission in Patients with Diabetes and CVD,8891852,K23DK102963,"['Accounting ', ' Boston ', ' Calibration ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Community Health Nursing ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Electronics ', ' Evaluation Research ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lipids ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' statistics ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Training ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Medical center ', ' cohort ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' economic cost ', ' Prevention ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' career development ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' diabetes therapy ', ' diabetes mellitus therapy ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Community Health Nurse ', ' Clinical Specialist in Community Health Nursing ', ' Community Health Nurse Specialist ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Information Technology ', ' Minority ', ' glycemic control ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' diabetic patient ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,K23,2015,171596,0.11575462276076222
"Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease Risk: From Genes to Neighborhoods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are a major public health concern as the leading cause of death and as a major source of racial/ethnic health disparities. Because CVD is a multi-factorial disease, a true understanding of its etiology requires investigations of interactions among many genetic and environmental factors. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to advance our understanding of how multi-level factors (from genes to neighborhoods) synergistically affect CVD. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop measures of neighborhood socioeconomic, built/physical, and social environments, 2) examine cross- sectional and longitudinal associations between genetic and neighborhood factors, and their interactions in relation to CVD risk factors, and 3) examine racial/ethnic differences in CVD risk factors and determine if these differences are explained by neighborhood-gene interactions. These aims will be achieved through the merging of data from the Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health (RPGEH), with data derived from available sources on neighborhoods and the built environment. The RPGEH is one of the largest research resources in the U.S. designed to examine genetic and environmental determinants of common diseases. The candidate, Mahasin Mujahid, is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. The proposed NHLBI Mentored Career Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Mujahid with the unique opportunity to augment her current expertise in general epidemiology, social epidemiology, and population health with new training in cardiovascular pathophysiology, genetic epidemiology, and statistical genetics. Moreover, Dr. Mujahid will receive the necessary support and training to work towards her long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program on the social epidemiology of cardiovascular disease with an emphasis on the underlying biological, genetic, and epigenetic pathways linking social factors to CVD.  (End of Abstract) RELEVANCE: The results of this research project and future studies may enhance our understanding of how factors operating at multiple levels (from genes to neighborhoods) interact to increase CVD risk in multi-ethnic populations.",Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease Risk: From Genes to Neighborhoods,8875743,K01HL115494,"['abstracting ', ' Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Future ', ' Genes ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Mentors ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Publishing ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Time ', ' Training Support ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Measures ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' base ', ' career ', ' racial/ethnic difference ', ' Biological ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' Outcome Study ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' gene interaction ', ' professor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' genetic epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' disease causation ', ' causation ', ' Causality ', ' Etiology ', ' Data ', ' Research Career Program ', ' K-Awards ', ' Career Development Programs K-Series ', ' Career Development Awards and Programs ', ' Career Development Awards ', ' K-Series Research Career Programs ', ' Epigenetic Mechanism ', ' Epigenetic Change ', ' Epigenetic ', ' Epigenetic Process ', ' Other Genetics ', ' Smoking Behavior ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' whole-genome scan ', ' whole genome association study ', ' whole genome association studies ', ' whole genome association analysis ', ' genomewide scan ', ' genomewide association study ', ' genomewide association studies ', ' genomewide association scan ', ' genome-wide scan ', ' genome-wide identification ', ' genome wide studies ', ' genome wide screen ', ' genome wide association studies ', ' genome wide association scan ', ' genome wide association ', ' genome wide analysis ', ' GWAS ', ' genome wide association study ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' administrative data base ', ' administrative database ', ' racial/ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' population health ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,K01,2015,137511,0.11040575253383283
"Social protection, work and family strain: disadvantage effects in US and Europe DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The United States is losing ground in health: our ranking in life expectancy is near the bottom of European countries and comparisons of major chronic conditions in the US and 13 European countries showed the US to have higher disease prevalence than any comparison country. The diverging life expectancy (LE) trends have been most distinct for American women, but the US also fares poorly with regard to male life expectancy and infant mortality. The health gap is largest among socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, but even well- educated Americans have worse health than many of Europeans. We hypothesize that the explanations for the American health disadvantage have roots in the challenging social context faced by families, and in particular women, in post-WWII America. Since WWII, American society has been marked by: high fertility; high female labor market participation; weak labor laws and family protection policies; and family instability, and increased single parenthood. The combination or convergence of these factors created a ""perfect storm"" that threatened vulnerable families and imposed extreme stresses even on the relatively advantaged. Such social conditions might work via influencing health behaviors or through more direct physiological mechanisms. We have developed a theoretical framework for this confluence of conditions that builds on the job strain models incorporating dimensions of demand, control and support but adds an important dimension related to family that extends the strain model beyond work to family life. Over time Americans, especially women, have experienced high demands in terms of full time work often with high family demands, coupled with low formal support ( social protection policies) or informal support from other family members. This combination especially among workers with low job control leads to a cumulative disadvantage taking its toll in health over time. In order to understand whether these social conditions account for cross area variations in risk we must understand whether either the distribution and/or the toxicity of the ""risk"" vary across areas. We draw from ongoing studies including HRS, SHARE and ELSA, mortality data at a country level (using the human mortality files) and data on public policies, collected from the CPS,SIPP and SHARELIFE and OECD. We propose 4 specific aims: Aim 1: Describe the distribution of work-family strain for females born 1920-1960, across the US and EU. Aim 2: Assess the differential toxicity of work-family strain on CVD risk behaviors and biomarkers, incidence of stroke and heart disease, CVD mortality, and life expectancy in the US and Europe. Aim 3: Assess whether distributions or the toxicity of work-family strain explain geographic and temporal variations in CVD and life expectancy. Aim 4: Assess impacts of trends in work-family strain on socioeconomic inequalities in mortality in the US and Europe. With the vast majority of women in the labor force who also have young children and with the aging of societies virtually across the globe, there is an urgent public health need to provide both formal (policy) and informal (family) support to women and their families. Evidence suggests that work family strain has an adverse impact on health outcomes for low wage employees and young children and perhaps other groups. Countries in which a number of work family policies have been implemented seem to fewer adverse population health outcomes. This situation is particularly severe in the US where fertility and labor force participation among women is high and where state and federal policies promoting the health of families is very limited.","Social protection, work and family strain: disadvantage effects in US and Europe",8868874,R01AG040248,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' adult human (21+) ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Americas ', ' Parturition ', ' Birth ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Censuses ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' Child Human ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Conflict ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Divorce ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Occupational Status ', ' Europe ', ' Extended Family ', ' Family ', ' Family Policy ', ' Female ', ' Fecundity ', ' Fecundability ', ' Fertility ', ' Flooding ', ' Floods ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Household ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Postneonatal Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Labor Forces ', ' Laws ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' male ', ' Maps ', ' Marketing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mothers ', ' Professional Positions ', ' Jobs ', ' Occupations ', ' Poverty ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Public Policy ', ' Records ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Salaries ', ' Wages ', ' Smoking ', ' Social transformation ', ' Social modification ', ' Social Change ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Societies ', ' Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Parental Leave ', ' Family member ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Unmarried ', ' Caring ', ' work setting ', ' work environment ', ' Worksite ', ' Work-Site ', ' Work Place ', ' Work Location ', ' Job Site ', ' Job Setting ', ' Job Place ', ' Job Location ', ' Job Environment ', ' Workplace ', ' human mortality ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' Data Files ', ' data repository ', ' clinical data repository ', ' Electronic Database ', ' Electronic Databank ', ' Databanks ', ' Data Bases ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databases ', ' Policies ', ' Social Protection ', ' Inequality ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Equus asinus ', ' Donkey ', ' Asses ', ' Life ', ' Hour ', ' Dimensions ', ' Pattern ', ' Country ', ' Tobacco Consumption ', ' Tobacco use ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' early childhood ', ' cohort ', ' Employee ', ' Family Health ', ' Family health status ', ' Toxicities ', ' Toxic effect ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Meta-Analyses ', ' Data Pooling ', ' Clinical Trial Overviews ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Subepithelial Photorefractive Keratectomy ', ' Laser-Assisted Sub-Epithelial Keratomileusis ', ' Laser Subepithelial Keratomileusis ', ' LASEK ', ' Keratomileusis, Subepithelial, Laser-Assisted ', ' Excimer Laser Subepithelial Abalation ', ' ELSA ', ' Keratectomy, Subepithelial, Laser-Assisted ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' trend ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' labor force participation ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' Coupled ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' federal policy ', ' population health ', ' flexible ', ' flexibility ', ' ']",NIA,HARVARD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH,R01,2015,285054,0.06254482448749502
"Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Risk for CVD and Stroke in the Jackson Heart Study     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite national initiatives to address health disparities, African Americans (AAs) suffer higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially stroke, than European Americans (EAs). The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was established in 2000 with the aim of generating data that would support public health recommendations for reducing CVD disparities in AAs. This landmark study has reported a higher prevalence of diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension in this entirely AA cohort compared to other U.S. mostly EA cohorts. Increased risk factor prevalence is not explained by obesity or other traditional risk factors, suggesting a potential role for additional unmeasured factors in influencing adverse cardio- metabolic outcomes. Although JHS has comprehensively assessed a wide variety of CVD risk factors, a notable gap has been the absences of objective assessment of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep patterns. The importance of rectifying this gap is underscored by recent research from predominantly EA samples that have demonstrated that SDB and insufficient sleep each are associated with increased incidence of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Our preliminary data also indicate that SDB may be more prevalent in the entirely AA JHS cohort than in predominantly white cohorts. Our long-range goal is to ameliorate CVD disparities by identifying ethnicity-specific modifiable risk factors. The proposed study will examine relationships among SDB, insufficient sleep, obesity, psycho- socio-cultural variables, and CVD risk factors in 1,200 members of the JHS cohort. Sleep apnea and sleep patterns will be objectively assessed using low burden but reliable in-home sleep apnea monitoring and wrist actigraphy. To assess intermediate measurements of CVD, particularly related to stroke and diabetes, intimal media thickness (IMT), blood pressure, and biochemical indices of glucose control and inflammation will be obtained using rigorous protocols. These data will be used to achieve three specific aims: (1) Identify risk factors for SDB and insufficient sleep in AAs, including novel measurements of major and minor stress and negative emotions relevant to minority populations; (2) Elucidate relationships between SDB severity, insufficient sleep, and risk for uncontrolled hypertension, stroke and diabetes; and (3) Quantify the extent to which SDB may statistically mediate relationships between obesity and traditional CVD risk factors. Our study will identify the role of sleep disorders as novel modifiabe risk factors for CVD in AAs, provide a basis for promoting better screening for SDB, and enhance scientific understanding of how disparities in stroke and intermediate CVD outcomes such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are impacted by sleep disorders. Finally, the results of our study will serve as the foundation for prospective analyses linking SDB to incident CVD events, morbidity, and mortality in AAs.          The proposed study will help us better understand how sleep disorders and too little sleep contribute to the risk for stroke, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in African Americans. The data gathered by this study will help researchers develop future targeted health interventions to reduce the public health burden of cardiovascular disease and racial disparities in diabetes, hypertension and stroke.

"CVD in American Indians:  Imaging and Cardiovascular Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 �15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes.

"CVD in American Indians Genetics Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice.

"Dietary Flavonoids in Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the leading cause of death since 1935 and it is anticipated that by 2030, about 40% of the US population will suffer from some type of cardiovascular disease. The burden of cognitive decline, which has been linked to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, is also expected to rise as the US population ages. Cardiovascular disease risk factors present in midlife have been associated with cognitive decline in older ages. Inflammatory and oxidative processes have been proposed as underlying mechanisms that may link CVD and cognitive decline. Measures that can protect against or mitigate CVD and cognitive decline are of great importance to public health. Diets high in plant-based foods, such as the Mediterranean diet, have been associated with a lower incidence of acute coronary heart disease, stroke events, and cognitive impairment. Flavonoids, which are bioactive, non-nutrient, polyphenolic compounds found in vascular plants, may explain some of the protective effects of plant-based diets. Several protective mechanisms have been proposed, based on the pleiotropic nature of flavonoids, which include antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties. Previous epidemiologic studies have yielded mixed evidence regarding the strength of the association between increased flavonoid intake and cardiovascular health. The overarching goal of this research proposal is to evaluate the role of dietary flavonoids in the development of CVD and cognitive impairment. Using data from the REasons for Geographic and Regional Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study (n=30,0000), we will evaluate the association between dietary flavonoid intake and incident CVD and incident cognitive impairment. Using data from the Mental Stress Ischemia: Prognosis and Genetic Influences (MIPS) study (n=650), we will evaluate the association between dietary flavonoid intake and recurrent CVD. Results from the proposed research will clarify the role of dietary flavonoids in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease. Also, the results will address gaps in knowledge about the associations of interest in non-Hispanic black populations. This information will be useful in public health interventions seeking to reduce CVD burden and disparities in CVD disease. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE:     Project Narrative Diets high in fruits, vegetables and other foods from plant sources, like tea and tofu, are linked to fewer heart attacks, strokes and less cognitive decline. Eating more flavonoids, which are naturally produced by plants that we eat, may explain why plant-based foods are protective, but scientific evidence to support this is still inconclusive, especially in males and non-Hispanic blacks in the United States. This study seeks to clarify whether eating more flavonoids provides protection against first and recurrent heart disease and strokes as well as protection against cognitive decline in the United States.",Dietary Flavonoids in Cardiovascular and Cognitive Health,8927332,F31AG048719,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Antiinflammatory Agents ', ' Antiinflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatories ', ' Anti-Inflammatory Agents ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Antioxidants ', ' Hemato-Encephalic Barrier ', ' Blood-Brain Barrier ', ' Blood - brain barrier anatomy ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system (all sites) ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' disease/disorder ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Food Intake ', ' Eating ', ' Food ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' hippocampal ', ' Hippocampus ', ' Cornu Ammonis ', ' Ammon Horn ', ' Hippocampus (Brain) ', ' Incidence ', ' Inflammation ', ' Ischemia ', ' Learning ', ' male ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Patients ', ' Plants ', ' Food Plants ', ' Edible Plants ', ' Prognosis ', ' outcome forecast ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Tea ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' base ', ' Acute ', ' Link ', ' mental ', ' Psyche structure ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Genetic ', ' Inflammatory ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Tofu ', ' Soy Bean Curd ', ' disease severity ', ' Severity of illness ', ' neurodegenerative illness ', ' degenerative neurological diseases ', ' degenerative diseases of motor and sensory neurons ', ' Neurologic Degenerative Conditions ', ' Neurodegenerative Diseases ', ' Neuro-degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural degenerative Disorders ', ' Neural Degenerative Diseases ', ' Nervous System Degenerative Diseases ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Disorders ', ' Degenerative Neurologic Diseases ', ' Neurodegenerative Disorders ', ' interest ', ' 2-Phenyl-Chromenes ', ' 2-Phenyl-Benzopyrans ', ' Flavonoids ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' regional difference ', ' Tracheophyta ', ' Higher Plants ', ' Vascular Plant ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' LOINC Axis 2 Property ', ' Property ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Mediterranean Diet ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Plant Sources ', ' Supplementation ', ' Anti-inflammatory ', ' Cognitive ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Dietary Flavonoid ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Minority ', ' LDL oxidation ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein oxidation ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' prospective ', ' protective effect ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' population based ', ' ']",NIA,EMORY UNIVERSITY,F31,2015,42165,0.052115545542061076
"Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Risk for CVD and Stroke in the Jackson Heart Study DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Despite national initiatives to address health disparities, African Americans (AAs) suffer higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially stroke, than European Americans (EAs). The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) was established in 2000 with the aim of generating data that would support public health recommendations for reducing CVD disparities in AAs. This landmark study has reported a higher prevalence of diabetes and uncontrolled hypertension in this entirely AA cohort compared to other U.S. mostly EA cohorts. Increased risk factor prevalence is not explained by obesity or other traditional risk factors, suggesting a potential role for additional unmeasured factors in influencing adverse cardio- metabolic outcomes. Although JHS has comprehensively assessed a wide variety of CVD risk factors, a notable gap has been the absences of objective assessment of sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep patterns. The importance of rectifying this gap is underscored by recent research from predominantly EA samples that have demonstrated that SDB and insufficient sleep each are associated with increased incidence of coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Our preliminary data also indicate that SDB may be more prevalent in the entirely AA JHS cohort than in predominantly white cohorts. Our long-range goal is to ameliorate CVD disparities by identifying ethnicity-specific modifiable risk factors. The proposed study will examine relationships among SDB, insufficient sleep, obesity, psycho- socio-cultural variables, and CVD risk factors in 1,200 members of the JHS cohort. Sleep apnea and sleep patterns will be objectively assessed using low burden but reliable in-home sleep apnea monitoring and wrist actigraphy. To assess intermediate measurements of CVD, particularly related to stroke and diabetes, intimal media thickness (IMT), blood pressure, and biochemical indices of glucose control and inflammation will be obtained using rigorous protocols. These data will be used to achieve three specific aims: (1) Identify risk factors for SDB and insufficient sleep in AAs, including novel measurements of major and minor stress and negative emotions relevant to minority populations; (2) Elucidate relationships between SDB severity, insufficient sleep, and risk for uncontrolled hypertension, stroke and diabetes; and (3) Quantify the extent to which SDB may statistically mediate relationships between obesity and traditional CVD risk factors. Our study will identify the role of sleep disorders as novel modifiabe risk factors for CVD in AAs, provide a basis for promoting better screening for SDB, and enhance scientific understanding of how disparities in stroke and intermediate CVD outcomes such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia are impacted by sleep disorders. Finally, the results of our study will serve as the foundation for prospective analyses linking SDB to incident CVD events, morbidity, and mortality in AAs. The proposed study will help us better understand how sleep disorders and too little sleep contribute to the risk for stroke, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease in African Americans. The data gathered by this study will help researchers develop future targeted health interventions to reduce the public health burden of cardiovascular disease and racial disparities in diabetes, hypertension and stroke.",Sleep-Disordered Breathing and Risk for CVD and Stroke in the Jackson Heart Study,8972674,R01HL110068,"['Affect ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Anatomical Sciences ', ' Anatomic ', ' Anatomy ', ' angry ', ' angers ', ' Anger ', ' Anxiety ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination (Psychology) ', ' Emotions ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Dextrose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Glucose ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' Household ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Interleukin 6 (Interferon, Beta 2) ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 (B cell stimulating factor 2) ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' Minor ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"The Taxi Network     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There are over 230,000 taxi drivers in the U.S. and 42,000 in New York City (NYC), where 84% are immigrant. Taxi drivers are at great risk for poor health, with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) and overlapping cancer risk, due to stress, diet, sedentary lifestyle, environmental exposures, and poor health care access. The taxi driver community, while facing tremendous health risk, also has notable assets to facilitate the health of its drivers. Community networks have the potential to disseminate health risk reduction information and strategies. The overall goal of this Taxi Network proposal is to create a robust community- based participatory research (CBPR) infrastructure that taps into the many assets of the taxi driver community, to work towards the elimination of health disparities in this large a-risk group. The specific aims include: 1. To develop a robust, enduring, fluid CBPR program with the large NYC taxi driver community, co- led by community and scientific research partners, with an active Taxi CAB (Community Advisory/Action Board), and Advisory and Steering Committees, to create a platform for co-learning, sharing resources and dissemination of outreach, education, service delivery, research, and policy action projects, to improve the cardiovascular health of this large at-risk community. 2. To work with the Taxi CAB to use a mixed methods approach of focus groups, key informant interviews, questionnaires, social network analysis, and resource mapping to conduct a detailed analysis of the health-related priorities, needs and assets of the taxi driver community, and the potential points and methods of intervention. 3.To design and pilot a CBPR CVD risk reduction pedometer exercise study, tailored to reflect the unique circumstances of the taxi driver community and capitalizing on assets such as their social networks and the window of opportunity of the airport holding lot. Taxi Network has been developed through an ongoing, iterative process with the community, and builds upon extensive preliminary work in this area.

People of all ages and backgrounds can get the condition and one in three deaths (approximately 800,000) are reported each year in the US. Annual direct and overall costs resulting from CVD are estimated at $273 billion and $444 billion, respectively. Strategies that address leading CVD risk factors such as hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and smoking, can greatly reduce the burden of CVD. About half of Americans (49%) have at least one of these three risk factors. Several other medical conditions and lifestyle choices can also put people at a higher risk for heart disease, including, diabetes, overweight and obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol use. Nearly one-third of adults in the US are obese and overweight which affects physical, social, and quality of life and is a major influence on the development of CVD. However, the need for treatment is highest among low-income and ethnic minority populations who have a high burden of obesity but less access to healthcare services. Obesity is a significant risk factor for CVD and continues to be a leading cause of death in disproportionately African American (AA) communities in the US. Although the manifest of the disease in childhood and adolescence is rare, risk factors and risk behaviors that accelerate the development of atherosclerosis begins at childhood according to the NHLBI Expert Panel for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents. The disparities are prominent in youth, given that 70% of overweight youth will remain overweight as adults, it is imperative that innovative approaches be developed early in life to prevent obesity and CVD. Sixty three percent of the students enrolled (current enrollment of 5400) at Winston-Salem State University (WSSU), are overweight and at risk for CVD. Although studies regarding health issues and the obesity epidemic have increased in recent years, few of these studies target college-aged students. The proposed intervention may have a major impact on the overall and future health outcomes of WSSU students. We aim to: 1)To assess CVD risk factors among AA college students by examining blood markers and anthropometric measurements, and 2) pilot test a 15-week CVD risk prevention and intervention program administered as a 2-credit hour semester long CVD intervention course versus a comparison course among two cohorts (50 per cohort) of AA college students at WSSU. We hypothesize that, compared to the control group; students enrolled in the evidence- based CVD health curriculum course will have improved health behaviors (increased fruit and vegetable intake, physical activity participation, cardiovascular fitness, sleep quality, and stress reductio), anthropometric measurements (BMI and waist circumference), and blood markers (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and glucose).         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This study involves the development and pilot testing of a CVD prevention and intervention program using the Health Belief Model as a framework towards implementation of a didactic, evidence-based semester long 15-week CVD prevention and intervention curriculum focusing on knowledge of CVD risk factors, diet and physical activity, and web-based health resources. The study will employ tools for self-monitoring/ self-motivating for healthy behaviors that support the transition of traditional teaching methods to e-learning. Methodology includes the assessment of CVD risk factors among 100 AA college students by examining blood markers and anthropometric measurements; and the pilot testing of a 15-week CVD risk prevention and intervention program administered as a 2-credit hour semester long CVD intervention course versus a comparison course. The successful data collection in this ethnic community will give an insight to the concepts of CVD manifestation among AA college age students. CVD prevention in AA college-age students also has the goal of preventing obesity- related co-morbidities that develop during adulthood; and if successful, this approach could be applied to other settings with populations at high risk for CVD and its complications, thereby, the potential for generalizability and impact is high.            ",Accessing CVD Risk Factors Among African American

"Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self-management skills (TABLETS) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Though rates of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD) have declined the risk of CVD events increased among those with diabetes. Clinical trials have shown behavioral lifestyle interventions are effective at decreasing CVD risk and decreasing CVD-related deaths among those with diabetes. Face-to-face interventions are labor and cost intensive, but may not be more effective than alternative modes of delivery, especially where access and transportation are a significant problem. Studies have shown that telephone- delivered interventions are effective but, more importantly, that patients likely prefer health education via a technology modality. The telephone (either landline or cell phone) is highly accessible for low-income populations. Yet, there is little data on the effectiveness of CVD risk reduction interventions using a novel tablet-based approach among high-risk, low-income African Americans (AA) with diabetes. This study will determine the effectiveness of a multi-component, Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self- management (TABLETS) intervention on changing behavioral (chronic disease self-management) and clinical outcomes (CVD risk) given the needs of a low-income minority population with diabetes at high risk for CVD. We propose a pilot randomized clinical trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-driven, multi- component TABLET intervention on improving behavioral outcomes (activity, diet, medication adherence, self-monitoring) and clinical outcomes in high-risk, low-income AAs with diabetes. The primary outcome is change in CVD risk behaviors at 6 months of follow-up and secondary outcomes are glycemic control (A1c), blood pressure, and lipids as well as quality of life. The proposed novel approach will maximize the effectiveness and impact of the intervention by implementing tablet-based videoconferencing as an enhancement of the intervention. This study targets a high-priority research area - disparate burden of type 2 diabetes, resulting from poor self- management. The long-term goal of this application is to test novel approaches to lifestyle behavior change that reduce CVD complications and mortality, and eliminate health disparities in high-risk, low-income AA adults with diabetes. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Racial/ethnic differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors show African Americans (AA) have up to a two-fold risk of poor control of glycemia, blood pressure, and lipids compared to Whites. Several studies have shown at least equivalent effectiveness of computer-aided, telehealth, and mobile-enabled interventions on improving chronic disease self-management. The proposed study is a logical progression of an earlier study and provides opportunity for the PI (a new, minority investigator) to extend the experience from the diversity supplement to CVD risk reduction in AAs with T2DM using novel technology. This study provides a unique opportunity to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-driven, Tablet-Aided BehavioraL intervention EffecT on Self-management (TABLETS) in AAs with diabetes, using real-time videoconferencing technology for education and skills training, on chronic disease self-management behaviors and CVD risk among a high- risk, low-income AA population.

"Parents' Dense and Supportive Social Networks Facilitate Children's Health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Socioeconomic status (SES) powerfully influences one's health.1 Considerable gaps exist, with childhood SES serving as an especially important factor in determining health throughout the lifespan.2, 3 The proposed research's broad objective is to understand how a family's social context-namely, the nature of the social network in which parents are embedded-relates to children's cardiovascular health. This question will be explored with a particular focus on lower SES families, whose children are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD).4, 5 Past research has found that strong social support is associated with lower CVD risk (and other positive health outcomes).6 Here we suggest that when parents have effective social networks, children will be able to develop effective skills for coping with adversity, which will in turn, reduce their CVD risk. Specifically, the research tests the novel hypotheses that social networks that are (1) dense (i.e., a community where many people know each other and have a strong sense of obligation to assist others) and (2) provide more assistance than they require in return (i.e., so that they provide support, on balance, rather than draining already scarce resources) will be most effective at helping children develop effective coping skills and reduce children's CVD risk. Such networks' capacity to provide additional resources will be especially important in lower SES families, where resources are often lacking. If a child's parents have more social, emotional, and material resources from their networks, the child will be more likely to develop beliefs that, as previous research suggests, wil help to reduce their CVD risk. Such beliefs will be especially valuable for lower SES children, who are especially likely to encounter adversity. Since the proposed project aims to reduce CVD risk, particularly among those at the greatest risk (i.e., lower SES children), it pertains directl to NHLBI's mission of preventing heart disease.  The proposed research will be part of a larger research project in which 250 families (parents and children) of a range of SES backgrounds will participate. In surveys administered at the beginning of the study and then each day over a two-week period, parents will report on the characteristics of their social networks and children will report on their beliefs and strategies for coping with adversity. In addition, a number of physiological health measures that assess risk for CVD will be administered to children. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: This project will investigate how key characteristics of parents' social networks interact to predict children's decreased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly by allowing children to develop more effective skills for coping with adversity. Understanding these relationships will be especially important for reducing CVD among children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds because these children are (1) at particular risk for CVD, (2) in families that lack resources, which makes the resources from social networks especially valuable, and (3) especially likely to encounter adversity and therefore in greatest need of effective coping skills to reduce CVD risk.",Parents' Dense and Supportive Social Networks Facilitate Children's Health,8969691,F32HL119021,"['Affect ', ' Belief ', ' Biological Characteristics ', ' Biologic Characteristic ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' Child Health ', ' Child health care ', ' Communities ', ' Emotions ', ' Environment ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Family ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Proctocort ', ' Nutracort ', ' Hytone ', ' Hydrocortone ', ' Eldecort ', ' Dermacort ', ' Cortril ', ' Cortispray ', ' Cortisol ', ' Cortenema ', ' Cortef ', ' Cort-Dome ', ' Cetacort ', ' Aeroseb-HC ', ' Hydrocortisone ', ' Inflammation ', ' Mission ', ' Parents ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Testing ', ' Measures ', ' Coping Skills ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Youth ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Social Network ', ' density ', ' Biological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Link ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Attenuated ', ' Shapes ', ' Nature ', ' psychosocial ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' Emotional ', ' Sampling ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Outcome ', ' coping ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' support network ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY,F32,2016,51083,0.1968833141853659
"CVD in American Indians  Study and Data Management Center and OK Field Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice.

"Childhood Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: An Intergenerational Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for more than one-third of all U.S. deaths and a major source of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities. Rising child and adolescent obesity rates threaten to erase the prior success of CVD prevention efforts. Without significant improvements in prevention, CVD prevalence is likely to increase by 10%, and related healthcare costs are likely to triple by 2030. Obesity and hypertension are major contributors to CVD risk and major sources of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities over the life course. Low-income African Americans are particularly vulnerable. Despite the availability of: 1) behavioral interventions addressing diet and physical activity as mainstays of obesity and CVD risk reduction, and 2) research evidence suggesting that family-level interventions may be important for eliminating child and adolescent CVD and obesity disparities; most adult CVD risk reduction interventions do not consider family- level effects. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an innovative and effective family-level intervention targeting adolescent family members of African-American (AA) adults at high-risk for CVD. This research will: 1) identify mechanisms by which an individual-level CVD risk reduction intervention can produce family-level effects, 2) yield an innovative family-level intervention that is likely to reduce adolescent CVD and obesity risk among high-risk AA youth, and 3) generate valuable pilot data for a future R01 proposal to inform refinement and evaluation of the family-level intervention developed via this proposal. This research is a critica step in developing effective and innovative family-level interventions with significant positive impacts on CVD and obesity disparities among high-risk adolescents. It also represents a critical next step in the scholarly development of the candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23). The candidate for this K23, Dr. Rachel J. Thornton, is a general pediatrician and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded patient-oriented researcher studying development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of multilevel interventions to eliminate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in child and adolescent CVD and obesity risk. During the award, Dr. Thornton will complete a rigorous program of training, including advanced coursework and practical research. Her proposed activities will occur within the rich training environment of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Johns Hopkins University including the Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Disparities and the Johns Hopkins Global Center on Childhood Obesity. Dr. Thornton will be supported by an exceptional mentoring team, including national and international experts in intervention research, health disparities, CVD, and childhood obesity. Through the proposed K23, Dr. Thornton will develop a solid foundation in CVD epidemiology and intervention research and will be well-equipped to successfully transition into an independent, highly skilled patient-oriented researcher. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: There are significant racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in child and adolescent cardiovascular disease (CVD) and obesity risk. Rising rates of child and adolescent obesity threaten to reverse improvements in CVD prevention and contribute to persistent disparities in CVD.

"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR GENOMIC DISSECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical Methods for Genomic Dissection of Cardiovascular Diseases Abstract This mentored career development grant application proposes a training program to integrate Dr. Sung's previous research in statistical genetics into cardiovascular disease (CVD). Her long-term career goal is to establish herself as an independent statistician in CVD genetics research so that she can more effectively participate in multi-disciplinary research programs with clinical and translational CVD researchers and be better equipped to develop and apply statistical methods to contribute more meaningfully to the field of CVD genetics. This will be achieved through building a strong foundation in the clinical and research aspects of CVD and enhancing her understanding of genomics and whole-genome sequence data. Dr. Sung's mentoring team consists of multi-disciplinary researchers with a strong research track record. Complex cardiometabolic traits including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes contribute to CVD, the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the industrialized world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to many exciting discoveries. However, most GWAS discoveries have not been translated to clinical care because the functional mechanisms underlying the genetic associations remain elusive and the roles played by the environment in modulating these associations remain poorly defined. The research objective of this K25 application is to decipher the genetic and environmental architecture of cardiometabolic traits by incorporating GxE interactions and regulatory annotation information. We hypothesize that joint analysis of the environment, regulatory variants and coding variants will enhance the discovery of putative genetic variants and the functional mechanisms underlying cardiometabolic traits. To evaluate this hypothesis, we aim to identify genetic variants involving GxE interactions and identify putative functional variants by incorporating ENCODE regulation information. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Understanding the genetic and environmental architecture of cardiometabolic traits will contribute to our knowledge of the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease which may have important implications for personalized medicine.",STATISTICAL METHODS FOR GENOMIC DISSECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES,9097415,K25HL121091,"['abstracting ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' DNase ', ' DNA Nucleases ', ' Deoxyribonucleases ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Dissection ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Elements ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Family ', ' fasts ', ' fasted ', ' Fasting ', ' Foundations ', ' Genes ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Haplotypes ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Regular Insulin ', ' Novolin R ', ' Humulin R ', ' Insulin ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Lipids ', ' alpha-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' HDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' HDL Cholesterol ', ' High Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' beta-Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol ', ' LDL Cholesterol Lipoproteins ', ' Maps ', ' Mentors ', ' statistical linear models ', ' statistical linear mixed models ', ' Probability Models ', ' Probabilistic Models ', ' Statistical Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Cardiovascular Disease Among Asians and Pacific Islanders (CASPER) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, with total costs (including hypertension) of nearly $300 billion in 2008. The progression of CVD occurs over many years and is influenced by a series of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors that vary across populations. In the US, these factors are least well understood among Asians and Pacific Islanders. Asians are now the fastest-growing minority population in the United States, increasing 43% from 10.2 million to 14.7 million in the past decade.7 Similarly, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations have increased by more than 35% during this same time. While Asian populations in the U.S. are commonly thought to be healthier than other minority groups and non-Hispanic Whites, emerging research suggests that some Asian subgroups and Pacific Islanders might be at higher risk for CVD and associated poor outcomes. With such population growth, the health of these populations will have an increasing impact upon future US public health care needs and costs.  This compelling CVD knowledge gap about API populations has prompted the American Heart Association and the National Lung, Heart and Blood Institute to call for research that will improve the understanding of CVD among API subpopulations.10 To fill this important gap in knowledge about health disparities among API, we will measure CVD prevalence and outcomes among 9 well-defined API populations, and comprehensively assess the role of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors in explaining observed differences in CVD prevalence and outcomes among these groups. The multidisciplinary study team brings broad expertise in epidemiology, cardiovascular disease, and the role of social and psychological factors in health disparities. The study population will be drawn from the membership of two large, integrated health care systems located in different geographic regions with large clusters of Asian and Pacific Islander residents (Hawaii and northern California). The study will leverage the rich detail of more than a decade of clinical data contained within electronic health records (EHR) systems of both health plans. We will also collect patient reported data via a large-scale survey of 10,000 people. The study aims are to: 1. Describe differences in the prevalence of CVD among Asian, Pacific Islander, and mixed-race API subpopulations; 2. Determine whether demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors explain observed differences in CVD prevalence among these populations; and 3. Describe differences in CVD outcomes among these populations, including quality of life, and determine whether demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors explain observed differences.  Study results will provide important new evidence about underlying factors associated with CVD prevalence and outcomes among rapidly growing, diverse populations in the U.S. This information will provide strategic guidance for targeted interventions at multiple levels-provider, patient, and health system-to reduce CVD mortality and morbidity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of this study will provide important new information about the underlying causes of disparities in cardiovascular disease among a rapidly growing segment of the US population, Asians and Pacific Islanders, with findings potentially relevant to other minority populations. Study results will have practical utility in the strategic design of interventions to improve primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease among Asian and Pacific Islander populations.",Cardiovascular Disease Among Asians and Pacific Islanders (CASPER),9265351,R01HL126172,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Planning ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Population Growth ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Research Design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' Peripheral Vascular Diseases ', ' peripheral blood vessel disorder ', ' Peripheral Vascular Disorder ', ' Peripheral Angiopathies ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' experience ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Health system ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' study population ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2016,81896,0.17425038071217888
"Ten-Day Seminar on the Epidemiology and Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease This proposal requests joint sponsorship of the US Ten-Day Seminar on Epidemiology and Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases, a unique training program to include NHLBI, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Heart Association. Given the burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and stroke to this nation in terms of disability, death, disparities, and costs, this focus area is highly appropriate as a setting for professional training in research and dissemination of evidence supporting improved prevention and patient outcomes. Securing availability of such a workforce is a key element of our country's readiness to address the public health and medical challenges posed by CVD and to take on the new endeavor of improving cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH population and clinical scientists will increasingly need an understanding of methods related to e-cohorts, large practical trials, quality of care research, dissemination and implementation (D&I) research, and big data analytics. The recent emphasis of funding agencies on cost- effective research has led to the need to develop new methods to conduct observational studies and trials. Greatly increased scale of clinical and population data sources can be harnessed to enhance quality of care and population health, but this also places new demands on population and clinical scientists in CVD and CVH research. Biomedical informatics expertise is needed with application to data from electronic health records and public health information sources, including data regarding the physical and social environments. Research competencies are needed in epidemiology and biostatistics, quality of care, and policy and environmental approaches to health promotion and disease prevention. Scientists are needed who can integrate evidence across all of these fields and translate research findings into effective and impactful policy and practice, and the US Seminar contributes uniquely to this training need. The following specific actions must be pursued in order to assure the conduct of a successful Seminar: 1. We continue to attract a faculty with both the knowledge of relevant content and the personal teaching  skills required for the effective conduct of this program, with a continuing emphasis on the recruitment of  minority and female faculty members (currently comprising 43% of the faculty); 2. We continue to adapt program content to maintain its currency and relevance to the training needs of the  nation for health professionals with appropriate career interests, while maintaining a consistent central  focus on the areas described above; 3. We continue to disseminate information about this program to appropriate target groups, using the most  effective current strategies for reaching minority and female candidates; and 4. We continue to broaden the recruitment of participants, through the structure of the AHA Scientific  Councils and additional means. This proposal requests joint sponsorship of a unique training program to include NHLBI, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the American Heart Association. This program, established in 1975 and offered annually to the present time, is the US Ten-Day Seminar on Epidemiology and Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases. Given the immense burden of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and stroke to this nation in terms of disability, death, disparities, and costs, this focus area is highly appropriate as a setting for professional training in research and dissemination of evidence supporting improved prevention and patient outcomes.

"Comparative Effectiveness Evaluation of a Diabetes Case Management Intervention in AI/AN Communities PROJECT SUMMARY  The long-term goal of this project is to address the striking disparities in diabetes and its complications that American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) face. To achieve this goal, effective strategies for diabetes management and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction are urgently needed to decrease morbidity and mortality among AI/ANs and to improve their overall health and quality of life. Case management is an important approach to enhance traditional health care delivery for people at elevated risk of adverse outcomes. It holds great promise for alleviating the heavy diabetes and CVD burden among AI/ANs and other minority populations. However, how to effectively implement this intervention in the real-world settings of large and diverse communities remains unclear. The proposed study will comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Heart demonstration project of Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI-HH), a cardiovascular risk reduction project using an intensive case management (ICM) approach. The efficacy of the ICM approach was already well established, thus, SDPI-HH was designed as a translational project without a control group. The effectiveness of the intervention has been evaluated as a pre- and post-test design which, albeit necessary and informative, provides only a partial assessment of the program's ability to manage diabetes and its complications. In this proposal, the SDPI-HH data will be combined with 2 targeted sources, the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit data and the data form the Look AHEAD trial, a randomized trial comparing the impacts of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and diabetes support education (DSE) on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with diabetes. The specific aims of this project are: (1) Using IHS Audit data, to broaden the understanding of SDPI-HH effectiveness by comparing the trends of diabetes quality of care between HH and non-HH facilities from 1998 to 2013; (2) Using data from the Look AHEAD trial and employing a propensity score matching approach, to compare the effectiveness of SDPI ICM intervention with the Look AHEAD ILI and DSE approaches among patients with diabetes. Our proposed analytic strategy has the potential to reduce or eliminate potential biases present in one arm pre- and post-test design that are frequently the only option in community-based translational intervention initiatives. Not only will the resulting findings provide critical guidance as we seek to reduce CVD risks among AI/ANs with diabetes, they will also demonstrate ways in which publicly available public health surveillance and/or historical control data may assist in evaluating similar community-based interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The aims of this project are to compare the effectiveness of a diabetes case management intervention implemented in a diverse set AI/AN communities with other interventions implemented in another public health program or a clinical trial setting targeting at similar outcome variables. The work proposed here promises to provide important knowledge about how to successfully implement diabetes case management intervention in the real-world settings of AI/AN communities in the future and to reduce the daunting disparities in diabetes and its complications such as cardiovascular disease that are borne by AI/ANs and other underserved populations eventually.",Comparative Effectiveness Evaluation of a Diabetes Case Management Intervention in AI/AN Communities,9180628,R21DK108187,"['Affect ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' meeting reports ', ' Congresses ', ' Control Groups ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Medical Records ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health Surveillance ', ' Population Surveillance ', ' Pre-Post Tests ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Public Health Schools ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' Strikes ', ' Employee Strikes ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' United States Indian Health Service ', ' Indian Health Service ', ' Case Management ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Caring ', ' Journals ', ' Magazine ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Diabetic Complications ', ' Diabetes-Related Complications ', ' Diabetes Complications ', ' Complications of Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Investigation ', ' Source ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' Performance ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaska Native ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Sampling ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' repository ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' NIDDK ', ' National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Monitor ', ' trend ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' diabetic management ', ' diabetes management ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' lifestyle intervention ', ' life style intervention ', ' trial comparing ', ' comparative effectiveness ', ' compare effectiveness ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' adverse outcome ', ' adverse consequence ', ' arm ', ' ']",NIDDK,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE,R21,2016,231750,0.08455042146407826
"Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K24 renewal is for Dr. Corbie-Smith to establish a premier research infrastructure to provide exceptional training for the next generation of CVD researchers who address the health and healthcare of patients who bear a disproportionate burden of CVD morbidity and mortality. Dr. Corbie-Smith has made excellent use of the support provided in the first cycle of her K24. She has been highly productive, with an impressive trajectory of peer-reviewed publications in the emerging field of community engaged research. She has been successful in funding her work, obtaining a new R01 grant focused on dissemination of an evidence based intervention to reduce CVD risk in rural African American populations. She has mentored her first trainees to independence, and new trainees she has mentored with her K24 support have been successful in terms of publications and funding. She has successfully mentored trainees in diverse fields such as nursing, medicine, health behavior, and epidemiology and the vast majority of trainees are scholars of color. This renewal will make it possible for the candidate to further develop her research program, and use her research program as a platform for her mentoring. She will leverage her ongoing R01, the Center for Health Equity Research, the Sheps Center for Health Services Research and NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, as a resource for her mentees. Bringing together the extensive career development resources of the Center for Health Equity Research, Sheps and NC Translational and Clinical Science Institute with the mentoring resources of the K24 gives the candidate a unique opportunity to develop exceptional mentoring to improve CVD outcomes. The proposed aims are to: (1) engage community members to define, map and programs. Finally, she will use the K24 to develop an innovative new research direction, examining the association between organizational networks in rural AA communities and sustainability of CVD interventions assess CVD risk reduction assets available in rural settings; (2) use mixed methods to understand the factors (communication, cooperation, and competition) that influence collaboration among organizations with CVD risk reduction programming; (3) conduct network analysis to understand how organizational networks change over time in rural communities among organizations conducting CVD risk reduction programming; and (4) examine the association between organizational networks and a) sustainability of CVD risk reduction interventions and b) CVD outcomes among participants in those interventions. The candidate will also continue a formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become successful leaders in CVD disparities research. Each mentee will have a focused career development plan that includes directed didactic and developmental activities and a mentored research project that will lead to first author publications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors are dramatic in rural and minority communities with limited access to quality healthcare. In this proposal, we will define assets that already exist in communities to reduce CVD risk and examine how organizational assets and networks evolve and are associated with sustainability of interventions to reduce population CVD risk. Combined with the mentoring component, to train new and early stage researchers to conduct high impact CVD prevention research, the proposed research is highly relevant to NHLBI's mission to enhance the health of patients so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.",Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities,9105424,K24HL105493,"['Accounting ', ' etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' Contraceptive Barrier Methods ', ' Barrier Methods ', ' Barrier Contraception ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Dairy Products ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Rural Community ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' salt intake ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' saturated fat ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Network Analysis ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community setting ', ' health equity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K24,2016,115892,0.2611619605479507
"Strong Hearts_Healthy Communities_A Rural Community CVD Prevention Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY There are notable cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities among people living in rural settings, particularly medically underserved rural areas. Complex factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage, social and cultural dynamics, geographic distances/barriers, and limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities contribute to the issue. Montana is one of the most rural states, with 76% of its 998,199 people living in rural or frontier (<6 people/square mile) areas. Montana's CVD rates have declined similarly to U.S. rates, but it remains the leading cause of death, and CVD risk factors such as obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes are increasing. The objective of Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities (SHHC) is to reduce rural CVD disparities through civic engagement and implementation of a community-based intervention in 10 underserved Montana towns. SHHC builds upon a long-standing collaboration with National Institute of Food and Agriculture cooperative extension educators, who will implement the project. For Specific Aim 1, we will inform intervention development through community audits, qualitative research, and forming Community Advisory Boards (CABs) with residents, health educators, local leadership, and other stakeholders in the 10 towns. We will gather knowledge about economic, social/cultural, built environment, food access, healthcare, and related topics. For Aim 1.1, we will incorporate audit, focus group, and key informant findings as well as input from CABs to inform the SHHC curriculum, facilitate community engagement, and build capacity. For Aim 2, overweight and obese midlife and older women will participate in a 24-week community-randomized study. Subjects will attend twice weekly classes focused on exercise, nutrition, and CVD prevention education and skills. Each group will also choose a CVD-related community health issue of relevance to their town and help facilitate community events and activities, e.g. healthy foods, physical activity opportunitie, wellness services. We will evaluate anthropometric (e.g. BMI), physiologic (e.g. lipids, blood pressure), behavioral (e.g. 7-day accelerometry), and psychosocial (e.g. quality of life) outcomes. For Aim 2.1, we will evaluate attitudinal and behavioral changes among members of the SHHC participants' ""social network"". Aim 2 intervention subjects will be asked to identify 1-5 of their closest friends and/or family members, who will be invited to complete baseline and follow-up questionnaires. The novel integration of community programming and civic engagement has the potential to effect clinically meaningful improvements in participants, families, and communities; this approach will help sustain reduced CVD rates by linking behavior change and community factors. Further, SHHC will provide a feasible model for other underserved rural communities to improve health and quality of life and reduce CVD risk among residents. In addition, we will convene a SHHC National Advisory Board, to provide expert guidance throughout the project, and to collaborate on a future large-scale effectiveness trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals living in rural settings, particularly medically underserved areas, are at increased risk for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and other disparities affected by socioeconomic disadvantage, topographic and geographical distances/barriers, social and cultural issues, and limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities. The proposed community-based randomized controlled trial will utilize a participatory approach to engage local residents, health educators, and community leaders to inform the development of an evidence-based CVD-prevention program that will be implemented by NIFA extension educators in 10 medically underserved rural communities. The integration of community-informed program development as well as civic engagement and capacity building activities focused on local resources (e.g. healthy foods, physical activity opportunities, preventive healthcare services) will provide an innovative model for improved rural community health promotion, health behavior maintenance, and community environment factors as well as the potential for broad public health impact in other underserved rural areas through national dissemination.",Strong Hearts_Healthy Communities_A Rural Community CVD Prevention Program,9022512,R01HL120702,"['Affect ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviors ', ' Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice ', ' Leadership ', ' Lipids ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Montana ', ' nutrition ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' QOL ', ' Quality of life ', ' Questionnaires ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' smoking cessation ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' Family member ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Rural Community ', ' Uninsured ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Staging ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' Over weight ', ' Overweight ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' healthcare economics ', ' health care economics ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Health Educators ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' US State ', ' Geographic state ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Randomized ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' Prevention education ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' underserved rural area ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' Community Integration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' older women ', ' obesity risk ', ' medically underserved ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' built environment ', ' community building ', ' curriculum development ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' exercise program ', ' fitness program ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' ']",NHLBI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,595905,0.07322498492984861
"Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of women in the United States and African-American women have strikingly high rates of CVD-related death and disability compared to White women. These stark racial disparities have persisted for decades, have increased among young to middle-aged women, and are not explained by traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic status (SES). Racism-related stressors have been proposed as one potential pathway through which ""race"" impacts cardiovascular health; but most studies have focused on interpersonal experiences of racism, which may actually underestimate the impact of racism- related psychosocial stress on CVD. The proposed research is designed to determine whether a novel, racism-related stressor -""expectations of racism"" --is a risk factor for early CVD in African-American women. We have compelling cross-sectional preliminary data demonstrating that among African-American women, ""expectations"" of racism are associated with measurable indices of CVD; independent of actual experiences of racism, and other forms of psychosocial stress. This application builds upon this prior work by using innovative methodologies from public health and psychology to determine whether, in what contexts, and how this unique psychosocial stressor contributes to CVD risk in African-American women over time. We will examine expectations of racism and increases in early CVD risk over a 2-year follow up in a community sample of 400 healthy African-American women aged 30-45. Early CVD risk will be assessed via changes in carotid intima media thickening (CIMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, and 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), a measure of autonomic physiologic arousal and a potential mechanism linking expectations of racism to IMT. Additionally, because research suggests that expectations of racism are largely influenced by context, we will examine whether associations are more pronounced among women with high (vs. low) levels of exposure to interracial contact (assessed via novel measures of ""activity spaces"" that can determine the average percentage of time spent in integrated vs. segregated environments). Finally, in order to determine how high levels of expected racism contribute to physiological responses and psychological distress on a day-to-day basis, we will conduct a daily diary study in a subsample of women, to examine daily ABP reactivity to interpersonal stressors, as well as day-to-day affect. Secondary aims will examine additional psychosocial stressors and cultural resources as potential moderators, and rumination, negative affect and social disconnectedness as potential mediators. Findings from this study will ultimately be used to develop psychosocial interventions to help African-American women at risk for CVD cope with the threat of expected racism.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether a novel, racism-related psychosocial stressor is a unique risk factor for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) in young to middle-aged African-American women. Recent research suggests that African-American women aged 35-44 have rates of CVD that are higher than those of African-American men, White men, and White women. These disparities are not due to obesity or other traditional CVD risk factors and are likely to increase over time. Identifying the determinants of early CVD in African-American women will be key to designing preventive interventions for this understudied, at risk group, and ultimately reducing their excess burden of disease.            ",Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women,9010143,R01HL130471,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' electronic device ', ' Electronics ', ' Environment ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methodology ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Moods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' Friendships ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Health Psychology ', ' Exposure to ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Depressed mood ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intima media ', ' coping ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical risk ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' racial identity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,778295,0.22552220101449566
"Encouraging Mail Order Pharmacy Use to Improve Outcomes and Reduce Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adherence to effective cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor medications is associated with improved CVD risk factor control, fewer hospitalizations, and lower mortality in patients with diabetes. However, many patients are poorly adherent to medications, and there are persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in medication adherence. Traditional clinical trials of interventions to improve medication adherence are often resource-intensive, and focus exclusively on patient-level barriers to behavior change. Unsurprisingly, these trials have not led to sustainable, cost-effective approaches to improve adherence. Health system-level medication adherence interventions that can be implemented, ""scaled up,"" and sustained across a wide range of health care delivery settings are urgently needed. Delivering efficacious prescription drugs through existing mail order pharmacies can be considered a system-level approach to enhancing access to medications. Previous research using observational data has shown that mail order pharmacy use is associated with improved adherence to CVD risk factor medications, and with improved CVD risk factor control. Despite this evidence, and although mail order pharmacy use is potentially cost-saving to both patients and health plans, fewer than 25% of patients with diabetes use the mail order pharmacy to obtain their diabetes medications. Mail order pharmacy use is even lower among non- whites and patients with lower socioeconomic status. We propose a randomized encouragement trial to encourage use of existing mail order pharmacy services among diabetes patients with poor adherence to CVD risk factor medications and who only use retail pharmacies in 3 health care systems: Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Harvard Pilgrim, and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii. These combined systems include approximately 300,000 patients with diabetes with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Patients with no history of mail order pharmacy use will be randomized into 3 arms: 1) a standardized intervention to encourage mail order use and provide easily accessible information on how to access the service; 2) a personalized intervention that includes components of the standardized intervention as well as additional information tailored to patient-specific characteristics such as prescription regimens and individualized potential savings by switching to the mail order pharmacy; and 3) usual care. In addition to examining the impact of the intervention on medication adherence and CVD risk factor control, we will examine factors affecting the sustainability and dissemination of the intervention, assess the intervention's impact on utilization and health care costs, and determine whether the intervention's impact differs across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups.

The proposed application seeks to establish an innovative public-private partnership between the currently funded New York University (NYU) Prevention Research Center (PRC) and the City University of New York School of Public Health (CUNY SPH) that leverages existing collaborations in public health practice and research collaborations between partner institutions and their local, state, and federal public health agencies. The proposed NYU- CUNY PRC focuses on improving the health of communities at risk for CVD disparities through the adoption, dissemination and implementation of integrated, evidence-based community and clinical strategies to advance goals of the Million Hearts Initiative. Our focus will be on Asian and Hispanic American communities, which share commonalities related to immigration, migration, acculturation, language access, and cultural diversity. For the Core Research Project, the NYU-CUNY PRC is partnering with a large health plan to test integrated combinations of community health worker (CHW) models and electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical interventions for CVD prevention in South Asian communities, with an aim.to advance implementation of the Million Hearts Initiative. PRC research activities align with CDC strategic priorities of disseminating health systems interventions to improve the effective delivery and use of clinical and preventive services and improve community-clinical linkages. In addition, the PRC efforts will support efforts to improve physical activity and nutrition, a core component of the Million Hearts Initiatie and a CDC-defined winnable battle. The PRC also aligns with EHR intervention efforts by local and state public health agencies and incorporates a population health surveillance perspective. PRC activities will contribute to understanding of how best to reduce CVD health disparities in Asian and Latino American communities through research, community engagement and training involving the full range of public health practitioners, community partners, academic researchers, and students of public health and medicine.

"Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the United States and disables 10 million Americans each year. However, CVD risk in the US is higher for African Americans (AAs) relative to European Americans (EAs). In addition to R/E differences in CVD risk, there is extensive data demonstrating that, relative to EAs, AAs have higher rates of poverty and a corresponding increase in exposure to environmental toxicants, including lead (Pb), both in their blood and in their bones. Moreover, studies suggest a positive association between Pb and blood pressure, left ventricular hypertrophy, and CVD mortality. The current proposal addresses the question of whether R/E differences in CVD are partially a consequence of corresponding differences in exposure to Pb from the environment. Furthermore, this proposal considers whether these effects might be amplified by R/E differences in psychosocial background, including social control motives, background stress, and racial discrimination. Specifically, our proposal focuses on whether R/E differences in Pb exposure might produce differing rates of CVD risk through underlying alterations in cardiovascular responses to acute psychological stress, a mechanism whereby the psychosocial environment can affect CVD risk. In recent research (Gump, et al., 2011), increasing blood Pb was associated with alterations in cardiac autonomic regulation reflecting ""co-inhibition"" of both sympathetic and parasympathetic activity that is typically associated with greater vascular resistance, a cardiovascular pattern we had already observed in children with heightened early childhood blood Pb (Gump, et al., 2005). This vascular response to stress has also been shown to be associated with greater left ventricular mass, a significant predictor of cardiovascular morbidity. Interestingly, a number of studies have noted that AAs respond to psychological stress with a vascular pattern relative to EAs typical cardiac response and are more likely than EAs to develop left ventricular hypertrophy at similar levels of blood pressure, and have greater arterial stiffness as reflected by faster pulse wave velocity. In sum, there is evidence that: 1) AAs (relative to EAs) have higher levels of blood Pb, 2) AAs (relative to EAs) typically respond to stress with a more vascular pattern, as well as greater arterial stiffness and left ventricular mass, and 3) increasing Pb is associated with a heightened vascular response to acute stress. This accumulated evidence provides strong support for testing the hypothesis that R/E differences in Pb exposure might account for R/E differences in cardiovascular patterns of response to acute stress and R/E differences in left ventricular mass and arterial stiffness. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: African Americans are at greater risk for cardiovascular disease relative to European Americans, although the reason for this racial health disparity is not understood. Taken together, the racial disparity in lead (Pb) exposure and additional evidence for effects of Pb on cardiovascular functioning suggest a possible mechanism for differences in disease prevalence. As a method to understand the early antecedents of these racial disparities, children represent an important population in which to consider effects of Pb exposure on subclinical CVD outcomes.","Environmental Toxicants, Race, and Cardiovascular Disease Risk in Children",8986169,R01ES023252,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' bone ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Cause of Death ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child ', ' coronary arterial disease ', ' atherosclerotic coronary disease ', ' Coronary Atherosclerosis ', ' Coronary Artery Disorder ', ' Coronary Artery Disease ', ' Coronary Arteriosclerosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Health ', ' chronic heart failure ', ' Heart Decompensation ', ' Cardiac Failure Congestive ', ' Congestive Heart Failure ', ' hemodynamics ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' K element ', ' Potassium ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Social Controls ', ' Na element ', ' Sodium ', ' Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Testing ', ' environmental toxicant ', ' Toxic Environmental Agents ', ' Environmental Toxin ', ' Toxic Environmental Substances ', ' United States ', ' Vascular resistance ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Left Ventricular Hypertrophy ', ' Left ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' race-based discrimination ', ' race discrimination ', ' racial discrimination ', ' young adulthood ', ' adult youth ', ' young adult ', ' European ', ' Measurement ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Pulse ', ' Physiologic pulse ', ' Pattern ', ' LV Mass ', ' Left Ventricular Mass ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' cohesion ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' early childhood ', ' artery stiffness ', ' artery stiffening ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' ethnic difference ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' Trace metal ', ' social ', ' acute stress ', ' Regulation ', ' blood Pb ', ' blood lead ', ' Modeling ', ' response ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Thickness ', ' Thick ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Intake ', ' Sum ', ' Ventricular ', ' Cardiac ', ' lead exposed ', ' exposure to lead ', ' exposure to Pb ', ' exposed to lead ', ' Pb2+ exposed ', ' Pb2+ Exposure ', ' Pb exposure ', ' Pb exposed ', ' Exposure to Pb2+ ', ' lead exposure ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' number theory ', ' diophantine approximation ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' Lead levels ', ' level of lead ', ' lead level ', ' Pb levels ', ' racial health disparity ', ' racial disparities in health ', ' ']",NIEHS,SYRACUSE UNIVERSITY,R01,2016,415765,0.10688881752909758

"Racial/Ethnic Differences in 25(OH)D and PTH Levels and CVD among Women DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The recent report on vitamin D from the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted the need for further research to clarify the optimal levels of vitamin D for nonskeletal outcomes, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to assess whether the relationships vary by race/ethnicity. Observational studies have suggested interrelationships between low 25-hydroxy vitamin D [25(OH) D], high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, and increased risk of CVD. Vitamin D binding protein (VDBP), the major vitamin D carrier protein, plays a key role in regulating vitamin D bioavailability and could potentially be a predictor of CVD events or an effect modifier of the relation between 25(OH) D and/or PTH and CVD. Vitamin D metabolites are mostly bound to VDBP and albumin, and it is possible that the free, unbound portions of vitamin D metabolites are the most biologically active and therefore most relevant for CVD risk prediction. However, no studies have specifically assessed the association between free or bioavailable 25(OH) D levels and CVD. Available evidence on total 25(OH)D levels and cardiovascular health also remains inconsistent and inconclusive, and few studies have had sufficient size and racial/ethnic diversity to examine these relationships across a broad range of circulating 25(OH)D levels. Clearly, there is a clinical and public health need to determine whether the relationships between vitamin D biomarkers and CVD vary by race/ethnicity and whether such differences can help to explain racial/ethnic disparities in CVD risk. The Women's Health Initiative Observational Study (WHI-OS), one of the largest and most racially/ethnically diverse cohorts of postmenopausal women with comprehensive information on CVD risk factors, intermediate phenotypes, and outcomes, offers a unique and cost-effective opportunity to answer important and timely questions about racial/ethnic differences in vitamin D biomarkers with regard to CVD risk. We propose to conduct a prospective case-cohort study in the WHI-OS to assess racial/ethnic differences in the associations of total and free 25(OH)D, VDBP, and PTH levels with major cardiovascular events (a composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI], nonfatal stroke, and CVD mortality). We will include all incident CVD cases in African-American (black) women (N=650) and a random sample of incident CVD cases in white women (N=1,500). Noncases will be drawn from a random subcohort of black (N=1,300) and white women (N=1,500) in the WHI-OS. In addition, we will examine whether total and free 25(OH)D, VDBP, and PTH levels correlate with a variety of intermediate CVD phenotypes, including directly measured anthropometric indices, blood pressure, lipids, and biomarkers of systemic inflammation, glycemic status, insulin resistance, insulin secretion, and renal function. In summary, the WHI-OS provides an exceptional opportunity to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the full spectrum of variation in levels of total and free 25(OH) D, VDBP, and PTH and to examine their potential independent and joint contributions to racial/ethnic disparities in CVD risk among postmenopausal women.

"Cardiovascular Disease among Asians and Pacific Islanders (CASPER) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, with total costs (including hypertension) of nearly $300 billion in 2008. The progression of CVD occurs over many years and is influenced by a series of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors that vary across populations. In the US, these factors are least well understood among Asians and Pacific Islanders. Asians are now the fastest-growing minority population in the United States, increasing 43% from 10.2 million to 14.7 million in the past decade.7 Similarly, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations have increased by more than 35% during this same time. While Asian populations in the U.S. are commonly thought to be healthier than other minority groups and non-Hispanic Whites, emerging research suggests that some Asian subgroups and Pacific Islanders might be at higher risk for CVD and associated poor outcomes. With such population growth, the health of these populations will have an increasing impact upon future US public health care needs and costs.  This compelling CVD knowledge gap about API populations has prompted the American Heart Association and the National Lung, Heart and Blood Institute to call for research that will improve the understanding of CVD among API subpopulations.10 To fill this important gap in knowledge about health disparities among API, we will measure CVD prevalence and outcomes among 9 well-defined API populations, and comprehensively assess the role of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors in explaining observed differences in CVD prevalence and outcomes among these groups. The multidisciplinary study team brings broad expertise in epidemiology, cardiovascular disease, and the role of social and psychological factors in health disparities. The study population will be drawn from the membership of two large, integrated health care systems located in different geographic regions with large clusters of Asian and Pacific Islander residents (Hawaii and northern California). The study will leverage the rich detail of more than a decade of clinical data contained within electronic health records (EHR) systems of both health plans. We will also collect patient reported data via a large-scale survey of 10,000 people. The study aims are to: 1. Describe differences in the prevalence of CVD among Asian, Pacific Islander, and mixed-race API subpopulations; 2. Determine whether demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors explain observed differences in CVD prevalence among these populations; and 3. Describe differences in CVD outcomes among these populations, including quality of life, and determine whether demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors explain observed differences.  Study results will provide important new evidence about underlying factors associated with CVD prevalence and outcomes among rapidly growing, diverse populations in the U.S. This information will provide strategic guidance for targeted interventions at multiple levels-provider, patient, and health system-to reduce CVD mortality and morbidity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of this study will provide important new information about the underlying causes of disparities in cardiovascular disease among a rapidly growing segment of the US population, Asians and Pacific Islanders, with findings potentially relevant to other minority populations.

"Health Disparities in Cardiovascular Disease Risk: From Genes to Neighborhoods DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are a major public health concern as the leading cause of death and as a major source of racial/ethnic health disparities. Because CVD is a multi-factorial disease, a true understanding of its etiology requires investigations of interactions among many genetic and environmental factors. Thus, the overall goal of this study is to advance our understanding of how multi-level factors (from genes to neighborhoods) synergistically affect CVD. The specific aims of the proposed research are to: 1) develop measures of neighborhood socioeconomic, built/physical, and social environments, 2) examine cross- sectional and longitudinal associations between genetic and neighborhood factors, and their interactions in relation to CVD risk factors, and 3) examine racial/ethnic differences in CVD risk factors and determine if these differences are explained by neighborhood-gene interactions. These aims will be achieved through the merging of data from the Research Program on Genes, Environment, and Health (RPGEH), with data derived from available sources on neighborhoods and the built environment. The RPGEH is one of the largest research resources in the U.S. designed to examine genetic and environmental determinants of common diseases. The candidate, Mahasin Mujahid, is an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at the University of California, Berkeley. The proposed NHLBI Mentored Career Development Award (K01) will provide Dr. Mujahid with the unique opportunity to augment her current expertise in general epidemiology, social epidemiology, and population health with new training in cardiovascular pathophysiology, genetic epidemiology, and statistical genetics. Moreover, Dr. Mujahid will receive the necessary support and training to work towards her long-term career goal of establishing an independent research program on the social epidemiology of cardiovascular disease with an emphasis on the underlying biological, genetic, and epigenetic pathways linking social factors to CVD.

"Using practice facilitation in primary care settings to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inadequate implementation of guidelines for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in primary care settings, particularly those serving low-income and minority populations, has contributed to persistent disparities in CVD-related morbidity and mortality. The objective of this proposal is to fill this current research-to-practic gap by testing the effectiveness of practice facilitation as a quality improvement strategy for implementing evidence-based guidelines for reducing CVD-related risk factors in primary care practices in New York City. The specific focus, of this proposal is to improve adherence to the ABCS - Aspirin (A) in high-risk individuals, Blood pressure control (B), Cholesterol management (C), and Smoking cessation (S). The long-term goal is to create a robust infrastructure to disseminate and implement Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) findings in primary care practices and improve practices' capacity to implement other PCOR findings in the future. Recent systematic reviews demonstrate that interventions with proven effectiveness in promoting the implementation of evidence-based research are tailored to the practice context and involve a multicomponent approach based on the Chronic Care Model (CCM). Most practices, however, lack the resources and expertise to coordinate a complex set of multilevel system changes without assistance. One implementation strategy that may effectively overcome these barriers is practice facilitation (PF). PF provides external expertise on practice redesign i accord with the CCM, and promotes a tailored approach to implementing guideline-concordant care to improve patient outcomes. We therefore propose to study the impact of PF on CVD-related outcomes by employing a stepped-wedge design in which 250 EHR-enabled small to medium primary care sites are enrolled into the control at the same time and then randomly assigned to cross over into the intervention condition at three month intervals with all sites eventually receiving the intervention. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients that have reached clinical goals for the ABCSs. The significance of this proposal and potential for large-scale dissemination of findings is enhanced by the unique partnership between NYUSOM, and the NYC Department of Health (NYCDOH) Primary Care Improvement Program (PCIP), with over 3000 small to medium sized primary care practices in their regional extension center and the Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS), one of the premiere not-for-profit primary care associations in the country. The proposal leverages PCIP and CHCANY's robust information technology infrastructure and efficiencies offered by their centralized data warehouses with capacity for data collection across diverse settings with different EHRs. The project is expected to provide critical new knowledge to facilitate the widespread implementation, dissemination and sustained utilization of evidence- based guidelines for prevention of CVD across the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of preventable death in the U.S. Guidelines for reducing risk factors for CVD, like hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking exist, but they are not well integrated into primary care practice. We will study strategies that promise to increase implementation and dissemination of guidelines for reducing the risk of CVD in primary care settings serving those populations most at risk for CVD-related mortality. The potential population health impact of fully implementing CVD- related practice guidelines, particularly in health centers serving disparate populations, is substantial.",Using practice facilitation in primary care settings to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease,9058471,R18HS023922,[''],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R18,2016,4977594,0.07138264603880551
"Reducing Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Rural Communities in NC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, however African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group. African Americans carry a significant burden of CVD risk factors that often co-occur; this burden is amplified in rural communities. CVD disparities at the intersection of race and geography are driven by individual risk behaviors and complicated by factors such as limited access to quality healthcare, socio-economic inequities, limited healthcare infrastructure and environmental barriers to behavior change. Interventions to ameliorate CVD burden in rural African American communities will require placing the individual in the context of the larger community and taking advantage of new technologies to support behavior change. However, how best to integrate mobile technology into existing evidenced based interventions (EBIs) is still an emerging field and social and physical environmental factors important in rural communities are rarely considered in existing EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by determining the feasibility and efficacy of adapting EBIs to consider the social and physical environment in important in rural African American communities and determining the acceptability of mobile technology in these communities to support behavior change. The proposed study is built on the strong foundation of Project GRACE's 8-year history of designing and testing interventions using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and individual and collaborative expertise in community-based CVD outreach, service and research. We have developed a phased CBPR study with a long-term goal to reduce rates of CVD in Eastern NC. The overall objective of this proposal is to assess feasibility of implementing an EBI, adapted to the needs and interests of a rural community in order to plan a large scale study. To that end our specific aims are to 1) expand and sustain a Project GRACE CVD coalition of community and academic stakeholders to develop successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities; 2) conduct a mixed-method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble, review and assess existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths and resources using a web-based survey of community, faith based, social service and healthcare organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk reduction EBIs and community members' perceptions of possible targets for intervention using focus group interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and facilitators) on acceptability of EBI acceptability; 3) adapt PREMIER, a multi-component EBI using intervention mapping; and 4) conduct a small-scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b) feasibility and adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings.

"CVD in American Indians  The Dakota Field Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 ¿15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes. The proposed study will take advantage of the Strong Heart Study data in American Indians to further our understanding of CVD and its risk factors, especially diabetes and obesity, which will lead to more effective prevention and therapy and reduce the burden of CVD morbidity and mortality.",CVD in American Indians  The Dakota Field Center,9065735,R01HL109315,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemic ', ' Extended Family ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Free Fatty Acids ', ' Nonesterified Fatty Acids ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Inflammation ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Liver ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Mental Health ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Social and Cultural Influences on Cardiovascular Risk in South Asians DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individual-level interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been met with limited success in many minority communities, partly because they do not address the sociocultural context in which individuals live and make food and physical activity choices. Widening our inquiry beyond the individual, to the larger social drivers can provide key insights into how social influences can be leveraged in interpersonal and community-level interventions to engage at-risk communities. Social networks influence health via many mechanisms: social influence and control; establishment of health beliefs and normative behaviors; feelings of shared identity and belonging; and provision of support. Social influences are key determinants of health; yet social network analysis has rarely been used to examine links between social networks and health in minorities.  The Mediators of Atherosclerosis in South Asians Living in American (MASALA) study is the first population-based cohort of South Asians (SAs) in the United States and is a substantial investment by the National Institutes of Health to understand the CVD disparities in the rapidly growing SA population. We propose to leverage that investment to investigate social network structures and sociocultural drivers of CVD risk factors in the MASALA cohort. Social relationships an especially important influence on SAs health behaviors because 90 percent are immigrants who believe kinship and family are paramount with emphasis on collectivism, social control, and maintenance of group identity. Our data from the MASALA study show that SAs have the highest prevalence of diabetes, an important CVD risk factor, and the lowest levels of physical activity compared to Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Chinese in the Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis. We also find that sociocultural influences may be partly driving these disparities and that individual-level prevention efforts may not be as effective in the tightly-knit, family-oriented SA community.  In the proposed ancillary project, the multidisciplinary research team will utilize quantitative social network methods to: 1) Uncover the unmeasured sociocultural drivers of variance in proximal CVD risk factors (body mass index, waist circumference, diet and physical activity behaviors); and qualitative methods to: 2) Investigate the meaning, significance, and function of SAs' social networks with respect to how they influence food and physical activity preferences and constraints. Qualitative interviews will provide greater context to the quantitative findings and elucidate mutable avenues for future intervention. Our team, with expertise in CVD prevention and nutritional epidemiology, sociocultural determinants of health, and social network analysis are well-poised to conduct this mixed methods research. The proposed research addresses critical gaps in CVD prevention research: understanding the influence of social networks on CVD risk and how these influences can be leveraged to improve the cardiovascular health of immigrant and minority communities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: It has been argued that social relationships are important to health and well-being. This study will investigate links between social networks and cardiovascular disease risk factors in South Asians, the second fastest growing ethnic group in the US and one with disparate rates of coronary heart disease.

"Childhood SES Factors: Impact on age-related cognitive and vascular health DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): U.S. blacks have a life expectancy that is significantly shorter than whites, with a larger difference between men than women. Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the single largest contributor to this disparity. Geographic disparities in health are similar to racial disparities in magnitude and effect. There is growing recognition that there are shared risk factors for CVD and cognitive impairment. Much of the research attempting to explain these racial and geographic disparities in health has focused on the participant's socioeconomic status (SES) or place of residence at the time of diagnosis or death. Increasing evidence, however, points to an important role of exposures during earlier lifecourse periods. The role of lifecourse exposures is difficult to study, however, because migration patterns obscure the links between geographic exposures and long- term health outcomes. The general aim of this study is to identify childhood and family SES factors (CH-SES) that shape disparities in vascular and cognitive health. Designed to determine the causes of racial and geographic differences in stroke incidence, mortality and cognitive decline, the REGARDS (REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke) study is a national population-based cohort study. REGARDS recruited 30,239 participants aged 45 or older, from 2003-2007, 45% men, 42% blacks. Data were collected using a combination of telephone interview, in-home physical exam, and self-administered questionnaire. Participants are currently being followed for CVD events and cognitive assessments. Our approach builds on the exceptional resources in REGARDS, in particular, the detailed residential history data. This study proposes to obtain data on CH-SES factors from three sources: 1) new data collected from the cohort via a mail-questionnaire; 2) linking existing REGARDS data on childhood residence to public Census data on family and community level SES conditions; and 3) linking existing REGARDS data on childhood residence to historic public school records on school quality at the county/school district level. These data on CH-SES will be linked to the detailed data on demographic and clinical characteristics of the cohort and examined as predictors of CVD and cognitive decline over follow-up. This research focuses on the contribution of social factors to geographic and racial disparities in cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment. Differences in social conditions across the lifecourse confound black-white and regional comparisons where childhood exposures probably influence associations between adult exposures and health outcomes. Understanding social contributors and ages where they are most influential are important to efforts to reduce health disparities across all racial and geographic groups.",Childhood SES Factors: Impact on age-related cognitive and vascular health,8852513,R01AG039588,"['Accounting ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Age ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' vascular ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Censuses ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Data Sources ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Family ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Influentials ', ' Telephone Interviews ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' Midwest US ', ' Midwest U.S. ', ' Midwest ', ' Midwestern United States ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Ohio ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Schools ', ' Societal Conditions ', ' Social Conditions ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' stroke ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' infantile ', ' infancy ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' residential site ', ' residence ', ' Individual ', ' Mortality Decline ', ' Exposure to ', ' Shapes ', ' Rivers ', ' cognitively impaired ', ' cognitive loss ', ' cognitive dysfunction ', ' Disturbance in cognition ', ' Cognitive function abnormal ', ' Cognitive decline ', ' Cognitive Impairment ', ' Cognitive Disturbance ', ' Impaired cognition ', ' Life ', ' Education Level ', ' Educational Background ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Source ', ' Pattern ', ' American ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' repository ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' geographic variation ', ' geographic difference ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Self-Administered ', ' Characteristics ', ' Coronary ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' age dependent ', ' age related ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' aged ', ' migration ', ' population based ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' population health ', ' cognitive testing ', ' cognitive assessment ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' school district ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R01,2016,540879,0.018410846677587453
"CV Wizard: Does a Prioritized, Point-of-Care Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Guideline-Based CVD Risk Factor Control in Safety Net Clinics? PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Substantial progress in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality would be achieved if evidence-based guidelines for CVD risk factor control were implemented consistently in primary care settings. Electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems that identify uncontrolled CVD risk factors and provide individualized care recommendations improved rates of guideline-concordant CVD care in large, integrated healthcare settings, but little is known about how effective such CDS may be in safety net community health centers (CHCs). CHCs' socioeconomically vulnerable patients have far worse CVD risk factor control and higher rates of major CVD events than the general population. Implementing CDS that leads to improved CVD risk factor control in CHCs could reduce national disparities in CVD outcomes, but CHCs rarely have the resources to develop sophisticated CDS, and very few currently have such systems for CVD care. The proposed study is designed to address this. We will randomize 60 CHCs with a shared EHR to immediate vs. delayed implementation of a sophisticated CDS system that provides point-of-care CVD care recommendations to the primary care provider and the patient, and has been proven highly successful in large, integrated care settings. Before implementing the CDS, we will ask CHC patients and providers about the particular patient needs and perspectives and clinic workflows likely to influence adoption and impact of the CDS in CHCs. This input will inform development of CHC care team training strategies, and adaptation of the patient-facing aspects of the CDS system. We will measure adoption of the CDS, and impact of its use over time on CVD risk scores and risk factor control (blood pressure, HbA1c, lipid levels; aspirin use; smoking; body mass index) in high-CVD risk CHC patients. We will also conduct a mixed methods process evaluation, to identify facilitators and barriers to use of the CDS, and to iteratively develop and test strategies for supporting its adoption and ongoing use in CHC workflows. We anticipate that this intervention could (a) improve CVD care among low-income CHC patients, (b) reduce CVD care disparities between CHC populations and national rates, and (c) facilitate greater CHC patient engagement in CVD treatment decision-making and prioritization. The proposed work directly responds to PAR 15-279 goals: it addresses gaps in guideline- based care in high-risk populations with targeted, innovative, multi-level strategies; considers setting-specific needs; and supports patient engagement. Our team's research experience and established partnerships with key healthcare system stakeholders increase the likelihood of project success. Results will yield EHR- agnostic CDS tools for use by any CHC with an implementation guide, build knowledge about how to minimize disparities in CVD care and outcomes using scalable CDS strategies, and help translate investments in informatics into clinical benefit for millions of high-risk, low-income Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project aims to reduce disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control and in rates of heart attacks and strokes among the low-income, racially / ethnically diverse Americans who receive primary care at safety net community health centers (CHCs). To achieve this important objective, we will adapt a successful clinical decision support (CDS) system currently used in CVD care at several large, integrated health care systems, to meet the patient needs and workflow processes of 60 CHCs. We will determine if use of this CDS improves CVD care, reduces disparities in CVD care and outcomes, and increases patient engagement in CVD treatment choices, in CHCs. Results of this randomized trial will help accelerate the translation of major investments in health informatics systems into substantial clinical benefits for large numbers of high-risk, low-income patients. Results will also provide a template for CVD care improvement that can be spread to other CHCs and extended to other clinical conditions.","CV Wizard: Does a Prioritized, Point-of-Care Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Guideline-Based CVD Risk Factor Control in Safety Net Clinics?",9293852,R01HL133793,"['Adoption ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Aspirin ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Community Developments ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk Management ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Smoking ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Integrated Delivery of Health Care ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' public health priorities ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' Patient risk ', ' support tools ', ' treatment choice ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' secondary analysis ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,773320,0.29304808153068373
"Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans ABSTRACT  This mixed-methods study utilizes a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets and qualitative data collection, to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion and Spirituality (R/S) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk factors. CVD risk factors, especially high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and depression, disproportionately affect African Americans in prevalence and/or severity, contributing to the higher associated mortality rate. Further, examining lifestyle choices (for example, diet and exercise) without appropriate sociocultural context does not provide practice-ready solutions on the manifestations, root causes and potential strategies for eliminating African American’s heightened CVD risks. As such, religion and spirituality (R/S) in the African American community have been acknowledged for their positive influence on social behaviors and emotional health, but have not been sufficiently examined for their role in attenuating or exacerbating physical health outcomes and in particular, the risks associated with CVD. Most research has compared the relationship between R/S and health outcomes by examining the specific denominations of their White participants, and blanketed Black participants’ religion to the “Black Church.” This approach disregards the diversity of beliefs, behaviors and ways of thinking found in the religious affiliation and denominations of African Americans. In a rare project that examined Black health outcomes in relation to specific religious affiliation/denomination, it was revealed that religious attendance had an inverse relationship based upon religious affiliation/denomination on black mortality rates not found in white participants. Thus, the standard of relying on religious affiliation and health studies based on White participants to determine expected outcomes for Black participants is likely to cause inaccuracies in research and interventions. The overarching goals of this research are to investigate the extent to which R/S is related to CVD risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression) through the use of robust secondary and primary data analysis. The two project Aims will use theoretically-, research- and data-driven evidence to bolster efforts to decrease CVD risk factors and improve health outcomes for African Americans. Aim 1 utilizes structural equational modeling to determine if R/S has direct and indirect effects on CVD risk factors through health behaviors. Aim 2 establishes how the relationships manifest through first-hand accounts of the attributes of specific denominations on the health outcomes of its congregants, thus allowing participants to explain how the relationships found in Aim 1 are manifested-or not, in their daily and R/S life. The purpose of this research project is to not only identify the direct and indirect relationships between CVD risk factors and R/S, but to provide in depth knowledge of core attitudes, beliefs, organizational structures, and/or practices that facilitate or attenuate positive health outcomes for African Americans. The precision and nuance of our project’s strategies will fill in significant gaps in research and practice that can be a catalyst for evidence-based interventions that examines of community and religious institutions to support positive health outcomes for African American. Project Narrative The proposed mixed-methods study will utilize a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets (Add Health, National Survey of American Life and the Jackson Heart Study) and qualitative primary data collection to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion/Spirituality (R/S) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors- including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression for African Americans, while considering religious affiliation/denomination. Our strategy will fill in significant gaps in public research and effective community and religious based interventions by providing specific and nuanced data that can help build accuracy and researcher- participant trust. Considering R/S and CVD risk factors, Aim 1 addresses what relationships are there using secondary data analysis and Aim 2 establishes how the findings in Aim 1 are manifested (or not) through interviews and focus groups with African American community members and religious leaders and congregants.","Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans",9470221,R01MD011606,"['Affect ', ' Age Factors ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Religion ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Socialization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Trust ', ' Protestant ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Equation ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' religious group ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Categories ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' informant ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community setting ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' Add Health ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,478421,0.21325356453542021
"REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke- Myocardial Infarction-3 Despite marked declines, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. To further decrease CHD, a better understanding of CHD risks and outcomes in the 21st century is needed in light of: 1) continued health disparities; 2) declining ST elevation myocardial infarctions (MI); 3) increasing sensitivity of troponin laboratory assays, increasing detection of very small and previously undetectable MI events; 4) wide use of statins and revascularization procedures, complicating population studies and risk prediction; 5) more people surviving their first MI; 6) increased emphasis on population health management and patient-centeredness. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort includes 30,239 community-dwelling white and black participants recruited in 2003-2007. In the previous 2 funding cycles, the REGARDS-MI ancillary study has produced >100 publications on racial disparities in CHD and identified novel CHD risk factors. The REGARDS parent and other ancillary studies have collected extensive phenotype, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, and patient-reported outcomes data, including linked Medicare data. A second in-home visit is nearing completion, providing patient-centered endpoints including quality of life up to 10 years following first MI. The availability of these novel data coupled with >10 years of follow-up for all participants offers a unique opportunity to study CHD among high-risk subpopulations, e.g., those with low socioeconomic status (SES), blacks, and older adults to identify strategies to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine the 10-year incidence of CHD and CVD (either CHD or stroke) and examine associations with traditional and emerging risk factors. CHD events will be adjudicated using the same rigorous methods used during the first 2 funding periods and combined with stroke events adjudicated through the parent REGARDS study. We will refine published CHD and CVD risk prediction models and assess emerging risk factors in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES) and by MI type (very small or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI). 2) Develop pragmatic strategies to identify high-risk subgroups that could be targeted for interventions to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. We will calculate population attributable risks and numbers of events potentially averted through population shifts in risk factor distributions. 3) Determine the rates of, and risk factors for, recurrent CHD events, heart failure (HF), and mortality after first adjudicated MI (including very small, or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI) or coronary revascularization procedure, overall, and in subgroups (e.g., type of CHD event, age, race, sex, and SES). 4) Using data from the 2nd in- home visit, describe patient-centered outcomes (functional status, depressive symptoms, stress, cognitive functioning, quality of life), HF, secondary prevention, and risk factor management up to 10 years after first adjudicated MI , overall and in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES). We will extend the REGARDS-MI study for another 4 years in order to expand the number of coronary heart disease events to over 1800 (currently 1000) and to extend follow-up to a full 10 years on all 30,239 black and white cohort members. This will permit our well-established team to conduct studies to inform population health management and the elimination of health disparities in the 21st century, both in the cohort overall, and among high-risk subgroups.",REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke- Myocardial Infarction-3,9333759,R01HL080477,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Calibration ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Ischemia ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity -

"Longitudinal Evaluation of Ovarian Aging and Cardiovascular Risk ABSTRACT Despite significant improvements in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the growing aging population suggests CVD will continue to pose a significant public health burden. Women are a special group where microvascular disease is more common and traditional risk factors may not fully identify risk. Women's reproductive history (e.g. menarcheal age, menstrual cycles, infertility, pregnancy, menopause) may pose unique risk and suggests an opportunity for new approaches. We propose a women-centered approach for early identification of women at risk that investigates the unique loss of reproductive function at an age long before other vital systems fail. Despite the importance of this process, little is known about the determinants or correlates of ovarian aging, or the health implications, especially in diverse populations. With reliable bio-markers of the remaining oocyte pool available, we have a unique opportunity to characterize the association between “ovarian age” and the health implications of accelerated oocyte loss. We hypothesize a risk independent of the well-known impact of early menopause and estrogen deficiency. Rather, we propose that common underlying cellular aging mechanisms, first evident in the ovary due to its sensitivity and earlier demise, make the ovary a window on underlying somatic health. Confirming an association between a decline in markers of ovarian age and CVD risk would allow a potentially high-risk population to be identified decades before traditional risk factors develop. The Ovarian Aging (OVA) cohort is the largest and most ethnically diverse, community-based cohort available that can be used to determine the race/ethnic and behavioral determinants of ovarian aging and its association with CVD risk in a young cycling population. To assess the relationship between markers of ovarian age (reflecting past exposures and genetic risk), the rate of ovarian aging (representing current exposures) and CVD risk, we propose to: 1. Determine whether markers of ovarian age/aging are associated with increased CVD risk by testing if ovarian age/aging is independently associated with increased CVD risk, as measured by peripheral endothelial function testing; 2. Determine whether ovarian aging may moderate or mediate established associations between race/ethnicity and/or socio/emotional health and CVD risk by examining whether observed race/ethnic disparities, or effects of socio/emotional health, on CVD risk, may vary by (moderation model) or be partially attributable to (mediation model) ovarian aging; and 3. Determine whether ovarian aging, CVD risk, and the temporal pattern of appearance correlate with markers of cellular aging: telomere length and mtDNA in peripheral leukocytes, oxidative stress (plasma F2α-isoprostanes), and indices of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1). Overall Impact: Our novel longitudinal approach to evaluating markers of ovarian and cellular aging as predictors of CVD could lead to a new way to identify women at earlier and/or increased CVD risk and be used to develop new risk-reduction strategies. NARRATIVE Despite significant improvements in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), women are less aware of risks for CVD and the disease is more lethal once diagnosed. The results of this study will provide detailed novel information regarding the potential correlation between ethnicity, behavioral risk factors and markers of cellular aging with ovarian age/aging and CVD risk. We hypothesize ovarian age/aging provides a window onto the general health of women - not via progressive deficiency of estrogen with menopause, but due to common underlying mechanisms first evident in young populations as lower ovarian reserve (follicle number) due to the sensitivity of the ovary.",Longitudinal Evaluation of Ovarian Aging and Cardiovascular Risk,9310311,R01AG053332,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Aging ', ' Awareness ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' mtDNA ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Infertility ', ' infertile ', ' fertility loss ', ' fertility cessation ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Menopause ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Premature Menopause ', ' early menopause ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Methods ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Oocytes ', ' Ovocytes ', ' Ovary ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' ICAM-1 ', ' CD54 Antigens ', ' Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' telomere ', ' Mediating ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ovarian ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Reproductive Issues ', ' Reproductive History Epidemiology ', ' Reproductive Factors ', ' Reproductive History ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' reproductive function ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Appearance ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' reproductive ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Isoprostanes ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Behavioral ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2017,1378860,0.13300553117534317
"Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of women in the United States and African-American women have strikingly high rates of CVD-related death and disability compared to White women. These stark racial disparities have persisted for decades, have increased among young to middle-aged women, and are not explained by traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic status (SES). Racism-related stressors have been proposed as one potential pathway through which ""race"" impacts cardiovascular health; but most studies have focused on interpersonal experiences of racism, which may actually underestimate the impact of racism- related psychosocial stress on CVD. The proposed research is designed to determine whether a novel, racism-related stressor -""expectations of racism"" --is a risk factor for early CVD in African-American women. We have compelling cross-sectional preliminary data demonstrating that among African-American women, ""expectations"" of racism are associated with measurable indices of CVD; independent of actual experiences of racism, and other forms of psychosocial stress. This application builds upon this prior work by using innovative methodologies from public health and psychology to determine whether, in what contexts, and how this unique psychosocial stressor contributes to CVD risk in African-American women over time. We will examine expectations of racism and increases in early CVD risk over a 2-year follow up in a community sample of 400 healthy African-American women aged 30-45. Early CVD risk will be assessed via changes in carotid intima media thickening (CIMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, and 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), a measure of autonomic physiologic arousal and a potential mechanism linking expectations of racism to IMT. Additionally, because research suggests that expectations of racism are largely influenced by context, we will examine whether associations are more pronounced among women with high (vs. low) levels of exposure to interracial contact (assessed via novel measures of ""activity spaces"" that can determine the average percentage of time spent in integrated vs. segregated environments). Finally, in order to determine how high levels of expected racism contribute to physiological responses and psychological distress on a day-to-day basis, we will conduct a daily diary study in a subsample of women, to examine daily ABP reactivity to interpersonal stressors, as well as day-to-day affect. Secondary aims will examine additional psychosocial stressors and cultural resources as potential moderators, and rumination, negative affect and social disconnectedness as potential mediators. Findings from this study will ultimately be used to develop psychosocial interventions to help African-American women at risk for CVD cope with the threat of expected racism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether a novel, racism-related psychosocial stressor is a unique risk factor for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) in young to middle-aged African-American women. Recent research suggests that African-American women aged 35-44 have rates of CVD that are higher than those of African-American men, White men, and White women. These disparities are not due to obesity or other traditional CVD risk factors and are likely to increase over time. Identifying the determinants of early CVD in African-American women will be key to designing preventive interventions for this understudied, at risk group, and ultimately reducing their excess burden of disease.",Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women,9206177,R01HL130471,"['Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Moods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Friendships ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Health Psychology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intima media ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical risk ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' racial identity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,763934,0.22552220101449566
"CVD in American Indians Biomarker lab and Arizona Field Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 �15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes. The proposed study will take advantage of the Strong Heart Study data in American Indians to further our understanding of CVD and its risk factors, especially diabetes and obesity, which will lead to more effective prevention and therapy and reduce the burden of CVD morbidity and mortality.",CVD in American Indians Biomarker lab and Arizona Field Center,9271999,R01HL109319,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Arizona ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemic ', ' Extended Family ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Free Fatty Acids ', ' Nonesterified Fatty Acids ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity -

"Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K24 renewal is for Dr. Corbie-Smith to establish a premier research infrastructure to provide exceptional training for the next generation of CVD researchers who address the health and healthcare of patients who bear a disproportionate burden of CVD morbidity and mortality. Dr. Corbie-Smith has made excellent use of the support provided in the first cycle of her K24. She has been highly productive, with an impressive trajectory of peer-reviewed publications in the emerging field of community engaged research. She has been successful in funding her work, obtaining a new R01 grant focused on dissemination of an evidence based intervention to reduce CVD risk in rural African American populations. She has mentored her first trainees to independence, and new trainees she has mentored with her K24 support have been successful in terms of publications and funding. She has successfully mentored trainees in diverse fields such as nursing, medicine, health behavior, and epidemiology and the vast majority of trainees are scholars of color. This renewal will make it possible for the candidate to further develop her research program, and use her research program as a platform for her mentoring. She will leverage her ongoing R01, the Center for Health Equity Research, the Sheps Center for Health Services Research and NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, as a resource for her mentees. Bringing together the extensive career development resources of the Center for Health Equity Research, Sheps and NC Translational and Clinical Science Institute with the mentoring resources of the K24 gives the candidate a unique opportunity to develop exceptional mentoring to improve CVD outcomes. The proposed aims are to: (1) engage community members to define, map and programs. Finally, she will use the K24 to develop an innovative new research direction, examining the association between organizational networks in rural AA communities and sustainability of CVD interventions assess CVD risk reduction assets available in rural settings; (2) use mixed methods to understand the factors (communication, cooperation, and competition) that influence collaboration among organizations with CVD risk reduction programming; (3) conduct network analysis to understand how organizational networks change over time in rural communities among organizations conducting CVD risk reduction programming; and (4) examine the association between organizational networks and a) sustainability of CVD risk reduction interventions and b) CVD outcomes among participants in those interventions. The candidate will also continue a formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become successful leaders in CVD disparities research. Each mentee will have a focused career development plan that includes directed didactic and developmental activities and a mentored research project that will lead to first author publications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors are dramatic in rural and minority communities with limited access to quality healthcare. In this proposal, we will define assets that already exist in communities to reduce CVD risk and examine how organizational assets and networks evolve and are associated with sustainability of interventions to reduce population CVD risk. Combined with the mentoring component, to train new and early stage researchers to conduct high impact CVD prevention research, the proposed research is highly relevant to NHLBI's mission to enhance the health of patients so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.",Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities,9237294,K24HL105493,"['etoh use ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Alcohol consumption ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Dairy Products ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Nurses ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Rural Community ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' salt intake ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' Services ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Development ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' health equity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' minority communities ', ' rural African American ', ' rural setting ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K24,2017,115738,0.2611619605479507
"Comparative Effectiveness Evaluation of a Diabetes Case Management Intervention in AI/AN Communities PROJECT SUMMARY  The long-term goal of this project is to address the striking disparities in diabetes and its complications that American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/ANs) face. To achieve this goal, effective strategies for diabetes management and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk reduction are urgently needed to decrease morbidity and mortality among AI/ANs and to improve their overall health and quality of life. Case management is an important approach to enhance traditional health care delivery for people at elevated risk of adverse outcomes. It holds great promise for alleviating the heavy diabetes and CVD burden among AI/ANs and other minority populations. However, how to effectively implement this intervention in the real-world settings of large and diverse communities remains unclear. The proposed study will comparatively evaluate the effectiveness of the Healthy Heart demonstration project of Special Diabetes Program for Indians (SDPI-HH), a cardiovascular risk reduction project using an intensive case management (ICM) approach. The efficacy of the ICM approach was already well established, thus, SDPI-HH was designed as a translational project without a control group. The effectiveness of the intervention has been evaluated as a pre- and post-test design which, albeit necessary and informative, provides only a partial assessment of the program's ability to manage diabetes and its complications. In this proposal, the SDPI-HH data will be combined with 2 targeted sources, the Indian Health Service (IHS) Diabetes Care and Outcomes Audit data and the data form the Look AHEAD trial, a randomized trial comparing the impacts of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI) and diabetes support education (DSE) on cardiovascular outcomes among individuals with diabetes. The specific aims of this project are: (1) Using IHS Audit data, to broaden the understanding of SDPI-HH effectiveness by comparing the trends of diabetes quality of care between HH and non-HH facilities from 1998 to 2013; (2) Using data from the Look AHEAD trial and employing a propensity score matching approach, to compare the effectiveness of SDPI ICM intervention with the Look AHEAD ILI and DSE approaches among patients with diabetes. Our proposed analytic strategy has the potential to reduce or eliminate potential biases present in one arm pre- and post-test design that are frequently the only option in community-based translational intervention initiatives. Not only will the resulting findings provide critical guidance as we seek to reduce CVD risks among AI/ANs with diabetes, they will also demonstrate ways in which publicly available public health surveillance and/or historical control data may assist in evaluating similar community-based interventions. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The aims of this project are to compare the effectiveness of a diabetes case management intervention implemented in a diverse set AI/AN communities with other interventions implemented in another public health program or a clinical trial setting targeting at similar outcome variables. The work proposed here promises to provide important knowledge about how to successfully implement diabetes case management intervention in the real-world settings of AI/AN communities in the future and to reduce the daunting disparities in diabetes and its complications such as cardiovascular disease that are borne by AI/ANs and other underserved populations eventually.",Comparative Effectiveness Evaluation of a Diabetes Case Management Intervention in AI/AN Communities,9314568,R21DK108187,"['Affect ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Colorado ', ' Communities ', ' meeting reports ', ' Congresses ', ' Control Groups ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Sources ', ' health services delivery ', ' Healthcare Delivery ', ' health care delivery ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Medical Records ', ' Morbidity -

"Childhood Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: An Intergenerational Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for more than one-third of all U.S. deaths and a major source of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities. Rising child and adolescent obesity rates threaten to erase the prior success of CVD prevention efforts. Without significant improvements in prevention, CVD prevalence is likely to increase by 10%, and related healthcare costs are likely to triple by 2030. Obesity and hypertension are major contributors to CVD risk and major sources of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities over the life course. Low-income African Americans are particularly vulnerable. Despite the availability of: 1) behavioral interventions addressing diet and physical activity as mainstays of obesity and CVD risk reduction, and 2) research evidence suggesting that family-level interventions may be important for eliminating child and adolescent CVD and obesity disparities; most adult CVD risk reduction interventions do not consider family- level effects. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an innovative and effective family-level intervention targeting adolescent family members of African-American (AA) adults at high-risk for CVD. This research will: 1) identify mechanisms by which an individual-level CVD risk reduction intervention can produce family-level effects, 2) yield an innovative family-level intervention that is likely to reduce adolescent CVD and obesity risk among high-risk AA youth, and 3) generate valuable pilot data for a future R01 proposal to inform refinement and evaluation of the family-level intervention developed via this proposal. This research is a critica step in developing effective and innovative family-level interventions with significant positive impacts on CVD and obesity disparities among high-risk adolescents. It also represents a critical next step in the scholarly development of the candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23). The candidate for this K23, Dr. Rachel J. Thornton, is a general pediatrician and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded patient-oriented researcher studying development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of multilevel interventions to eliminate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in child and adolescent CVD and obesity risk. During the award, Dr. Thornton will complete a rigorous program of training, including advanced coursework and practical research. Her proposed activities will occur within the rich training environment of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Johns Hopkins University including the Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Disparities and the Johns Hopkins Global Center on Childhood Obesity. Dr. Thornton will be supported by an exceptional mentoring team, including national and international experts in intervention research, health disparities, CVD, and childhood obesity. Through the proposed K23, Dr. Thornton will develop a solid foundation in CVD epidemiology and intervention research and will be well-equipped to successfully transition into an independent, highly skilled patient-oriented researcher.

"CVD in American Indians:  Imaging and Cardiovascular Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 �15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes. The proposed study will take advantage of the Strong Heart Study data in American Indians to further our understanding of CVD and its risk factors, especially diabetes and obesity, which will lead to more effective prevention and therapy and reduce the burden of CVD morbidity and mortality.",CVD in American Indians:  Imaging and Cardiovascular Center,9283590,R01HL109282,"['Abdominal ', ' Abdomen ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' senior citizen ', ' over 65 Elderly ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' Elderly ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' Alleles ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Architecture ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemic ', ' Extended Family ', ' Family ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Free Fatty Acids ', ' Nonesterified Fatty Acids ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity -

"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR GENOMIC DISSECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical Methods for Genomic Dissection of Cardiovascular Diseases Abstract This mentored career development grant application proposes a training program to integrate Dr. Sung's previous research in statistical genetics into cardiovascular disease (CVD). Her long-term career goal is to establish herself as an independent statistician in CVD genetics research so that she can more effectively participate in multi-disciplinary research programs with clinical and translational CVD researchers and be better equipped to develop and apply statistical methods to contribute more meaningfully to the field of CVD genetics. This will be achieved through building a strong foundation in the clinical and research aspects of CVD and enhancing her understanding of genomics and whole-genome sequence data. Dr. Sung's mentoring team consists of multi-disciplinary researchers with a strong research track record. Complex cardiometabolic traits including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes contribute to CVD, the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the industrialized world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to many exciting discoveries. However, most GWAS discoveries have not been translated to clinical care because the functional mechanisms underlying the genetic associations remain elusive and the roles played by the environment in modulating these associations remain poorly defined. The research objective of this K25 application is to decipher the genetic and environmental architecture of cardiometabolic traits by incorporating GxE interactions and regulatory annotation information. We hypothesize that joint analysis of the environment, regulatory variants and coding variants will enhance the discovery of putative genetic variants and the functional mechanisms underlying cardiometabolic traits. To evaluate this hypothesis, we aim to identify genetic variants involving GxE interactions and identify putative functional variants by incorporating ENCODE regulation information.

"Reducing Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Rural Communities in NC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, however African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group. African Americans carry a significant burden of CVD risk factors that often co-occur; this burden is amplified in rural communities. CVD disparities at the intersection of race and geography are driven by individual risk behaviors and complicated by factors such as limited access to quality healthcare, socio-economic inequities, limited healthcare infrastructure and environmental barriers to behavior change. Interventions to ameliorate CVD burden in rural African American communities will require placing the individual in the context of the larger community and taking advantage of new technologies to support behavior change. However, how best to integrate mobile technology into existing evidenced based interventions (EBIs) is still an emerging field and social and physical environmental factors important in rural communities are rarely considered in existing EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by determining the feasibility and efficacy of adapting EBIs to consider the social and physical environment in important in rural African American communities and determining the acceptability of mobile technology in these communities to support behavior change. The proposed study is built on the strong foundation of Project GRACE's 8-year history of designing and testing interventions using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and individual and collaborative expertise in community-based CVD outreach, service and research. We have developed a phased CBPR study with a long-term goal to reduce rates of CVD in Eastern NC. The overall objective of this proposal is to assess feasibility of implementing an EBI, adapted to the needs and interests of a rural community in order to plan a large scale study. To that end our specific aims are to 1) expand and sustain a Project GRACE CVD coalition of community and academic stakeholders to develop successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities; 2) conduct a mixed-method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble, review and assess existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths and resources using a web-based survey of community, faith based, social service and healthcare organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk reduction EBIs and community members' perceptions of possible targets for intervention using focus group interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and facilitators) on acceptability of EBI acceptability; 3) adapt PREMIER, a multi-component EBI using intervention mapping; and 4) conduct a small-scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b) feasibility and adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings. Project Narrative Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the US; however, African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group.

"Thrombosis genetics in African Americans ABSTRACT Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States, and disproportionate rates are seen in minority African American populations. Thrombosis and vascular inflammation are important contributors to atherosclerotic plaque rupture and vascular occlusion that underlie myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, as well as venous thromboembolic disease. The identification of novel biomarkers and their assessment in different ethnic populations can augment the information obtained from traditional CVD risk factors as well as illuminate underlying disease mechanisms and health disparities. While blood biomarkers have been shown to be critically important in the study of CVD, there is a deficit of studies of these measures in African American populations. Preliminary data suggest that thrombin generation, as quantified ex vivo by plasma measurement of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) is a novel approach to understanding the connection of both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways to thrombus formation in vivo. Whole genome sequence (WGS) data, including both coding and functional noncoding variants, are required to identify the full spectrum of contributions of rare variants to common diseases. WGS data are particularly important among non-European ancestry groups, where there is still relatively limited genomic information. Using stored baseline Jackson Heart Study (JHS) plasma samples from 3,500 African Americans, we propose to measure several emerging thrombosis and inflammation plasma biomarkers (endogenous thrombin potential, fibrinogen gamma', coagulation factors VIII and VIIa, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, soluble CD14, and soluble CD163) that are likely to reflect and/or account for increased thrombogenicity and therefore may contribute to higher rates of CVD in African Americans. We will assess the association of thrombosis biomarkers and biomarker-associated genetic variants with more complex subclinical and clinical CVD endpoints available in JHS and other African American cohorts, including REGARDS. By adding these key measures of thrombosis and inflammation to the JHS and REGARDS data sets, utilizing existing whole genome sequence data available through the NHLBI TOPMed project, and using innovative analytical and population genetic approaches, we will be able to greatly expand our knowledge of the role of thrombosis and inflammation in CVD health disparities. Project Narrative This project will measure thrombosis and inflammation biomarkers in approximately 4,500 African Americans from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Using available genome-wide sequence data through the NHLBI TOPMed project, we will investigate the relationship between genetic and environmental factors, thrombosis and inflammation biomarkers and cardiovascular disease in African Americans. Association findings will be validated in additional data sets of African Americans available through dbGaP and various GWAS consortia and collaborative networks.",Thrombosis genetics in African

"Cardiovascular Disease among Asians and Pacific Islanders (CASPER) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, with total costs (including hypertension) of nearly $300 billion in 2008. The progression of CVD occurs over many years and is influenced by a series of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors that vary across populations. In the US, these factors are least well understood among Asians and Pacific Islanders. Asians are now the fastest-growing minority population in the United States, increasing 43% from 10.2 million to 14.7 million in the past decade.7 Similarly, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations have increased by more than 35% during this same time. While Asian populations in the U.S. are commonly thought to be healthier than other minority groups and non-Hispanic Whites, emerging research suggests that some Asian subgroups and Pacific Islanders might be at higher risk for CVD and associated poor outcomes. With such population growth, the health of these populations will have an increasing impact upon future US public health care needs and costs.  This compelling CVD knowledge gap about API populations has prompted the American Heart Association and the National Lung, Heart and Blood Institute to call for research that will improve the understanding of CVD among API subpopulations.10 To fill this important gap in knowledge about health disparities among API, we will measure CVD prevalence and outcomes among 9 well-defined API populations, and comprehensively assess the role of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors in explaining observed differences in CVD prevalence and outcomes among these groups. The multidisciplinary study team brings broad expertise in epidemiology, cardiovascular disease, and the role of social and psychological factors in health disparities. The study population will be drawn from the membership of two large, integrated health care systems located in different geographic regions with large clusters of Asian and Pacific Islander residents (Hawaii and northern California). The study will leverage the rich detail of more than a decade of clinical data contained within electronic health records (EHR) systems of both health plans. We will also collect patient reported data via a large-scale survey of 10,000 people. The study aims are to: 1. Describe differences in the prevalence of CVD among Asian, Pacific Islander, and mixed-race API subpopulations; 2. Determine whether demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors explain observed differences in CVD prevalence among these populations; and 3. Describe differences in CVD outcomes among these populations, including quality of life, and determine whether demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors explain observed differences.  Study results will provide important new evidence about underlying factors associated with CVD prevalence and outcomes among rapidly growing, diverse populations in the U.S. This information will provide strategic guidance for targeted interventions at multiple levels-provider, patient, and health system-to reduce CVD mortality and morbidity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of this study will provide important new information about the underlying causes of disparities in cardiovascular disease among a rapidly growing segment of the US population, Asians and Pacific Islanders, with findings potentially relevant to other minority populations. Study results will have practical utility in the strategic design of interventions to improve primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease among Asian and Pacific Islander populations.",Cardiovascular Disease among Asians and Pacific Islanders (CASPER),9309053,R01HL126172,"['Cultural Assimilation ', ' Acculturation ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood ', ' California ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Systematics ', ' Classification ', ' data representation ', ' Data Reporting ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Planning ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Population Growth ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' peripheral blood vessel disorder ', ' Peripheral Vascular Disorder ', ' Peripheral Angiopathies ', ' Peripheral Vascular Diseases ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' experience ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Health system ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' Patient risk ', ' study population ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2017,1152927,0.17425038071217888
"Using practice facilitation in primary care settings to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Inadequate implementation of guidelines for prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in primary care settings, particularly those serving low-income and minority populations, has contributed to persistent disparities in CVD-related morbidity and mortality. The objective of this proposal is to fill this current research-to-practic gap by testing the effectiveness of practice facilitation as a quality improvement strategy for implementing evidence-based guidelines for reducing CVD-related risk factors in primary care practices in New York City. The specific focus, of this proposal is to improve adherence to the ABCS - Aspirin (A) in high-risk individuals, Blood pressure control (B), Cholesterol management (C), and Smoking cessation (S). The long-term goal is to create a robust infrastructure to disseminate and implement Patient Centered Outcomes Research (PCOR) findings in primary care practices and improve practices' capacity to implement other PCOR findings in the future. Recent systematic reviews demonstrate that interventions with proven effectiveness in promoting the implementation of evidence-based research are tailored to the practice context and involve a multicomponent approach based on the Chronic Care Model (CCM). Most practices, however, lack the resources and expertise to coordinate a complex set of multilevel system changes without assistance. One implementation strategy that may effectively overcome these barriers is practice facilitation (PF). PF provides external expertise on practice redesign i accord with the CCM, and promotes a tailored approach to implementing guideline-concordant care to improve patient outcomes. We therefore propose to study the impact of PF on CVD-related outcomes by employing a stepped-wedge design in which 250 EHR-enabled small to medium primary care sites are enrolled into the control at the same time and then randomly assigned to cross over into the intervention condition at three month intervals with all sites eventually receiving the intervention. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients that have reached clinical goals for the ABCSs. The significance of this proposal and potential for large-scale dissemination of findings is enhanced by the unique partnership between NYUSOM, and the NYC Department of Health (NYCDOH) Primary Care Improvement Program (PCIP), with over 3000 small to medium sized primary care practices in their regional extension center and the Community Health Care Association of New York State (CHCANYS), one of the premiere not-for-profit primary care associations in the country. The proposal leverages PCIP and CHCANY's robust information technology infrastructure and efficiencies offered by their centralized data warehouses with capacity for data collection across diverse settings with different EHRs. The project is expected to provide critical new knowledge to facilitate the widespread implementation, dissemination and sustained utilization of evidence- based guidelines for prevention of CVD across the U.S. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of preventable death in the U.S. Guidelines for reducing risk factors for CVD, like hypertension, hyperlipidemia and smoking exist, but they are not well integrated into primary care practice. We will study strategies that promise to increase implementation and dissemination of guidelines for reducing the risk of CVD in primary care settings serving those populations most at risk for CVD-related mortality. The potential population health impact of fully implementing CVD- related practice guidelines, particularly in health centers serving disparate populations, is substantial.",Using practice facilitation in primary care settings to reduce risk factors for cardiovascular disease,9266711,R18HS023922,[''],AHRQ,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R18,2017,4953410,0.07138264603880551
"Strong Hearts_Healthy Communities_A Rural Community CVD Prevention Program DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): PROJECT SUMMARY There are notable cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities among people living in rural settings, particularly medically underserved rural areas. Complex factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage, social and cultural dynamics, geographic distances/barriers, and limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities contribute to the issue. Montana is one of the most rural states, with 76% of its 998,199 people living in rural or frontier (<6 people/square mile) areas. Montana's CVD rates have declined similarly to U.S. rates, but it remains the leading cause of death, and CVD risk factors such as obesity, high cholesterol, hypertension, and diabetes are increasing. The objective of Strong Hearts, Healthy Communities (SHHC) is to reduce rural CVD disparities through civic engagement and implementation of a community-based intervention in 10 underserved Montana towns. SHHC builds upon a long-standing collaboration with National Institute of Food and Agriculture cooperative extension educators, who will implement the project. For Specific Aim 1, we will inform intervention development through community audits, qualitative research, and forming Community Advisory Boards (CABs) with residents, health educators, local leadership, and other stakeholders in the 10 towns. We will gather knowledge about economic, social/cultural, built environment, food access, healthcare, and related topics. For Aim 1.1, we will incorporate audit, focus group, and key informant findings as well as input from CABs to inform the SHHC curriculum, facilitate community engagement, and build capacity. For Aim 2, overweight and obese midlife and older women will participate in a 24-week community-randomized study. Subjects will attend twice weekly classes focused on exercise, nutrition, and CVD prevention education and skills. Each group will also choose a CVD-related community health issue of relevance to their town and help facilitate community events and activities, e.g. healthy foods, physical activity opportunitie, wellness services. We will evaluate anthropometric (e.g. BMI), physiologic (e.g. lipids, blood pressure), behavioral (e.g. 7-day accelerometry), and psychosocial (e.g. quality of life) outcomes. For Aim 2.1, we will evaluate attitudinal and behavioral changes among members of the SHHC participants' ""social network"". Aim 2 intervention subjects will be asked to identify 1-5 of their closest friends and/or family members, who will be invited to complete baseline and follow-up questionnaires. The novel integration of community programming and civic engagement has the potential to effect clinically meaningful improvements in participants, families, and communities; this approach will help sustain reduced CVD rates by linking behavior change and community factors. Further, SHHC will provide a feasible model for other underserved rural communities to improve health and quality of life and reduce CVD risk among residents. In addition, we will convene a SHHC National Advisory Board, to provide expert guidance throughout the project, and to collaborate on a future large-scale effectiveness trial. PROJECT NARRATIVE Individuals living in rural settings, particularly medically underserved areas, are at increased risk for obesity, hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and other disparities affected by socioeconomic disadvantage, topographic and geographical distances/barriers, social and cultural issues, and limited access to healthcare, healthy foods, and/or physical activity opportunities. The proposed community-based randomized controlled trial will utilize a participatory approach to engage local residents, health educators, and community leaders to inform the development of an evidence-based CVD-prevention program that will be implemented by NIFA extension educators in 10 medically underserved rural communities. The integration of community-informed program development as well as civic engagement and capacity building activities focused on local resources (e.g. healthy foods, physical activity opportunities, preventive healthcare services) will provide an innovative model for improved rural community health promotion, health behavior maintenance, and community environment factors as well as the potential for broad public health impact in other underserved rural areas through national dissemination.",Strong Hearts_Healthy Communities_A Rural Community CVD Prevention Program,9245732,R01HL120702,"['Affect ', ' agricultural ', ' Agriculture ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Family ', ' Feedback ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Heart ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Institutes ', ' Interview ', ' Leadership ', ' Lipids ', ' Maintenance ', ' Medically Underserved Area ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Montana ', ' nutrition ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Friends ', ' stop smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' cease smoking ', ' smoking cessation ', ' Family member ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Rural Community ', ' Uninsured ', ' Social Network ', ' base ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' Rural ', ' Collaborations ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' healthy food ', ' Health Food ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Country ', ' Overweight ', ' Over weight ', ' psychosocial ', ' behavior change ', ' Services ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention program ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Qualitative Research ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Process ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' Behavioral ', ' Prevention education ', ' effectiveness trial ', ' cost ', ' community intervention ', ' underserved rural area ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Food Access ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' frontier ', ' Community Integration ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' older women ', ' obesity risk ', ' clinical effect ', ' medically underserved ', ' therapy development ', ' treatment development ', ' intervention development ', ' develop therapy ', ' evidence base ', ' socioeconomic disadvantage ', ' socioeconomically underprivileged ', ' Socioeconomically disadvantaged ', ' built environment ', ' curriculum development ', ' Accelerometer ', ' activity tracker ', ' activity monitor ', ' accelerometry ', ' exercise program ', ' fitness program ', ' Preventive healthcare ', ' Preventive health care ', ' Preventative healthcare ', ' Preventative health care ', ' health care service ', ' healthcare service ', ' health care availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' access to health care ', ' Healthy Eating ', ' rural underserved ', ' rural setting ', ' ']",NHLBI,CORNELL UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,199981,0.07322498492984861
"Predicting and Preventing Hospital Readmission in Patients with Diabetes and CVD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to train Daniel J. Rubin, MD, MSc for a career as an independent investigator in the prediction and prevention of hospital readmission among patients with diabetes. Readmissions within 30 days of discharge (30d readmissions) are a high-priority quality measure and target for cost reduction. Patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are disproportionately over- represented in 30d readmissions, especially among racial minorities and urban populations. Currently there is no validated method to identify diabetic patients admitted for CVD at the highest risk of 30d readmission, which is a critical prerequisite for targeting limited resources fr reducing readmission risk to those most in need. Furthermore, there are no proven interventions to reduce the risk of 30d readmission specifically among patients with diabetes. Dr. Rubin plans to address these gaps in knowledge with 2 aims, 1) validating and refining a Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Index (DERRI-CVD) for predicting 30d readmission risk in diabetic patients admitted for CVD, and 2) assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, multifactorial intervention designed to reduce 30d readmissions. The intervention adapts methods successfully used in other inpatient populations to diabetic patients hospitalized for CVD and will target those identified as high risk for readmission based on the DERRI-CVD. There are 2 Phases to the proposed research that address these aims: Phase 1 uses a new retrospective cohort of diabetic patients to validate and refine the DERRI-CVD for prediction of 30d readmission risk; Phase 2 involves a single-arm pilot trial to qualitatively assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. In order to successfully complete the proposed research and build on skills to achieve the overall goal of independence, Dr. Rubin will receive additional training through formal coursework and structured mentorship in the following: validating and refining predictive models, clinical trials, and principles of hospital quality improvement with a focus on readmission prediction and prevention. A distinguished group of senior investigators will serve as mentors and advisors to supervise Dr. Rubin's research and career development. The proposed research and training will help Dr. Rubin acquire skills, establish a body of work in this area and generate preliminary data to support a competitive R01 application to test the readmission risk reduction intervention in a randomized controlled trial. Such work is highly relevant in the current era of soaring health care costs and national health care reform. This proposal will enable Dr. Rubin to develop into a successful independent investigator while improving patient care and reducing readmission disparities through clinical research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge are a common and expensive problem. Patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, especially racial minorities and urban populations, are at particularly high risk of readmission. The proposed research will verify and improve the accuracy of a new tool to predict 30 day readmission risk and explore the feasibility and acceptability of patient education, adjustment of diabetes medications, and coordination of care by specialized nurses and community health workers during and after hospitalization to reduce 30 day readmissions among patients with diabetes hospitalized for cardiovascular disease.",Predicting and Preventing Hospital Readmission in Patients with Diabetes and CVD,9206498,K23DK102963,"['Boston ', ' Calibration ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lipids ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Nurses ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Medical center ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' economic cost ', ' Prevention ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' diabetes mellitus therapy ', ' diabetes therapy ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Information Technology ', ' glycemic control ', ' Population ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' diabetic patient ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' patient stratification ', ' stratified patient ', ' racial minority ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' ']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,K23,2017,192956,0.11575462276076222
"Comparative Assessment of Modifying Social Determinants to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Burden and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite advancements in prevention and treatments for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), fiscal constraints have driven federal and state policymakers to make difficult choices among competing policy decisions, often without evidence of effectiveness. A comparative effectiveness approach, or in the absence of experimental data, a comparative assessment approach that compares the estimated impacts of modifying exposures using observational data, can critically inform this priority-setting process. We and others have demonstrated that social determinants, upstream social factors such as income inequality and social capital/cohesion, are key predictors of disease including CVD. Yet important questions remain about which social determinants have the biggest impacts on CVD burden. Furthermore, we lack knowledge on which subpopulations and states are most affected. In spite of calls for comparative assessments/effectiveness of strategies to improve population health and prevent CVD, including from NIH, we still lack knowledge on the relative CVD burden and economic impacts associated with modifying such factors. Given this information, there are critical needs to accurately estimate the impacts of social determinants on CVD risks; to translate these estimates into policy- setting tools including impacts on CVD burden and costs; and to compare and contrast the costs and sizes of these impacts. Our overall objective is to provide the first comparative assessment evidence base to compare the CVD burden and economic impacts of modifying key social determinants in middle-aged and older Americans. We will accomplish our overall objective by pursuing the following specific aims using data from two large, nationally-representative samples of middle-aged and older adults, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths 1979 (NLSY) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), linked to social and economic measures by area of residence, and to Medicare claims and mortality databases: Aim #1) To determine which social determinants most strongly predict the risks of CVD incidence, mortality, and risk factors in middle-aged and older adults; Aim #2) To identify which subpopulations and geographic states are most vulnerable to the influences of social determinants on CVD burden and risk factors; and Aim #3) To determine which social determinants if modified are expected to yield the greatest reductions in CVD burden and its associated costs, both overall and by subpopulation. Regarding outcomes, our 3- year study is expected to identify the most promising social determinants on which to intervene to yield improvements in adult CVD burden. We will further establish how vulnerabilities to effects by geography and subpopulations may explain CVD disparities. By translating our estimates into population health and economic measures, we will directly respond to calls for comparative assessments and economic evaluations in CVD prevention research. Over the long term, we expect that our project will have high translational impact through guiding policymakers' evidence-based decisions to reduce CVD burden and inequities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Using two large, nationally representative samples, this study will provide the first comparative assessment evidence base to compare the CVD burden and economic impacts of modifying key social determinants in middle-aged and older Americans, hence directly responding to calls for comparative assessments and economic evaluations in CVD prevention research.

"Assessing the spatial heterogeneity in cardiovascular risk factors within and between blacks and whites PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My goal for the K01 award is to establish myself as an independent cardiovascular researcher with expertise in spatial statistics and disease mapping methods and an integral member of multidisciplinary research teams devoted to addressing cardiovascular disparities. Attaining these objectives will require focused didactic training and research guidance. Training The proposed career development and training plan consists of four distinct components: (1) career guidance and mentoring in methodological development and collaborative cardiovascular research through on-site and off-site mentoring by cardiovascular and social epidemiologists as well as spatial statisticians and GIS specialists; (2) structured coursework designed at establishing a basic foundation in cardiovascular and social epidemiology and advanced training in spatial methods in collaboration with geographic information systems; (3) leading innovative research utilizing the gained training; and (4) contributing in the exchange of ideas in statistics and epidemiology through conference and workshop attendance. These proposed training activities will allow me to become well grounded in cardiovascular epidemiology and cardiovascular disease disparities. These activities will also focus on deepening my understanding of CVD, enabling me to reasonably assess the spatial heterogeneity in its associated risk factors within and between blacks and whites. Research The proposed work will explore the extent to which environmental factors and cardiovascular health (CVH) vary over space at a small-area local scale and at a regional scale with a focus on spatial variation in CVH among blacks and whites and spatial variation in black-white disparities in CVH. By combining a novel health indicator, the CVH index, with novel spatial methods, this proposed work will better characterize the geographic heterogeneity in CVH for blacks and whites and for black-white disparities. Our novel statistical methods will be applied to two very rich and unique cohorts, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort and the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. The larger goal of this work is to define these differences in a way that provides evidence for targeted interventions to improve the built environment. Additionally, our findings will help support informed health policies to improve the cardiovascular health of both blacks and whites. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant public health problem. Finding ways to impact CVD is essential to better public health and to inform policy makers regarding the effect of various policies on cardiovascular risk. Our proposed methods will explore the impact of both individual and environmental risk factors for CVD, across two geographically, diverse NIH funded cohorts. The knowledge to be gained will focus on assessing the spatial heterogeneity of CVD risk factors within and between blacks and whites, and will inform the future development and implementation of policies.",Assessing the spatial heterogeneity in cardiovascular risk factors within and between blacks and whites,9371699,K01HL133515,"['adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardio-vascular ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cholesterol ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Supervision ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' executive coaching ', ' career counselor ', ' Vocational Counseling ', ' Occupational Guidance ', ' Career Guidance ', ' Career Counseling ', ' Vocational Guidance ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Specialist ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' good diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' member ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' geographic difference ', ' geographic variation ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' fasting plasma glucose ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' social disparities ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' black/white disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2017,159870,0.10834618311585985
"Rural Intervention for Caregivers' Heart Health (RICHH) ABSTRACT  In the patient-family caregiver dyad, emphasis traditionally has been on the patient or on helping the caregiver take care of the patient. This approach ignores the health of the caregiver. Family caregivers of patients with chronic disease are at uniquely high risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because of the environment they share with the patient, lack of time for personal care due to caregiving demands, and persistent psychological distress, caregivers of patients with chronic illness have substantially higher risk for CVD than non-caregivers. To reduce this risk, cardiovascular health interventions aimed at (1) CVD risk reduction (2) improving adherence to self-management of CVD risk reducing behaviors, and (3) preventing and managing depressive symptoms are required. Rural caregivers are particularly at risk for poor health. Most rural areas are characterized by marked health disparities, including elevated CVD risk, persistent poverty, and lack of social and healthcare resources. As such, innovative intervention programs are needed to improve cardiovascular health among rural caregivers while overcoming personal and environmental barriers to achieving this goal.  The Rural Intervention for Caregivers’ Heart Health (RICHH) program proposed in this study will address the important components of CVD risk reduction for rural caregivers of patients with chronic illness – most notably improved self-management of CVD risk reduction efforts, including prevention and management of depressive symptoms. We propose an innovative delivery modality designed to overcome environmental barriers in socioeconomically austere rural areas. The purpose of the proposed 2-group (RICHH vs control) randomized clinical trial is to examine short- and long-term effects of the RICHH intervention on CVD risk (i.e., lipid profile, body mass index, and blood pressure), self-care behaviors (i.e., diet quality, physical activity level, self-reported adherence to health behaviors), and depressive symptoms, compared to usual care control in rural caregivers of persons with chronic disease. A total of 280 caregivers of patients with chronic illness will be enrolled. Rural caregivers will be randomly assigned to either the RICHH intervention group or a usual care control group. We will stratify caregivers by gender in order to examine the moderating effect of gender on intervention outcomes, given the many differences between male and female caregivers. The RICHH intervention (6 interactive modules) will be delivered for 12 weekly sessions (30- to 45 minutes per session). In order to enhance maintenance of behaviors, we will also deliver 8 biweekly (every other week) booster sessions (20-30 minutes per sessions) for 2 months and then 6 monthly sessions. All sessions are delivered individually using a video-conferencing program on a multimedia digital device (i.e., mini iPad). Data on outcomes will be collected at baseline, 4 months and 12 months. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Rural caregivers of individuals with chronic illness are at uniquely high risk for development of heart disease. We propose to test the Rural Intervention for Caregivers’ Heart Health program, an innovative self- management program designed to lower heart disease and depression risk, and overcome environmental and personal barriers to self-management. This innovative intervention program will improve physical and psychological health for rural caregivers of chronically ill patients in rural Kentucky.",Rural Intervention for Caregivers' Heart Health

"Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of women in the United States and African-American women have strikingly high rates of CVD-related death and disability compared to White women. These stark racial disparities have persisted for decades, have increased among young to middle-aged women, and are not explained by traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic status (SES). Racism-related stressors have been proposed as one potential pathway through which ""race"" impacts cardiovascular health; but most studies have focused on interpersonal experiences of racism, which may actually underestimate the impact of racism- related psychosocial stress on CVD. The proposed research is designed to determine whether a novel, racism-related stressor -""expectations of racism"" --is a risk factor for early CVD in African-American women. We have compelling cross-sectional preliminary data demonstrating that among African-American women, ""expectations"" of racism are associated with measurable indices of CVD; independent of actual experiences of racism, and other forms of psychosocial stress. This application builds upon this prior work by using innovative methodologies from public health and psychology to determine whether, in what contexts, and how this unique psychosocial stressor contributes to CVD risk in African-American women over time. We will examine expectations of racism and increases in early CVD risk over a 2-year follow up in a community sample of 400 healthy African-American women aged 30-45. Early CVD risk will be assessed via changes in carotid intima media thickening (CIMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, and 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), a measure of autonomic physiologic arousal and a potential mechanism linking expectations of racism to IMT. Additionally, because research suggests that expectations of racism are largely influenced by context, we will examine whether associations are more pronounced among women with high (vs. low) levels of exposure to interracial contact (assessed via novel measures of ""activity spaces"" that can determine the average percentage of time spent in integrated vs. segregated environments). Finally, in order to determine how high levels of expected racism contribute to physiological responses and psychological distress on a day-to-day basis, we will conduct a daily diary study in a subsample of women, to examine daily ABP reactivity to interpersonal stressors, as well as day-to-day affect. Secondary aims will examine additional psychosocial stressors and cultural resources as potential moderators, and rumination, negative affect and social disconnectedness as potential mediators. Findings from this study will ultimately be used to develop psychosocial interventions to help African-American women at risk for CVD cope with the threat of expected racism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether a novel, racism-related psychosocial stressor is a unique risk factor for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) in young to middle-aged African-American women. Recent research suggests that African-American women aged 35-44 have rates of CVD that are higher than those of African-American men, White men, and White women. These disparities are not due to obesity or other traditional CVD risk factors and are likely to increase over time. Identifying the determinants of early CVD in African-American women will be key to designing preventive interventions for this understudied, at risk group, and ultimately reducing their excess burden of disease.",Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women,9467738,R01HL130471,"['Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical risk ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' racial identity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Moods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Friendships ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Health Psychology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intima media ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,46678,0.22552220101449566
"Reducing Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in Rural Communities in NC DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, however African American residents of rural areas in the south and southeast regions have the highest prevalence of CVD of any group. African Americans carry a significant burden of CVD risk factors that often co-occur; this burden is amplified in rural communities. CVD disparities at the intersection of race and geography are driven by individual risk behaviors and complicated by factors such as limited access to quality healthcare, socio-economic inequities, limited healthcare infrastructure and environmental barriers to behavior change. Interventions to ameliorate CVD burden in rural African American communities will require placing the individual in the context of the larger community and taking advantage of new technologies to support behavior change. However, how best to integrate mobile technology into existing evidenced based interventions (EBIs) is still an emerging field and social and physical environmental factors important in rural communities are rarely considered in existing EBIs. The proposed study will address this gap in the literature by determining the feasibility and efficacy of adapting EBIs to consider the social and physical environment in important in rural African American communities and determining the acceptability of mobile technology in these communities to support behavior change. The proposed study is built on the strong foundation of Project GRACE's 8-year history of designing and testing interventions using a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, and individual and collaborative expertise in community-based CVD outreach, service and research. We have developed a phased CBPR study with a long-term goal to reduce rates of CVD in Eastern NC. The overall objective of this proposal is to assess feasibility of implementing an EBI, adapted to the needs and interests of a rural community in order to plan a large scale study. To that end our specific aims are to 1) expand and sustain a Project GRACE CVD coalition of community and academic stakeholders to develop successful CVD risk prevention strategies in rural communities; 2) conduct a mixed-method community needs and assets assessment based on: a) assemble, review and assess existing sources of CVD data; b) identification of community strengths and resources using a web-based survey of community, faith based, social service and healthcare organizations; c) determine the acceptability of components of CVD risk reduction EBIs and community members' perceptions of possible targets for intervention using focus group interviews; d) determine specific family influences (barriers and facilitators) on acceptability of EBI acceptability; 3) adapt PREMIER, a multi-component EBI using intervention mapping; and 4) conduct a small-scale randomized control trial to assess a) efficacy; and, b) feasibility and adaption of implementing adapted PREMIER in rural settings.

"Patient perspectives on primary statin nonadherence Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the United States' leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs, but proven CVD risk reduction strategies are often not fully used. Medications such as HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as “statins,” can reduce CVD risks. However, up to 34% of patients never fill a newly prescribed statin (primary nonadherence), and consequently fail to reduce their CVD risk. Data about primary nonadherence are sparse. The limited data counterintuitively suggest higher rates of primary statin nonadherence in some populations at greater risk for CVD, such as blacks and Hispanics/ Latinos, but the reasons for these disparities are unknown. There is incomplete information about the interplay of patient, healthcare system and provider factors underlying primary nonadherence, and about the type and content of motivational strategies that might encourage primary statin adherence. It is crucial to accurately identify reasons for primary statin nonadherence order to ultimately help people lower their CVD risk. The long-term goal of this research agenda is to reduce CV risk by developing patient-targeted tailored interventions to promote medication adherence. This study will contribute a comprehensive understanding of the reasons that patients choose not to fill a newly prescribed statin, and patient preferences for solutions to overcome primary nonadherence. This cross-sectional study has two phases. In Phase 1, focus group and semi-structured interviews with middle-aged and older white, black, and English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latino patients will yield open-ended data exploring the range of reasons patients decide not to fill initial statin prescriptions (focusing on patient attitudes and beliefs), and solicit ideas for potential solutions to overcome these barriers. In Phase 2, we will develop and pilot-test a structured survey with a separate patient cohort (Aim 2). Cognitive interviews will be used to refine survey content and wording. Eligible study patients will be identified by querying standardized databases from a PCORnet (PCORI's National Clinical Research Network) Patient-Powered Research Network (Health eHeart) (Phase 1) and from a PCORnet Clinical Data Research Network (pScanner) and the University of California healthcare system (UC ReX) for Phases 1 and 2. The study's specific aims are to: 1) determine: a) patient attitudes, beliefs, and other factors associated with primary statin nonadherence and b) patient suggestions to overcome these barriers; and 2) develop and pilot-test English- and Spanish-language surveys to understand patient characteristics (e.g., demographics, health) related to: a) patient-reported reasons for primary statin nonadherence and b) preferred strategies to overcome primary statin nonadherence. We expect this study to provide critical preliminary information for the design and conduct of a future larger-scale survey, which will in turn inform the content of tailored patient-targeted interventions to reduce primary statin nonadherence, and ultimately reduce CVD risks. Relevance to Public Health Primary statin nonadherence (when patients fail to fill a newly prescribed statin medication) is a major obstacle to cardiovascular disease reduction in a significant fraction of the at-risk American public. Minorities and older patients are at greatest risk for cardiovascular disease, but some studies suggest that they also have higher rates of primary nonadherence.

The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes.

"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist. Project Narrative The overarching objective of this K01 career development award is to foster the transition of Dr. Azizi Seixas into an independent scientist in the area of sleep and cardiovascular disease and health disparities. The proposed study will investigate a novel mechanism underlying associations between insufficient sleep, obesity, and disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Findings from the study will be the basis of sleep and obesity interventions to reduce CVD risk, especially among diverse groups burdened by cardiovascular disease.",The effect of insufficient sleep

"Diet and metabolic risks: joint drivers of global epidemiologic transition  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background - Diet and its effects on metabolic risk factors are key drivers of the global epidemiologic transition. However, few studies have quantitatively assessed the complex interrelationships between dietary and metabolic risk factors, their combined effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes, their associations with macro-socioeconomic variables, and their influence on global health disparities in the context of the epidemiologic transition. Scientific Objectives- 1) To study the inter- relationship between individual dietary and metabolic risk factors in the context of overall diet, 2) To develop sophisticated and robust analytical methods for quantifying the combined effects of diet and metabolic risks on CVD and diabetes, 3) To examine how dietary and metabolic risk factors are influenced by macro- socioeconomic factors such as urbanization, income inequality, and education, and 4) to evaluate how diet, metabolic risk factors, and their relationship to macro-socioeconomic factors contribute to health disparities globally. Scientific and Public Health Impact - This work will provide key insights into the relationships between diet, metabolic risk, and macro-socioeconomic determinants of health and their combined impacts on CVD and diabetes within the context of the global epidemiologic transition. In addition, this research will provide essential new knowledge on how differences in risk factor levels affect global disparities in CVD/diabetes mortality by gender, ethnicity, and age. This research will directly inform data-driven, targeted health policies and interventions to stem the rising epidemic of CVD and diabetes, and will develop new interdisciplinary computational methodologies for assessing the health effects of multiple risk factors. Career Objectives - My primary career objective is to become an independent researcher in a tenure-track faculty position conducting rigorous empirical work focused on understanding the drivers of the global CVD epidemic and developing strategies to prevent CVD and diabetes worldwide. Career Impact - The K99 phase of this award will allow me to spend focused time on professional development activities in a mentored environment to learn particular skills, such as grant writing, public speaking, developing networks of collaborators, and managing a research group that are indispensible in becoming an independent investigator. In addition, it will allow me the opportunity to take advanced courses and learn high-level research methods and substantive knowledge in nutritional, cardiovascular, and social epidemiology and biostatistics from my mentor and senior colleagues. This training will allow me to broaden and deepen the scope of my research, especially since my doctoral degree was in a different field. The R00 phase of this award will launch my career as an independent scientist in a tenure-track position in a research-oriented university, allowing me to establish my research program with high-quality analyses and publications, while securing additional grant support. Overall, the K99/R00 will have an invaluable impact on my scientific/professional transition to independence. PROJECT NARRATIVE This work will provide key insights into the relationships between diet, metabolic risk, and macro- socioeconomic determinants of health and their combined impacts on CVD and diabetes within the context of the global epidemiologic transition.

"Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of women in the United States and African-American women have strikingly high rates of CVD-related death and disability compared to White women. These stark racial disparities have persisted for decades, have increased among young to middle-aged women, and are not explained by traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic status (SES). Racism-related stressors have been proposed as one potential pathway through which ""race"" impacts cardiovascular health; but most studies have focused on interpersonal experiences of racism, which may actually underestimate the impact of racism- related psychosocial stress on CVD. The proposed research is designed to determine whether a novel, racism-related stressor -""expectations of racism"" --is a risk factor for early CVD in African-American women. We have compelling cross-sectional preliminary data demonstrating that among African-American women, ""expectations"" of racism are associated with measurable indices of CVD; independent of actual experiences of racism, and other forms of psychosocial stress. This application builds upon this prior work by using innovative methodologies from public health and psychology to determine whether, in what contexts, and how this unique psychosocial stressor contributes to CVD risk in African-American women over time. We will examine expectations of racism and increases in early CVD risk over a 2-year follow up in a community sample of 400 healthy African-American women aged 30-45. Early CVD risk will be assessed via changes in carotid intima media thickening (CIMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, and 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), a measure of autonomic physiologic arousal and a potential mechanism linking expectations of racism to IMT. Additionally, because research suggests that expectations of racism are largely influenced by context, we will examine whether associations are more pronounced among women with high (vs. low) levels of exposure to interracial contact (assessed via novel measures of ""activity spaces"" that can determine the average percentage of time spent in integrated vs. segregated environments). Finally, in order to determine how high levels of expected racism contribute to physiological responses and psychological distress on a day-to-day basis, we will conduct a daily diary study in a subsample of women, to examine daily ABP reactivity to interpersonal stressors, as well as day-to-day affect. Secondary aims will examine additional psychosocial stressors and cultural resources as potential moderators, and rumination, negative affect and social disconnectedness as potential mediators. Findings from this study will ultimately be used to develop psychosocial interventions to help African-American women at risk for CVD cope with the threat of expected racism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether a novel, racism-related psychosocial stressor is a unique risk factor for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) in young to middle-aged African-American women. Recent research suggests that African-American women aged 35-44 have rates of CVD that are higher than those of African-American men, White men, and White women. These disparities are not due to obesity or other traditional CVD risk factors and are likely to increase over time. Identifying the determinants of early CVD in African-American women will be key to designing preventive interventions for this understudied, at risk group, and ultimately reducing their excess burden of disease.",Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women,9507308,R01HL130471,"['racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical risk ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' racial identity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Affect ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Moods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Friendships ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Health Psychology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intima media ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2017,106845,0.22552220101449566
"Assessing the spatial heterogeneity in cardiovascular risk factors within and between blacks and whites PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My goal for the K01 award is to establish myself as an independent cardiovascular researcher with expertise in spatial statistics and disease mapping methods and an integral member of multidisciplinary research teams devoted to addressing cardiovascular disparities. Attaining these objectives will require focused didactic training and research guidance. Training The proposed career development and training plan consists of four distinct components: (1) career guidance and mentoring in methodological development and collaborative cardiovascular research through on-site and off-site mentoring by cardiovascular and social epidemiologists as well as spatial statisticians and GIS specialists; (2) structured coursework designed at establishing a basic foundation in cardiovascular and social epidemiology and advanced training in spatial methods in collaboration with geographic information systems; (3) leading innovative research utilizing the gained training; and (4) contributing in the exchange of ideas in statistics and epidemiology through conference and workshop attendance. These proposed training activities will allow me to become well grounded in cardiovascular epidemiology and cardiovascular disease disparities. These activities will also focus on deepening my understanding of CVD, enabling me to reasonably assess the spatial heterogeneity in its associated risk factors within and between blacks and whites. Research The proposed work will explore the extent to which environmental factors and cardiovascular health (CVH) vary over space at a small-area local scale and at a regional scale with a focus on spatial variation in CVH among blacks and whites and spatial variation in black-white disparities in CVH. By combining a novel health indicator, the CVH index, with novel spatial methods, this proposed work will better characterize the geographic heterogeneity in CVH for blacks and whites and for black-white disparities. Our novel statistical methods will be applied to two very rich and unique cohorts, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort and the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. The larger goal of this work is to define these differences in a way that provides evidence for targeted interventions to improve the built environment. Additionally, our findings will help support informed health policies to improve the cardiovascular health of both blacks and whites. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant public health problem. Finding ways to impact CVD is essential to better public health and to inform policy makers regarding the effect of various policies on cardiovascular risk. Our proposed methods will explore the impact of both individual and environmental risk factors for CVD, across two geographically, diverse NIH funded cohorts. The knowledge to be gained will focus on assessing the spatial heterogeneity of CVD risk factors within and between blacks and whites, and will inform the future development and implementation of policies.",Assessing the spatial heterogeneity in cardiovascular risk factors within and between blacks and whites,9525378,K01HL133515,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Policy ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Supervision ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' United States ', ' Vocational Guidance ', ' executive coaching ', ' career counselor ', ' Vocational Counseling ', ' Occupational Guidance ', ' Career Guidance ', ' Career Counseling ', ' Work ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Specialist ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' good diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disease epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' member ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' fasting plasma glucose ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' social disparities ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' black/white disparity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2018,159870,0.10834618311585985
"Corazón de la Familia (Heart of the Family) ABSTRACT Hispanics have significantly higher rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk burden compared to non-Hispanic whites. Dramatic increases in rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in U.S. Hispanics are anticipated as the population ages and acculturation lends to engagement in unhealthy behaviors. Culturally appropriate lifestyle modification strategies are needed for effective risk reduction. Most lifestyle modification strategies have focused on individuals and sustained engagement in healthy behaviors is seldom achieved. Respectful of the Hispanic cultural value of familismo, prioritizing of the well-being of the family over that of the individual, we propose to conduct a family dyad-focused intervention that addresses family members as active participants in a lifestyle intervention for Hispanics with high risk for T2D or CVD. “Corazón de la Familia” (“Heart of the Family”) is a promotores’- (community health workers’) facilitated intervention that integrates evidence-based education and health behavior skills development with social support strategies through the involvement of family members. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial using a 2-group design and compare the short-term and long-term impact of the family dyad-focused active intervention to an individual-focused control condition on biological and behavioral T2D and CVD risk factors. Furthermore, we will determine how each active intervention dyad member’s engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors and level of support for their partner’s engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors affects their own and their partner’s outcomes. Guided by community-based participatory research principles, our community-academic partnership was formed in response to needs recognized by Hispanic residents of Kentucky for socioculturally tailored health promotion programs to reduce T2D and CVD risk. Hispanic community partners have been integrally involved in all phases of sociocultural tailoring and pilot testing the Corazón de la Familia intervention. The result of the work of our community-academic partnership is a family dyad-focused intervention that provides a unique approach to sustain engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to reduce T2D and CVD risk among at-risk Hispanics. Further, this community-based intervention has significant potential for broad implementation to successfully address T2D and CVD health disparities across U.S. Hispanic communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a community-based participatory research approach, this is a community-academic partnership initiative to reduce type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk in Hispanic community members with high risk for these diseases. The promotores (community health workers) facilitated intervention engages family dyads to support healthy lifestyle behaviors among dyad members, integrating skills-based risk reduction approaches with social support strategies.

"REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke- Myocardial Infarction-3 Despite marked declines, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. To further decrease CHD, a better understanding of CHD risks and outcomes in the 21st century is needed in light of: 1) continued health disparities; 2) declining ST elevation myocardial infarctions (MI); 3) increasing sensitivity of troponin laboratory assays, increasing detection of very small and previously undetectable MI events; 4) wide use of statins and revascularization procedures, complicating population studies and risk prediction; 5) more people surviving their first MI; 6) increased emphasis on population health management and patient-centeredness. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort includes 30,239 community-dwelling white and black participants recruited in 2003-2007. In the previous 2 funding cycles, the REGARDS-MI ancillary study has produced >100 publications on racial disparities in CHD and identified novel CHD risk factors. The REGARDS parent and other ancillary studies have collected extensive phenotype, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, and patient-reported outcomes data, including linked Medicare data. A second in-home visit is nearing completion, providing patient-centered endpoints including quality of life up to 10 years following first MI. The availability of these novel data coupled with >10 years of follow-up for all participants offers a unique opportunity to study CHD among high-risk subpopulations, e.g., those with low socioeconomic status (SES), blacks, and older adults to identify strategies to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine the 10-year incidence of CHD and CVD (either CHD or stroke) and examine associations with traditional and emerging risk factors. CHD events will be adjudicated using the same rigorous methods used during the first 2 funding periods and combined with stroke events adjudicated through the parent REGARDS study. We will refine published CHD and CVD risk prediction models and assess emerging risk factors in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES) and by MI type (very small or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI). 2) Develop pragmatic strategies to identify high-risk subgroups that could be targeted for interventions to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. We will calculate population attributable risks and numbers of events potentially averted through population shifts in risk factor distributions. 3) Determine the rates of, and risk factors for, recurrent CHD events, heart failure (HF), and mortality after first adjudicated MI (including very small, or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI) or coronary revascularization procedure, overall, and in subgroups (e.g., type of CHD event, age, race, sex, and SES). 4) Using data from the 2nd in- home visit, describe patient-centered outcomes (functional status, depressive symptoms, stress, cognitive functioning, quality of life), HF, secondary prevention, and risk factor management up to 10 years after first adjudicated MI , overall and in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES). We will extend the REGARDS-MI study for another 4 years in order to expand the number of coronary heart disease events to over 1800 (currently 1000) and to extend follow-up to a full 10 years on all 30,239 black and white cohort members. This will permit our well-established team to conduct studies to inform population health management and the elimination of health disparities in the 21st century, both in the cohort overall, and among high-risk subgroups.",REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke- Myocardial Infarction-3,9437820,R01HL080477,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Ischemia ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity -

"Impact of multilevel risk and resilience factors on cardiovascular health in racially/ethnically diverse men and women Project Summary/Abstract In the US, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death. African Americans (AAs), low- socioeconomic position (SEP) groups, southerners, and Hispanics are impacted disproportionately by CVD. In addition, compared to women, men have earlier onset of CVD and have had higher death rates attributable to CVD. These sex differences and racial/ethnic and SEP disparities are setbacks to achieving national health equity and CVD reduction goals. To reduce differences and disparities in CVD, it is critical to improve cardiovascular (CV) health. A 2015 AHA statement indicated that “the most significant opportunity” to improve CV health and reduce CVD lies in addressing the social determinants of health. Such determinants include psychosocial risks (e.g., racism, discrimination, and low SEP) operating at multiple levels. Emerging research indicates that resilience resources at the individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood levels may protect CV health in the face of multilevel psychosocial risks via indirect effects such as more positive health behaviors and buffering effects of psychosocial risks on physiological functioning. Resilience resources are defined as positive adaptation and display of positive behaviors/outcomes despite adversity. Compared to multilevel psychosocial risks, multilevel resilience resources represent novel and potentially more malleable intervention targets. Despite growing evidence supporting the protective effects of resilience resources on CV outcomes, critical research gaps remain. For example, the majority of resilience research has not been conducted with disparity populations, populations free of CVD, included multilevel psychosocial risks, or tested for differences between sex and racial/ethnic groups. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to examine if multilevel resilience resources are associated with CV outcomes and if multilevel psychosocial risks moderate these relationships. Specifically, longitudinal data on racially/ethnically diverse men and women enrolled in three CV health cohorts (i.e., JHS, MESA, MASALA) will be harmonized to create an integrated dataset. Using the integrated data we aim to: (a) determine whether the most reliable and valid measures of multilevel risk and multilevel resilience resources demonstrate measurement invariance across sex and diverse racial/ethnic groups; (b) determine if multilevel resilience resources are associated with ideal CV health over time and if multilevel psychosocial risks moderate observed relationships; (c) determine if multilevel resilience resources are prospectively associated with incident CVD events over time and if multilevel psychosocial risks moderate observed relationships; and (d) quantify the degree to which hypothetical interventions designed to build multilevel resilience resources reduce racial/ethnic and sex differences in ideal CV health and CVD events overall and by the level of multilevel psychosocial risks. This project responds to the NIH-wide, NHLBI, OBSSR, and AHA calls to fill critical gaps in psychosocial risk, resilience, and CV outcomes research. Project Narrative This innovative project will: (a) determine whether multilevel resilience resources are associated with cardiovascular (CV) outcomes (i.e., ideal CV health and incident CV disease); (b) quantify the impacts of hypothetical multilevel resilience resource building interventions on racial/ethnic disparities and sex differences in CV outcomes; and (c) examine the degree to which the aforementioned relationships/impacts are moderated by multilevel psychosocial risks. This work will be conducted using longitudinal data on racially/ethnically diverse men and women enrolled in three United States-based CV health cohorts (i.e., JHS, MESA, MASALA) that will be harmonized to create an integrated dataset.

"Pathways to cardiovascular disease prevention and impact of specialty referral in under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV There is an urgent need to determine pathways to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention for under- represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV and elevated cardiovascular risk. Such evidence will ultimately inform clinical care guidelines and health system interventions to improve health for health disparity populations with HIV. Thus, the long-term goal of this proposal is to generate evidence-based recommendations for the management of CVD risk in PLWH. The overall objectives of this application are to demonstrate the effect of cardiology referral on CVD health outcomes in a large racially/ethnically diverse cohort of people living with HIV (PLWH), and to generate qualitative and quantitative evidence to guide development of a future intervention. Our central hypothesis is that cardiology referral reduces incident CVD events in Blacks/African-Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities with HIV compared to non-referral. The rationale for our research is that, once it is known how these health disparity populations with HIV access cardiology referrals and the subsequent impact on CVD outcomes, an interventional can be appropriately designed to test new and innovative approaches to the management of co-morbidities for PLWH at elevated CVD risk. We plan to test our central hypothesis and thereby accomplish our overall objectives by pursuing the following three specific aims: (Aim 1) To measure the association between cardiology referral and CVD outcomes in under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV, (Aim 2) To identify the individual- and health system-level factors that impact CVD outcomes for under-represented racial/ethnic minorities, and (Aim 3) To develop a qualitative framework for an intervention to improve CVD outcomes in PLWH. We will retrospectively analyze patient-level data from electronic health records from institutions in the U.S. Southeast “HIV-belt” and “Heart Attack belt”, using PCORnet’s Common Data Model. We will retrospectively identify cohorts of African- American and other under-represented racial/ethnic minorities and non-Hispanic white patients with HIV. Start date will be first clinical contact after January 1, 2010 to create a contemporary cohort with at least 5 years of longitudinal follow-up. The main independent variable is a clinic visit with a cardiologist, compared to not having such a visit, prior to first CVD event. Our primary outcome is myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, coronary heart disease, death or cardiovascular death after 5 years. Our scientific contribution is expected to be significant because we are addressing a dire health comorbidity for PLWH. Our group’s efforts are likely to contribute to greater understanding of how HIV-related CVD effects treatment outcomes among under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV. As a consequence of the work proposed, we expect to identify the underlying pathways to ideal CVD care for under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV. We anticipate results that lead to better integration and coordination of care and ultimately improve CVD health outcomes for health disparity populations with HIV. The proposed research is relevant to public health because cardiovascular disease comorbidity is a dire health concern for under-represented racial/ethnic minorities living with HIV. As a consequence of the work proposed, we expect to identify the underlying pathways leading to better cardiac health outcomes for under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV. The project is relevant to the part of the NIH's and NIMHD's missions that pertain to scientific inquiry to improve minority health and reduce health disparities.",Pathways to cardiovascular disease prevention and impact of specialty referral in under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV,9652227,R01MD013493,"['Accounting ', ' Affect ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiology ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Clinic Visits ', ' Comorbidity ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Counseling ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Female ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' HIV ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Health Insurance ', ' health insurance plan ', ' Interview ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Mission ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Management ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Testing ', ' Transportation ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Treatment outcome ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' Specialist ', ' Medication Management ', ' medication therapy management ', ' Pharmacologic Management ', ' Analgesic Management ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Death Rate ', ' Individual ', ' Trust ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' contextual factors ', ' Application Context ', ' Visit ', ' meetings ', ' blood lipid ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cohort ', ' Tobacco Use Cessation ', ' Tobacco Cessation ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Predictive Factor ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' social stigma ', ' stigma ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' Cardiac ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' informant ', ' electronic data ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' cost ', ' modeling of the data ', ' model the data ', ' model of data ', ' data modeling ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' glycemic control ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' treatment effect ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' clinical care ', ' primary outcome ', ' secondary outcome ', ' Prevention Measures ', ' Scientific Inquiry ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' healthcare disparity ', ' disparity in healthcare ', ' disparity in care ', ' health care disparity ', ' Heart health ', ' Cardiac health ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,768130,0.24276578553773878
"CVD in American Indians:  Imaging and Cardiovascular Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 �15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes. The proposed study will take advantage of the Strong Heart Study data in American Indians to further our understanding of CVD and its risk factors, especially diabetes and obesity, which will lead to more effective prevention and therapy and reduce the burden of CVD morbidity and mortality.",CVD in American Indians:  Imaging and Cardiovascular Center,9624841,R01HL109282,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemic ', ' Extended Family ', ' Family ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Nonesterified Fatty Acids ', ' Free Fatty Acids ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity -

"Disaggregating Asian American and Pacific Islander Health Data: Multilevel Analysis of Neighborhood Context and Cardiovascular Health using the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the US and for Asian Americans and Pacific Islander (AAPIs) adults age 65 and older. The prevalence of CVD has been well documented for non-Hispanic white, African American, and Hispanic populations. However, CVD morbidity and mortality disproportionately impacts AAPIs living in the US and the true magnitude of CVD by specific racial subgroup (e.g. Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander) has not been accurately characterized. The paucity of data on AAPI subgroups has resulted in the inability to precisely estimate CVD incidence and prevalence and develop appropriate clinical guidelines and recommendations for CVD research priorities. Moreover, traditional CVD risk factors (e.g. hypertension, body mass index, and diabetes) are unequally distributed across AAPI subgroups and the relative importance of these CVD risk factors is unclear. Neighborhood context (e.g. median household income, neighborhood deprivation, and rural/urban status) has been identified as an important determinant of health status and underlying factor in health disparities. However, the relationship between neighborhood context and CVD health in AAPI subgroups is not well understood. AAPIs represent more than 40 cultures of origin and 100 different languages and are projected to be the fastest growing racial group in the US by 2050. AAPI older adults will also be the fastest growing group in the US elderly population. Most AAPI older adults are foreign-born and recent immigrants to the US, and typically have low education levels, limited English proficiencies, and high poverty rates. AAPI older adults are a particularly vulnerable population as they face the compounding effects of minority group status and older age. Furthermore, these current issues are exacerbated by the absence of AAPIs in research. The primary objectives of this study are to identify the prevalence and determinants of CVD in AAPI subgroups and determine the associations between neighborhood context and individual health status in AAPI older adults through secondary data analysis of US Census Bureau data and the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS). We propose multilevel regression analysis of the HOS (N=1,017500), a nationally representative survey administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The HOS is a unique dataset that began collecting expanded ethnic and racial data in 2011, including 4 Hispanic-origin and 11 AAPI-origin categories, which allows for disaggregated analysis of AAPI subgroups (44,705 self-reported an AAPI subgroup). The HOS will be linked to geographic-level census data to investigate neighborhood factors that impact individual differences in health status. We expect that the findings will establish a better understanding of the CVD prevalence in AAPI subgroups and the intersections between neighborhood and CVD and race/ethnicity. The proposed research will inform culturally relevant strategies to improve CVD health in high-risk groups, manage CVD risk factors, and reduce CVD morbidity and mortality in diverse older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the US, and compared to whites, deaths from cardiovascular diseases have not decreased over time for some Asian and Pacific Islander subgroups (e.g. Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Other Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander). This research may provide insights on how cardiovascular disease varies between Asian and Pacific Islander older adults and how neighborhoods characteristics influence cardiovascular health status. In addition, investigating the association between neighborhood environments and race may inform culturally relevant strategies to improve CVD health status, manage CVD risk factors, and reduce CVD morbidity and mortality in diverse populations of older adults.",Disaggregating Asian American and Pacific Islander Health Data: Multilevel Analysis of Neighborhood Context and Cardiovascular Health using the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey,9584458,R36AG060132,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Censuses ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Face ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Household ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Masks ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Recommendation ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Immigrant ', ' Koreans ', ' Research Priority ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' Gray unit of radiation dose ', ' Gray ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Characteristics ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' beneficiary ', ' comparison group ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' individualized medicine ', ' health data ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' ']",NIA,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R36,2018,65156,0.13593435391620703
"Preterm birth and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease in mothers and offspring Currently about 1 of every 10 births in the US occurs preterm (gestational age <37 completed weeks), and because of advances in treatment, >95% of preterm infants survive to adulthood. Recent research has shown that both the mothers and offspring of preterm birth (PTB) have higher long-term risks of metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mothers who deliver preterm may also have higher long- term CVD incidence; however, the reported risks of CVD in adult offspring of PTB have been conflicting. A recent Trans-NIH Working Group highlighted a pressing need for studies that: (1) stratify long-term CVD risks by PTB subtype (e.g., spontaneous vs. indicated due to maternal/fetal conditions) to help elucidate underlying mechanisms and tailor long-term patient care; (2) allow longer follow-up into mid-adulthood or later when disease risks remain poorly understood; and (3) include large sample sizes to allow examination of long-term outcomes with high statistical power. We hypothesize that: (1) PTB is associated with higher long-term risks of CVD (i.e., ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, aortic disease) among mothers and adult offspring, with increasing dose-response relationships by earlier gestational age; and (2) These associations exist for all major types of PTB, but are stronger for those related to placental insufficiency (e.g., preeclampsia or diabetes), which is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to structural microvascular changes. To address these hypotheses, we propose to conduct the first comprehensive examination of PTB and its subtypes in relation to CVD risks among mothers and their adult offspring. We will assemble and analyze national databases containing all ~2.3 million births to ~1.2 million mothers in Sweden during 1973-1995 and all inpatient and outpatient diagnoses of CVD through 2015. Our specific aims are to: (1) Examine PTB and its subtypes in relation to long-term risks of CVD and CVD-related outcomes (hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea) in mothers and adult offspring; (2) determine if there are sociodemographic subgroups that are more susceptible to PTB effects on long-term risks; and (3) explore potential confounding effects of unmeasured familial (genetic and shared environmental) factors on PTB-CVD associations using co-relative analyses. The proposed research is significant because PTB is common and unprecedented numbers of survivors are now reaching adulthood (~400,000/year in the US); thus even modestly increased long-term risks translate into a large population health burden. It is innovative because it will provide the first comprehensive examination of PTB and its subtypes in relation to CVD risks, and use a co-relative design to disentangle familial confounding. It is highly cost-efficient because we will assemble these data from national registries that are unavailable or prohibitively costly to collect in the US. The results will have major impacts by establishing the long-term CVD risks associated with PTB and its subtypes among mothers and adult offspring, and informing clinical guidelines for better risk assessment and long-term care. NARRATIVE Preterm birth (PTB) is common and may be linked with higher risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the mothers and offspring. The proposed research will provide the first comprehensive examination of PTB and its subtypes in relation to long-term risks of CVD among mothers and their adult offspring, using large-scale cohort data.

"Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans ABSTRACT  This mixed-methods study utilizes a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets and qualitative data collection, to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion and Spirituality (R/S) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk factors. CVD risk factors, especially high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and depression, disproportionately affect African Americans in prevalence and/or severity, contributing to the higher associated mortality rate. Further, examining lifestyle choices (for example, diet and exercise) without appropriate sociocultural context does not provide practice-ready solutions on the manifestations, root causes and potential strategies for eliminating African American’s heightened CVD risks. As such, religion and spirituality (R/S) in the African American community have been acknowledged for their positive influence on social behaviors and emotional health, but have not been sufficiently examined for their role in attenuating or exacerbating physical health outcomes and in particular, the risks associated with CVD. Most research has compared the relationship between R/S and health outcomes by examining the specific denominations of their White participants, and blanketed Black participants’ religion to the “Black Church.” This approach disregards the diversity of beliefs, behaviors and ways of thinking found in the religious affiliation and denominations of African Americans. In a rare project that examined Black health outcomes in relation to specific religious affiliation/denomination, it was revealed that religious attendance had an inverse relationship based upon religious affiliation/denomination on black mortality rates not found in white participants. Thus, the standard of relying on religious affiliation and health studies based on White participants to determine expected outcomes for Black participants is likely to cause inaccuracies in research and interventions. The overarching goals of this research are to investigate the extent to which R/S is related to CVD risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression) through the use of robust secondary and primary data analysis. The two project Aims will use theoretically-, research- and data-driven evidence to bolster efforts to decrease CVD risk factors and improve health outcomes for African Americans. Aim 1 utilizes structural equational modeling to determine if R/S has direct and indirect effects on CVD risk factors through health behaviors. Aim 2 establishes how the relationships manifest through first-hand accounts of the attributes of specific denominations on the health outcomes of its congregants, thus allowing participants to explain how the relationships found in Aim 1 are manifested-or not, in their daily and R/S life. The purpose of this research project is to not only identify the direct and indirect relationships between CVD risk factors and R/S, but to provide in depth knowledge of core attitudes, beliefs, organizational structures, and/or practices that facilitate or attenuate positive health outcomes for African Americans. The precision and nuance of our project’s strategies will fill in significant gaps in research and practice that can be a catalyst for evidence-based interventions that examines of community and religious institutions to support positive health outcomes for African American. Project Narrative The proposed mixed-methods study will utilize a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets (Add Health, National Survey of American Life and the Jackson Heart Study) and qualitative primary data collection to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion/Spirituality (R/S) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors- including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression for African Americans, while considering religious affiliation/denomination. Our strategy will fill in significant gaps in public research and effective community and religious based interventions by providing specific and nuanced data that can help build accuracy and researcher- participant trust. Considering R/S and CVD risk factors, Aim 1 addresses what relationships are there using secondary data analysis and Aim 2 establishes how the findings in Aim 1 are manifested (or not) through interviews and focus groups with African American community members and religious leaders and congregants.","Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans",9572416,R01MD011606,"['Affect ', ' Age Factors ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Religion ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Socialization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Mediating ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Trust ', ' Protestant ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Equation ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' religious group ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Categories ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' informant ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community setting ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' Add Health ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,656622,0.21325356453542021
"Longitudinal Evaluation of Ovarian Aging and Cardiovascular Risk ABSTRACT Despite significant improvements in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the growing aging population suggests CVD will continue to pose a significant public health burden. Women are a special group where microvascular disease is more common and traditional risk factors may not fully identify risk. Women's reproductive history (e.g. menarcheal age, menstrual cycles, infertility, pregnancy, menopause) may pose unique risk and suggests an opportunity for new approaches. We propose a women-centered approach for early identification of women at risk that investigates the unique loss of reproductive function at an age long before other vital systems fail. Despite the importance of this process, little is known about the determinants or correlates of ovarian aging, or the health implications, especially in diverse populations. With reliable bio-markers of the remaining oocyte pool available, we have a unique opportunity to characterize the association between “ovarian age” and the health implications of accelerated oocyte loss. We hypothesize a risk independent of the well-known impact of early menopause and estrogen deficiency. Rather, we propose that common underlying cellular aging mechanisms, first evident in the ovary due to its sensitivity and earlier demise, make the ovary a window on underlying somatic health. Confirming an association between a decline in markers of ovarian age and CVD risk would allow a potentially high-risk population to be identified decades before traditional risk factors develop. The Ovarian Aging (OVA) cohort is the largest and most ethnically diverse, community-based cohort available that can be used to determine the race/ethnic and behavioral determinants of ovarian aging and its association with CVD risk in a young cycling population. To assess the relationship between markers of ovarian age (reflecting past exposures and genetic risk), the rate of ovarian aging (representing current exposures) and CVD risk, we propose to: 1. Determine whether markers of ovarian age/aging are associated with increased CVD risk by testing if ovarian age/aging is independently associated with increased CVD risk, as measured by peripheral endothelial function testing; 2. Determine whether ovarian aging may moderate or mediate established associations between race/ethnicity and/or socio/emotional health and CVD risk by examining whether observed race/ethnic disparities, or effects of socio/emotional health, on CVD risk, may vary by (moderation model) or be partially attributable to (mediation model) ovarian aging; and 3. Determine whether ovarian aging, CVD risk, and the temporal pattern of appearance correlate with markers of cellular aging: telomere length and mtDNA in peripheral leukocytes, oxidative stress (plasma F2α-isoprostanes), and indices of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1). Overall Impact: Our novel longitudinal approach to evaluating markers of ovarian and cellular aging as predictors of CVD could lead to a new way to identify women at earlier and/or increased CVD risk and be used to develop new risk-reduction strategies. NARRATIVE Despite significant improvements in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), women are less aware of risks for CVD and the disease is more lethal once diagnosed. The results of this study will provide detailed novel information regarding the potential correlation between ethnicity, behavioral risk factors and markers of cellular aging with ovarian age/aging and CVD risk. We hypothesize ovarian age/aging provides a window onto the general health of women - not via progressive deficiency of estrogen with menopause, but due to common underlying mechanisms first evident in young populations as lower ovarian reserve (follicle number) due to the sensitivity of the ovary.",Longitudinal Evaluation of Ovarian Aging and Cardiovascular Risk,9567450,R01AG053332,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Awareness ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' mtDNA ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' Infertility ', ' infertile ', ' fertility loss ', ' fertility cessation ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Inflammation ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Leukocytes ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Menopause ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Premature Menopause ', ' early menopause ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Methods ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Oocytes ', ' Ovocytes ', ' Ovary ', ' Plasma ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Gestation ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ', ' ICAM-1 ', ' CD54 Antigens ', ' Measures ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' telomere ', ' Mediating ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ovarian ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Reproductive Issues ', ' Reproductive History Epidemiology ', ' Reproductive Factors ', ' Reproductive History ', ' Evaluation ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' reproductive function ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Functional disorder ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Appearance ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' reproductive ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Isoprostanes ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Behavioral ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' novel strategies ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' aging population ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' Ovarian aging ', ' ovarian reserve ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2018,1494636,0.13300553117534317
"Cardiovascular Disease among Asians and Pacific Islanders (CASPER) ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the US, with total costs (including hypertension) of nearly $300 billion in 2008. The progression of CVD occurs over many years and is influenced by a series of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors that vary across populations. In the US, these factors are least well understood among Asians and Pacific Islanders. Asians are now the fastest-growing minority population in the United States, increasing 43% from 10.2 million to 14.7 million in the past decade.7 Similarly, Native Hawaiian and other Pacific Islander populations have increased by more than 35% during this same time. While Asian populations in the U.S. are commonly thought to be healthier than other minority groups and non-Hispanic Whites, emerging research suggests that some Asian subgroups and Pacific Islanders might be at higher risk for CVD and associated poor outcomes. With such population growth, the health of these populations will have an increasing impact upon future US public health care needs and costs.  This compelling CVD knowledge gap about API populations has prompted the American Heart Association and the National Lung, Heart and Blood Institute to call for research that will improve the understanding of CVD among API subpopulations.10 To fill this important gap in knowledge about health disparities among API, we will measure CVD prevalence and outcomes among 9 well-defined API populations, and comprehensively assess the role of demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors in explaining observed differences in CVD prevalence and outcomes among these groups. The multidisciplinary study team brings broad expertise in epidemiology, cardiovascular disease, and the role of social and psychological factors in health disparities. The study population will be drawn from the membership of two large, integrated health care systems located in different geographic regions with large clusters of Asian and Pacific Islander residents (Hawaii and northern California). The study will leverage the rich detail of more than a decade of clinical data contained within electronic health records (EHR) systems of both health plans. We will also collect patient reported data via a large-scale survey of 10,000 people. The study aims are to: 1. Describe differences in the prevalence of CVD among Asian, Pacific Islander, and mixed-race API subpopulations; 2. Determine whether demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors explain observed differences in CVD prevalence among these populations; and 3. Describe differences in CVD outcomes among these populations, including quality of life, and determine whether demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors explain observed differences.  Study results will provide important new evidence about underlying factors associated with CVD prevalence and outcomes among rapidly growing, diverse populations in the U.S. This information will provide strategic guidance for targeted interventions at multiple levels-provider, patient, and health system-to reduce CVD mortality and morbidity. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The results of this study will provide important new information about the underlying causes of disparities in cardiovascular disease among a rapidly growing segment of the US population, Asians and Pacific Islanders, with findings potentially relevant to other minority populations. Study results will have practical utility in the strategic design of interventions to improve primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease among Asian and Pacific Islander populations.",Cardiovascular Disease among Asians and Pacific Islanders (CASPER),9526532,R01HL126172,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Classification ', ' Systematics ', ' Data Reporting ', ' data representation ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Hawaii ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Japanese ', ' Lung ', ' pulmonary ', ' Lung Respiratory System ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Population Growth ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Psychological Factors ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Public Health ', ' Quality of life ', ' QOL ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' study design ', ' Study Type ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' Peripheral Vascular Diseases ', ' peripheral blood vessel disorder ', ' Peripheral Vascular Disorder ', ' Peripheral Angiopathies ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Chinese People ', ' Chinese ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Hawaiian population ', ' Hawaiian ', ' Knowledge ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' experience ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' Reporting ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Health system ', ' Subgroup ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Hindu ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' comparison group ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' population health ', ' Patient risk ', ' study population ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' health plans ', ' health plan ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,841019,0.17425038071217888
"Impact of Interventions on Future Trends in Subnational Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases in the US PROJECT SUMMARY Geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) – the leading cause of death in the U.S. – remain large. Since 2010, CVD death rates are no longer declining in many states, and for some groups, mortality is increasing. Reduction in CVD disparities is a major stated goal of U.S. health policy, but national-level strategies, such as Healthy People 2020 and the Million Hearts campaign, do not directly address these large geographic differences in CVD between states. The U.S. is rich in local health data, yet it is poorly integrated, so there is little evidence available to guide states or local health systems when selecting among primary prevention interventions and policies. Health policy models are an important way to integrate complex patterns of risk exposure and disease burden with other population trends including income, education, aging, migration, and health care access. Previous CVD forecasts and policy models have produced only single geography – primarily national – estimates, which cannot provide the evidence needed to address geographic disparities. The overarching goal for this study will be: a systematic analysis of why CVD patterns vary by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and state in the U.S.; how this variation will lead to future divergence in CVD mortality rates; and the variable impact that similar risk reduction strategies will then have on different U.S. states. For this work, we will adapt econometric, geospatial, and epidemiologic modelling methods by leveraging the large data and computational resources of the Global Burden of Disease Study. Aim 1 is a CVD population health projection that will estimate future burden of CVD for each U.S. state by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Using observed past trends in CVD and major modifiable causal risk factors, we will project health loss due to CVD, including disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), through 2040 for each U.S. state. We will integrate multiple sources of existing health surveillance data with the results of state-level health examination surveys. Estimates will be produced separately by sex and 5-year age groups, for four collectively exhaustive race/ethnicity categories for CVD overall, and separately for ischemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, aortic aneurysm, and chronic kidney disease. Aim 2 is a new set of CVD health policy models that estimate the impact within each state of interventions shown to improve the delivery of pharmacotherapies that lower blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol. Aim 3 is a new set of CVD health policy models that estimate the impact of behavioral interventions shown to reduce CVD risk factors. Projections and policy models for CVD are a necessary step in reducing U.S. health disparities. Our results will be able to guide local decision-makers considering a range of policy options to reduce the burden of CVD. We will then implement a broad dissemination plan designed to expand the impact of our work beyond academic audiences, providing webinars, policy reports, and outreach to health departments and other stakeholders actively engaged in policy work in key states. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is a systematic analysis of why the burden of cardiovascular diseases vary by race/ethnicity and state in the U.S., the extent to which this variation will lead to future divergence in mortality rates, and the variable impact that similar risk reduction strategies will have on different U.S. states. This project will build on the data and computational infrastructure of the Global Burden of Disease Study to: a) produce a new set of population health projections stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, estimating the trajectory of cardiovascular diseases for the next 20 years in each U.S. state, and b) develop new health policy models that allow each state to examine the local impact of a broad range of interventions that improve cardiometabolic health. The results of this project will provide new evidence on the impact of interventions tailored to each U.S. state, allowing policymakers to improve their selection of policies that can reduce

"Predicting and Preventing Hospital Readmission in Patients with Diabetes and CVD ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this K23 proposal is to train Daniel J. Rubin, MD, MSc for a career as an independent investigator in the prediction and prevention of hospital readmission among patients with diabetes. Readmissions within 30 days of discharge (30d readmissions) are a high-priority quality measure and target for cost reduction. Patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are disproportionately over- represented in 30d readmissions, especially among racial minorities and urban populations. Currently there is no validated method to identify diabetic patients admitted for CVD at the highest risk of 30d readmission, which is a critical prerequisite for targeting limited resources fr reducing readmission risk to those most in need. Furthermore, there are no proven interventions to reduce the risk of 30d readmission specifically among patients with diabetes. Dr. Rubin plans to address these gaps in knowledge with 2 aims, 1) validating and refining a Diabetes Early Readmission Risk Index (DERRI-CVD) for predicting 30d readmission risk in diabetic patients admitted for CVD, and 2) assessing the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, multifactorial intervention designed to reduce 30d readmissions. The intervention adapts methods successfully used in other inpatient populations to diabetic patients hospitalized for CVD and will target those identified as high risk for readmission based on the DERRI-CVD. There are 2 Phases to the proposed research that address these aims: Phase 1 uses a new retrospective cohort of diabetic patients to validate and refine the DERRI-CVD for prediction of 30d readmission risk; Phase 2 involves a single-arm pilot trial to qualitatively assess the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. In order to successfully complete the proposed research and build on skills to achieve the overall goal of independence, Dr. Rubin will receive additional training through formal coursework and structured mentorship in the following: validating and refining predictive models, clinical trials, and principles of hospital quality improvement with a focus on readmission prediction and prevention. A distinguished group of senior investigators will serve as mentors and advisors to supervise Dr. Rubin's research and career development. The proposed research and training will help Dr. Rubin acquire skills, establish a body of work in this area and generate preliminary data to support a competitive R01 application to test the readmission risk reduction intervention in a randomized controlled trial. Such work is highly relevant in the current era of soaring health care costs and national health care reform. This proposal will enable Dr. Rubin to develop into a successful independent investigator while improving patient care and reducing readmission disparities through clinical research. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Hospital readmissions within 30 days of discharge are a common and expensive problem. Patients with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, especially racial minorities and urban populations, are at particularly high risk of readmission. The proposed research will verify and improve the accuracy of a new tool to predict 30 day readmission risk and explore the feasibility and acceptability of patient education, adjustment of diabetes medications, and coordination of care by specialized nurses and community health workers during and after hospitalization to reduce 30 day readmissions among patients with diabetes hospitalized for cardiovascular disease.",Predicting and Preventing Hospital Readmission in Patients with Diabetes and CVD,9439789,K23DK102963,"['Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' General Hospitals ', ' University Hospitals ', ' Hypoglycemia ', ' hypoglycemic episodes ', ' hypoglycemic ', ' indexing ', ' Inpatients ', ' Lipids ', ' Massachusetts ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Nurses ', ' nurse ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Supervision ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' United States Dept. of Health and Human Services ', ' United States Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Department of Health and Human Services ', ' Urban Population ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' base ', ' career ', ' urban area ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Hospitalization cost ', ' Hospital Costs ', ' Healthcare Reform ', ' Health Reform ', ' Health Care Reform ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Techniques ', ' Medical center ', ' Hospital Readmission ', ' readmission ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' economic cost ', ' Prevention ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' diabetes mellitus therapy ', ' diabetes therapy ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' pilot trial ', ' cost ', ' risk prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' prediction model ', ' computer based prediction ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Information Technology ', ' glycemic control ', ' Population ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' diabetic patient ', ' clinical practice ', ' population health ', ' arm ', ' socioeconomic disparity ', ' stratified patient ', ' patient stratification ', ' racial minority ', ' Retrospective cohort ', ' readmission risk ', ' readmission rates ', ' coordinating care ', ' care coordination ', ' Boston ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' ']",NIDDK,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,K23,2018,192631,0.11575462276076222
"Patient perspectives on primary statin nonadherence Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the United States' leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and health care costs, but proven CVD risk reduction strategies are often not fully used. Medications such as HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as “statins,” can reduce CVD risks. However, up to 34% of patients never fill a newly prescribed statin (primary nonadherence), and consequently fail to reduce their CVD risk. Data about primary nonadherence are sparse. The limited data counterintuitively suggest higher rates of primary statin nonadherence in some populations at greater risk for CVD, such as blacks and Hispanics/ Latinos, but the reasons for these disparities are unknown. There is incomplete information about the interplay of patient, healthcare system and provider factors underlying primary nonadherence, and about the type and content of motivational strategies that might encourage primary statin adherence. It is crucial to accurately identify reasons for primary statin nonadherence order to ultimately help people lower their CVD risk. The long-term goal of this research agenda is to reduce CV risk by developing patient-targeted tailored interventions to promote medication adherence. This study will contribute a comprehensive understanding of the reasons that patients choose not to fill a newly prescribed statin, and patient preferences for solutions to overcome primary nonadherence. This cross-sectional study has two phases. In Phase 1, focus group and semi-structured interviews with middle-aged and older white, black, and English- and Spanish-speaking Hispanic/Latino patients will yield open-ended data exploring the range of reasons patients decide not to fill initial statin prescriptions (focusing on patient attitudes and beliefs), and solicit ideas for potential solutions to overcome these barriers. In Phase 2, we will develop and pilot-test a structured survey with a separate patient cohort (Aim 2). Cognitive interviews will be used to refine survey content and wording. Eligible study patients will be identified by querying standardized databases from a PCORnet (PCORI's National Clinical Research Network) Patient-Powered Research Network (Health eHeart) (Phase 1) and from a PCORnet Clinical Data Research Network (pScanner) and the University of California healthcare system (UC ReX) for Phases 1 and 2. The study's specific aims are to: 1) determine: a) patient attitudes, beliefs, and other factors associated with primary statin nonadherence and b) patient suggestions to overcome these barriers; and 2) develop and pilot-test English- and Spanish-language surveys to understand patient characteristics (e.g., demographics, health) related to: a) patient-reported reasons for primary statin nonadherence and b) preferred strategies to overcome primary statin nonadherence. We expect this study to provide critical preliminary information for the design and conduct of a future larger-scale survey, which will in turn inform the content of tailored patient-targeted interventions to reduce primary statin nonadherence, and ultimately reduce CVD risks. Relevance to Public Health Primary statin nonadherence (when patients fail to fill a newly prescribed statin medication) is a major obstacle to cardiovascular disease reduction in a significant fraction of the at-risk American public. Minorities and older patients are at greatest risk for cardiovascular disease, but some studies suggest that they also have higher rates of primary nonadherence. Comprehensive knowledge about mutable barriers to primary statin nonadherence among different groups of patients is a requisite first step to developing interventions that can address this important gap in our national cardiovascular prevention strategy.",Patient perspectives on primary statin nonadherence,9501681,R21AG055832,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' Medication ', ' Drugs ', ' Elements ', ' Fright ', ' Fear ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Industry ', ' Interview ', ' Language ', ' Medical Records ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Persons ', ' Oxidoreductase ', ' Reductases ', ' Oxidoreductase Gene ', ' Dehydrogenases ', ' Patients ', ' Perception ', ' Pharmacology ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Medical Societies ', ' Standardization ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Suggestion ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Measures ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino ', ' Comprehension ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Individual ', ' data base ', ' Data Bases ', ' Databases ', ' world wide web ', ' web ', ' WWW ', ' Internet ', ' Patient Preferences ', ' Knowledge ', ' Dependence ', ' System ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Reporting ', ' health belief ', ' health-related belief ', ' Adverse effects ', ' treatment adverse effect ', ' therapy adverse effect ', ' side effect ', ' Treatment Side Effects ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' prevent ', ' preventing ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Data ', ' Clinical Data ', ' Cognitive ', ' Characteristics ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' medication adherence ', ' drug compliance ', ' drug adherence ', ' medication compliance ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' elderly patient ', ' older patient ', ' Population ', ' stem ', ' demographics ', ' tailored approach ', ' precision approach ', ' individualized approach ', ' Personalized medical approach ', ' personalized approach ', ' patient-provider communication ', ' patient-doctor communication ', ' patient-clinician communication ', ' modifiable behavior ', ' ']",NIA,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,R21,2018,173268,0.17046376411748493
"Extending a Caribbean Based Cohort to Promote US-Caribbean Comparisons to Facilitate Research Addressing Black Health Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fifty percent of Non-Hispanic Black immigrants in the United States (US) originate from the Caribbean. Thus the health of US and Caribbean populations are closely intertwined due to both regional proximity and the high volume of Caribbean immigration to the US3. US and Caribbean Blacks also share disease burden; cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) account for their greatest health disparities-- killing more Black individuals in the US and the Caribbean than any other ethnic/racial group. Yet, there is a paucity of cancer and CVD comparative research between the US-born Black American and African-Caribbean sub-groups. While the NIH has invested in studying US minority/immigrant populations, comparisons with Caribbean cohorts are needed to untangle the effect of biological, environmental, behavioral, and cultural health care system determinants of CVD and cancer risk and outcomes. In partnership with the University of the West Indies (UWI), the African Caribbean Cancer Consortium (AC3) is already making headway into expanding an existing population-based cohort for cancer and CVD research in Jamaica. The Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey (JHLS-III), conducted in 2016-17, is a national representative sample of over 3000 persons. The JHLS-III collected bio-specimens and epidemiological data on CVD, cancer, other chronic diseases and their risk factors, and medical history. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other nationally representative population-based cohorts in the Caribbean specifically targeting cancer combined with other chronic diseases. With an NCI-P20 award, the AC3, an NCI-Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program supported consortium at Fox Chase Cancer Center and UWI have established a Caribbean Regional Center of Research Excellence in Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer. This proposal will be a natural extension of this project by expanding the JHLS-III and building the data mining, storage and analytics infrastructure needed to harness and share data from epidemiological measures and biospecimens to promote comparative research in cancer and cardiometabolic disease. This proposed infrastructure building project will harness and prepare multi-level data for future US-Caribbean comparative studies. We propose to optimize enrollment and retention of Caribbean nationals in cohort studies by (a) obtaining multi-stakeholder input and feedback from community health nurses/field workers and JHLS-III 2016/17 cohort participants to refine targeted enrollment and retention strategies; and (b) evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy relative to historical enrollment and retention rates. We will repurpose and expand the JHLS-III into a robust longitudinal cohort of 8,000 participants, collect and store biospecimens, socioecological and health status data in order to answer questions about NCD (i.e. cancer and CVD) risk and outcomes. We will establish a secure data integration and sharing platform that will enable linkages of the Jamaica cohort with the CAP3 study and other Caribbean and US-based cohorts, and conduct preliminary analytics for data verification and harmonization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the diversity of the US Black population and their disproportionate cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality, comparative studies of African American/immigrant Black populations with Black populations of their native countries must be prioritized to address health disparities in the US. The goal of this proposal is to repurpose and expand an existing Caribbean-based survey into a robust longitudinal cohort that will support US-Caribbean research to facilitate the identification of Black health disparities. This study will produce harmonized data and biospecimen collection methods; subsequently, facilitating an increase in data and biospecimen sharing and comparability with US-based national datasets.",Extending a Caribbean Based Cohort to Promote US-Caribbean Comparisons to Facilitate Research Addressing Black Health Disparities,9606334,R01MD013347,"['Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Community Health Nursing ', ' Community Health Nurse Specialist ', ' Community Health Nurse ', ' Clinical Specialist in Community Health Nursing ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Data Collection ', ' Delaware ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Feedback ', ' Field Workers ', ' Fieldworker ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immigration ', ' Incidence ', ' Interviewer ', ' Jamaica ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mouthwash ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' West Indies ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Data Set ', ' Dataset ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Medical History ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' instrument ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' programs ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' Country ', ' cancer risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Effectiveness ', ' data mining ', ' datamining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Subgroup ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' COBRE ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' data integration ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance study ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' sharing data ', ' Secure ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' retention rate ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Jamaican ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2018,661677,0.1628325227927161
"CVD in American Indians  Study and Data Management Center and OK Field Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 �15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Steadily decreasing rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US threaten to be reversed because of rapid increases in obesity and diabetes. The proposed study will take advantage of the Strong Heart Study data in American Indians to further our understanding of CVD and its risk factors, especially diabetes and obesity, which will lead to more effective prevention and therapy and reduce the burden of CVD morbidity and mortality.",CVD in American Indians  Study and Data Management Center and OK Field Center,9624870,R01HL109284,"['Abdomen ', ' Abdominal ', ' Adipose tissue ', ' yellow adipose tissue ', ' white adipose tissue ', ' adipose ', ' Fatty Tissue ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alleles ', ' Allelomorphs ', ' American Indians ', ' American Indian ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Physiology ', ' cardiovascular function ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Epidemic ', ' Extended Family ', ' Family ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Nonesterified Fatty Acids ', ' Free Fatty Acids ', ' Foundations ', ' Gene Expression ', ' Genes ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Inflammation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Kidney Diseases ', ' renal disorder ', ' kidney disorder ', ' Renal Disease ', ' Nephropathy ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Liver ', ' hepatic organ system ', ' hepatic body system ', ' Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' Zeugmatography ', ' Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging ', ' NMR Tomography ', ' NMR Imaging ', ' Medical Imaging, Magnetic Resonance / Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ', ' MRI ', ' MR Tomography ', ' MR Imaging ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Morbidity -

"The role of epigenetic transcriptional memory in monocyte-macrophage cells and cardiovascular disease risk Project Summary/Abstract This proposal details a five-year training program to support the candidate to achieve his long-term career goal of building a successful independent transdisciplinary research program featuring clinical, immunology, and epigenetic research to address the impact of epigenetic transcriptional memory in immune cells on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in minority populations. The candidate has a strong scientific skillset and knowledge in epigenetics that provides a solid background to ensure his success in pursuing transdisciplinary clinical research focused on CVD. The candidate seeks to focus his career development and enhance his experience and technical research skills in immunology and clinical CVD research. The candidate will acquire essential research skills including flow cytometry, in vitro and ex-vivo monocyte/macrophage functional assays of human cells, and integrative bioinformatics to establish his independence in using his expertise in epigenetics to address CVD. He has already established his own independent research project aimed at defining the role of epigenetic regulation of monocyte/macrophage cellular responses across ethnicities with CVD health disparities. The scientific and institutional environment at the University of Hawaii is well-matched to ensuring the candidate achieves his career goals to study the immune system and CVD. There are multiple independently funded research programs such as the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Research, COBRE Diabetes Center, and Research Multidisciplinary and Translational Research Infrastructure Expansion project that will provide shared resources and core facilities and offer numerous collaborative opportunities in cardiometabolic disease research. A key component of the research career development plan is mentorship from a multi-disciplinary mentoring team focused on cardiovascular disease research consisting of immunology, clinical, and health disparity research experts committed toward contributing their expertise to support the candidate’s career development and expand his research training. The candidate will pursue a hypothesis that dysfunctional monocyte responses associated with high cardiovascular disease risk are related to epigenomic programming differences at inflammatory and metabolic genes and are exacerbated in Native Hawaiians compared to Caucasians. To test this hypothesis, a cross-sectional study of viably cryopreserved blood specimens from 200 Native Hawaiians and age gender research project aimed at addressing the matched Caucasians with clinically defined high and low CVD risk. The specific aims are (1) To measure and compare functional responses of isolated monocyte and macrophage cells from NHOPI and Caucasians with clinically defined low or high CVD risk in the Multiethnic cohort. (2) Determine if epigenetically regulated inflammatory and metabolic genes in isolated monocyte cells from NHOPI and Caucasians associate with CVD risk and differ by ethnicity. (3) Within monocytes from high CVD risk NHOPI and Caucasians, to examine the impact of metformin on the epigenetic state of inflammatory and metabolic genes. Project Narrative Cardiovascular disease disproportionately affects ethnic/racial minorities.

"Early Psychosocial Intervention and Child and Parent Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary/Abstract The roots of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is responsible for 32% of all deaths in the U.S., can be found during the early years, beginning perinatally. Although psychosocial interventions in populations across a wide age range have been shown to improve behavioral, mental health, and physical health outcomes, the development of effective early CVD prevention strategies and a deeper understanding of the ways in which psychosocial family factors interact to promote or reduce CVD risk are needed. The proposed project will build on the Family Foundations (FF) intervention, an ongoing NICHD-funded (PI: Feinberg, HD058529) randomized controlled trial of a perinatal intervention focused on coparenting, to examine the psychosocial pathways within the family that influence child and parent CVD risk. Additionally, we will examine potential intervention effects of FF on child and parent CVD risk. As part of the proposed project, we will augment the planned home visits (N = 294 families) which include questionnaire and family interaction data collection by adding the collection of baseline blood pressure, dried blood spot samples for the assessment of metabolic and inflammatory CVD risk markers, and important potential moderators of CVD risk. First, using these data and taking advantage of data available from three previous waves of data collection, we will develop models of interactive psychosocial influences on parent and child CVD risk. Specifically, this will include the consideration of child factors (e.g., behavioral problems), parent factors (e.g., depression), and family climate factors (e.g., parenting quality, family chaos and conflict), which we expect to interact and also contribute to CVD risk in unique ways. Second, we will test the extent to which these child, parent, and family factors mediate any effect of the FF intervention on CVD. Third, we will examine whether key external risk factors (parents’ lifetime socioeconomic status (SES) and adversity and children’s lifetime SES and birth weight) moderate any associations between child, parent, and family factors and CVD risk and whether they moderate main effects of the intervention on CVD risk. This research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of scientists who specialize in intervention research, psychosocial influences on health, minimally invasive field-based biomarker collection, and socioeconomic health disparities. The data resulting from this project will increase our understanding of the pathways through which the psychosocial family environment influences CVD risk and whether a psychosocial intervention can reduce CVD risk. By examining the moderating role of lifetime adversity and SES, the study will further inform future intervention research to unlock the potential of such interventions to reduce SES-based CVD disparities. Project Narrative The origins of cardiovascular disease can be found in early life. This project aims to understand how mechanisms within the family influence physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease among children and parents. We will do this by assessing parents and children part of an ongoing coparenting intervention trial, which will furthermore allow us to study potential effects of such an intervention on parent and child cardiovascular disease risk, and may inform future prevention efforts.",Early Psychosocial Intervention and Child and Parent Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9469828,R01HL137809,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Autopsy ', ' postmortem ', ' necropsy ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' youngster ', "" childrens' "", ' children ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' Child Youth ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Rearing ', ' childrearing ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' Parenting ', ' Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Fetus ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birthweight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birth weight ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Longevity ', ' lifespan ', ' life span ', ' Length of Life ', ' Mental Health ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' wellbeing ', ' well-being ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' randomized controlled study ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Metabolic ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Home environment ', ' Home ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' psychosocial ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' experience ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' Interventional trial ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' parental influence ', ' parent influence ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Data ', ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' NICHD ', ' Collection ', ' Observational research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observation research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Risk Marker ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' post intervention ', ' home visit ', ' House Call ', ' Home visitation ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' family influence ', ' perinatal intervention ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' therapy design ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' minimally invasive ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Biological Markers ', ' intervention effect ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' maternal adiposity ', ' maternal obesity ', ' experimental research ', ' experiment ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2018,434999,0.23453891713942904
"Estrogen-Mediated Impairments of Vascular Health in Diabetes Diabetes has recently been referred to as “the epidemic of the 21st century” and contributes to a substantial economic burden on the United States public health. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 80% of morbidity and mortality in diabetes, however, women with type 1 diabetes have a substantially greater risk for CVD compared to men with diabetes. A critical barrier to understanding this sexual dimorphism in CVD risk is the lack of knowledge regarding the role of estrogen (E2) on vascular health in diabetic women. Oxidative stress is a common phenotype in patients with diabetes and is routinley associated with hyperglycemia and diabetic complications. In addition, sirtuin1 (Sirt1) has been proposed to play a fundemental role in regulating nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and is lower in patients with diabetes. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that an elevated concentration of E2 in women with type 1 diabetes contributes to a reduction in NO- bioavailability and vascular health through two separate pathways; an increase in oxidative stress and a decrease in circulating Sirt1. In support, compelling preliminary data indicate that the natural increase in vascular health from menses to the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle is lost in the presence of type 1 diabetes. In addition, this loss is associated with increased oxidative stress and lower Sirt1. To investigate the impact of E2 on vascular health in women with diabetes, we propose to utilize the menstrual cycle as a natural and novel method to investigate changes in sex-steroid hormones. We will perform a comprehensive assessment of vascular health in men and at two different times during the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women with and without type 1 diabetes: 1) during the menses (low estrogen/low progesterone) and 2) late follicular (elevated estrogen/low progesterone) phases. In addition, we will employ two novel treatments that may mitigate future CVD risk in patients with diabetes. Findings will not only contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with sex disparities of CVD risk in diabetes, they may identify novel therapeutic approaches to decrease estrogen-mediated vascular dysfunction in women with diabetes. This proposal demonstrates the true model of translational research and represents a major shift in the approach to understanding the sexual dimorphism of CVD risk in patients with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes has recently been referred to as “the epidemic of the 21st century”. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 80% of diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality and women with type 1 diabetes suffer substantially more risk for CVD compared to men with diabetes. However, the reason for this sex-disparity in CVD risk is unknown. Findings from this proposal will not only uncover circulating levels of estrogen throughout the menstrual cycle as a contributor of poor vascular health, it will identify 2 potential therapeutic treatment options to improve blood vessel function in patients with type 1 diabetes.",Estrogen-Mediated Impairments of Vascular Health in Diabetes,9448755,R01HL137087,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Ascorbic Acid ', ' Vitamin C ', ' VIT C ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Experimental Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Experimental Diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Epidemic ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' proliferative phase Menstrual cycle ', ' Preovulatory Phase ', ' Menstrual Proliferative Phase ', ' Follicular Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Follicular Phase ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' indexing ', ' Iontophoresis ', ' iontophoresis therapy ', ' Drug Iontophoresis ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Thioctic Acid ', ' alpha-Lipoic Acid ', ' Lipoic Acid ', ' 1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Menstruation ', ' monthly period ', ' menstrual period ', ' Menses ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI Persons with serious mental illness (SMI) comprise one of the most highly vulnerable groups in the US, dying 10 to 20 years earlier and with mortality rates two to over three times higher than the overall population. Much of this premature death is attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is potentially preventable; all CVD risk behaviors (unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco smoking) and risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia) are markedly elevated in persons with SMI. Concomitantly, persons with SMI often receive poor quality of care for these conditions. While these health and mortality gaps are widely recognized as a public health crisis, individual, provider, organizational, and policy level barriers impede progress. While many persons with SMI receive most of their care from the public mental health sector, tailored interventions to decrease CVD risk shown effective in clinical trials for those with SMI (e.g., for weight loss, smoking cessation) have not been widely adopted in community mental health settings. Meaningfully advancing health and decreasing mortality disparities for persons with SMI requires urgent development and testing of implementation strategies for scale-up of practical, effective interventions.  In response to this extraordinary burden of years of life lost, our goal is to create the Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI that will use cutting-edge transdisciplinary methods towards short and long-term progress to reduce CVD risk in this highly vulnerable population. The Center’s uniquely qualified team will conduct 3 R34 studies to develop and pilot test innovative implementation strategies to address all CVD risk behaviors and risk factors in persons with SMI in community mental health settings. The R34s will focus on evidence-based approaches for: 1) behavioral weight loss with diet and physical activity; 2) tobacco smoking cessation treatment; 3) care delivery for diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. The Methods Core will use a transdisciplinary approach incorporating clinical and behavioral intervention research, implementation science, human factors engineering, systems science, and health services research to support Center research. The Methods Core will also advance research methods in 1) human factors engineering to support implementation; 2) avatar-assisted training and assessment in motivational interviewing; 3) quantitative methods to support intervention scale-up; 4) and systems science. The Administrative Core will engage stakeholders, building on well-established partnerships in Maryland and nationally, and bring together all of the Center’s activities. The gaping differential in life expectancy and CVD risk factor burden in persons with SMI calls for concentrated, transdisciplinary approaches to solutions. This Center will create a nexus of innovation and momentum around T2 translation to reduce premature mortality in SMI. Our vision is health equity – that persons with SMI, similar to persons without SMI, live long healthy lives. Persons with serious mental illness (SMI) are one of the most highly vulnerable groups in the US, dying 10 to 20 years earlier than the overall population, primarily due to cardiovascular disease. The proposed Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI will develop and test innovative strategies for scaling-up effective interventions to address cardiovascular risk behaviors (unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco smoking) and risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia) among consumers with SMI.

"Informing Cardiovascular Disease Prevention among Rural Appalachian Women: A Community-Engaged Mixed Method Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In Appalachia, a largely rural and low socioeconomic status region, premature mortality rates are 25 percent higher than all US counties.1,2 Appalachian populations have significantly higher rates of heart disease mortality compared to national averages,3 including high rates for women.4,5 With high proportions of uncontrolled risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD),6-8 the need for strategies to increase CVD screening rates among rural Appalachian women is a public health priority.9 A comprehensive exploration of the complex and interconnected barriers and facilitators for CVD preventative screenings is required to better understand decision-making.10,11 Recommended screening for CVD covers physiologic tests (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure) and self-reported behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity).12,13 However, the completion and follow-up from screenings by rural Appalachian women remains low.11 This research builds upon available Appalachian disparity research, which suggests a range of interconnected factors combine to affect screening decision-making by rural Appalachian women.14-27 As a gap exists between knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs and screening behavior,17,20,26 this mixed method study consists of context-specific strategies to uncover interconnections between individual, social, and environmental levels and to inform interventions to increase CVD preventative screenings by rural Appalachian women.17,18 Through a novel community-engaged mixed method approach of combining spatial analysis and concept mapping, this research aims to: 1) Assess the association of county-level resource distribution and cardiovascular health outcomes for women to identify varying patterns among the rural Appalachian counties of PA and 2) Identify community perceptions of the range of barriers and facilitators to the receipt of preventive CVD screenings by rural Appalachian women. The proposed study will inform the Healthy People 2020 goal to assess health disparities in relation to demographic factors such as gender, SES, and geographic location28 and will address NHLBI’s critical challenges to further explore sex/gender-specificity in research and to advance methods for characterizing exposures to understand differences in health among populations.29 To facilitate this research, I will undertake educational and training opportunities to develop skills and knowledge in: 1) CVD prevention among women, 2) spatial analysis, 3) concept mapping methodology, 4) the role of environmental and community-level factors that affect rural women’s health in the Appalachian region, and 5) expand skills in action-oriented research with community partners. I will conduct the proposed research with support from a dedicated and multi-disciplinary mentorship team in a resource-rich environment at the University of Pittsburgh. Upon successful completion of this fellowship, I will be well-poised to meet my long-term goals of attaining a faculty position and having an independent scientific research career in chronic disease prevention, health disparities, and community-based research with specialties in rural and female Appalachian populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will enhance the understanding of the complex and interconnected factors affecting the receipt of cardiovascular disease preventative screenings by women in the Appalachian region.

Guided by a precision health ecological framework, this center aims to (1) promote innovative research on the complexity, relatedness, biodiversity, and impact on individuals and families of MetS and MCC using a precision health ecological perspective, including biomarkers (genetics/genomics), ancestry, community, and environmental factors and the NINR CDE; (2) develop and sustain a research infrastructure to support and accelerate early career scientists in exploring MetS and MCC in diverse individuals and families from a precision health ecological perspective; and (3) facilitate the development of sustainable interdisciplinary collaborative teams dedicated to advancing the science of MCC by obtaining external funding and conducting impactful research. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a set of inter-related health conditions placing individuals at serious risk for T2D and CVD. MetS is a prodromal state that sets the stage for CVD and T2D. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and obesity are common factors that comprise MetS. MetS is present in ~ 35% of adults in the US. A family history of MCC that includes type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and early cardiovascular disease (CVD) greatly increases the chance that an individual will develop MetS. Genetics and environment play a role in chronic conditions; this is particularly true of MetS. Other causes of MetS and associated T2D and CVD risk include genetic susceptibility, family history, low education and socioeconomic status, increased body mass index (BMI), and lifestyle factors, especially sedentary lifestyle/lack of regular physical activity; diet high in refined carbohydrates, sugar, and saturated fat; cigarette smoking; and substance use 1-6. Research that expands our understanding of biomarkers, lifestyle, contextual, and environmental impacts on phenotypic expression of MetS and related MCC among diverse, vulnerable populations is lacking and critically needed. The infrastructure will include 3 Cores-Administrative Core guided by an Executive Committee and an External Advisory Committee; Pilot Administrative Core with Pilot Feasibility Funding and a Scientific Review Committee; Precision Technology Resource Core, and an Enrichment Program. Two pilot projects will address symptom clusters and biomarkers of MetS related to sleep duration and fatigue. The NYU Meyers College of Nursing has faculty investigators and research scientists with programs of biobehavioral research, funded by NIH, CDC, NSF, and foundations ($9.3 million in direct costs), that address risk, management, and intervention for MCC. These researchers will serve as mentors, collaborators, and resources for the Center pilot PIs and their collaborators. The Center will allow for more individualized care and extend nursing science by offering biomarker, genetic/genomic, biobehavioral, lifestyle, and environmental explanations that will inform nursing care for diverse populations with symptoms of MetS. Project Narrative The goal of the NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations is to develop nurse scientists, and interdisciplinary teams dedicated to research that will expand knowledge on metabolic syndrome (MetS) and related multiple chronic conditions (MCC), their biological mechanisms, modifiable risk factors, and best interventions to reduce or eliminate MCC burden in diverse adult populations, within the context of individual, family and community.",P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations,9606322,P20NR018075,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Biology ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Communities ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity -

"Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges ABSTRACT CVD disparities across the race/ethnic and socioeconomic gradients are exacerbated by barriers to receiving guideline-based primary or secondary preventive treatment—such as appropriate blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes treatment.1–6 Most patients not receiving guideline-based treatment are actually insured and have seen a primary care provider in the past year.1 To reduce CVD disparities by better targeting disease prevention and treatment, healthcare administrators and county departments of public health have begun pooling data resources across healthcare and public health systems—such as across clinics, emergency rooms and hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and administrative datasets.7–9 The idea behind pooling such datasets is to better identify persons most in need, and direct targeted interventions to them. Solano County, California, a medium-sized, diverse, low-income county, has developed one of the first, and most comprehensive health information exchanges (HIEs), including: (i) electronic health record data from all emergency rooms, hospitals, primary care and specialty clinics and care facilities in the county; (ii) labs from all laboratory service providers; (iii) prescription details from all pharmacies; (iv) validated social determinants of health surveys administered in clinics; and (v) administrative datasets, including welfare, disability, housing, and geocoded neighborhood features. While several other counties are following suit to develop large, secure HIEs across healthcare and public health systems, a key challenge remains: how to cheaply, accurately, and rapidly analyze HIEs to identify which persons should be targeted for interventions. Without reliable, user- friendly, cost-effective, and generalizable data analysis programs, counties are unable to use the massive data at their disposal to address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this application is to apply our unique machine-learning innovations to develop open-source programs that can enable counties to identify persons at high risk for preventable CVD events and deaths. We will test the hypothesis that electronic health record data alone are insufficient to provide accurate risk prediction for preventable CVD events and deaths. Rather, we believe that key survey and administrative data providing information on social determinants of health will improve identification of high-risk patients. To test our hypothesis, we will develop and validate open-source, generalizable programs to: (Aim 1) rapidly identify persons in need of improved primary and secondary prevention of CVD by systematically comparing the performance of three alternative machine learning approaches to read HIE data, as compared to human clinician chart reviewers; and (Aim 2) perform multi-level risk assessment by automatically calibrating and validating models of CVD event risk, utilization and cost to HIE data, to identify the added value of administrative and social determinants data as compared to clinical or claims-based data alone. Our work will produce generalizable software tools for counties across the country to analyze HIE data and reduce preventable CVD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are exacerbated by inadequate guideline-based treatment of CVD risk factors. Furthermore, risk adjustment models currently used to target interventions and pay for healthcare services only use claims-based data such as demographics and clinical diagnostic codes, ignoring social determinants of health. Our research will rigorously develop and test novel machine learning methods that incorporate social determinants data from large Health Information Exchanges, producing novel data tools that will enable health systems nationwide to better detect individuals who could use improvements in their preventive therapy for CVD, and improve risk adjustment models to identify persons at high risk for preventable healthcare utilization and cost.",Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges,9584874,R21MD012867,"['Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Data Analyses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' MODY ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health Personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Surveys ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Information Systems ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Cardiovascular Models ', ' Morbidity -

"Levels of trimethylamine metabolites and their associations with dietary intakes and cardiometabolic biomarkers: the TMAO Pooling Project PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a growing appreciation that diet-gut microbiota interactions play an important role in human cardiovascular health. Recent studies have discovered a diet-derived, gut microbiota-dependent metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which may promote the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). So far, only a few small studies among general populations have investigated this novel TMAO-CVD pathway. Limited evidence suggests that TMAO production and metabolism is influenced by both dietary and non-dietary factors, and that the diet-TMAO association may vary across populations due to significant variations in TMAO food sources (e.g., meat vs. fish vs. plant foods). Large-scale, collaborative epidemiologic studies that include ethnically and regionally diverse populations and incorporate comprehensive data on diet, TMAO metabolites, and CVD biomarkers will provide critical insights into this meta-organismal pathway and may pave the way for developing new strategies for CVD prevention and treatment based on diet-gut microbiota interactions.  We propose to conduct a large, international, collaborative study: the TMAO Pooling Project. It will be primarily based on the newly established Consortium of Metabolomics Studies (COMETS) and will also include several other population-based studies. As of Oct. 2017, we have recruited 18 studies from the US, Europe, and Asia, bringing a total of 44,164 participants, including 51% women and 46% understudied racial/ethnic groups (i.e., blacks, Hispanic/Latinos, and Asians). Our Specific Aims are: 1) to examine distributions of TMAO and related metabolites (i.e., choline, carnitine, and betaine) across populations by age, sex, region, race/ethnicity, obesity, smoking status, and metabolic disease status; 2) to evaluate associations of TMAO metabolites with intakes of trimethylamine-containing foods including potential variations across populations; and 3) to evaluate associations of TMAO metabolites with known CVD biomarkers (e.g., glucose, blood lipids, and inflammatory markers). We hypothesize that TMAO level may differ across populations due to variations in habitual diets and metabolic disease status, which in turn may affect CVD health in these populations.  This will be the first, large-scale, multi-ethnic, multi-national metabolomics study that leverages existing data and consortium resources to investigate this novel diet-TMAO-CVD pathway. It is feasible and extremely time- and cost-efficient. Knowledge gained will help elucidate the distribution, influencing factors, and potential effects of TMAO on CVD. This study will lay a foundation for future studies on the role of diet-gut microbiota interactions in the development of CVD among diverse populations, which may eventually lead to new, population-specific strategies for CVD prevention and treatment via dietary and/or gut microbial modifications. Meanwhile, this study will establish a network for collaborations on emerging topics in CVD research such as gut microbiota, metabolomics, and health disparities, and will foster career development of junior investigators in these areas as they collaborate and learn from senior investigators and their peers. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a dietary-gut microbial metabolite and a promising novel biomarker for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We propose to conduct a collaborative pooled analysis to examine levels of TMAO and a few related metabolites across populations and their associations with dietary intakes and established CVD biomarkers.

"Hotspotting Cardiometabolic Disparities for Simulated Advances in Population Care Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health problem, particularly for patients and neighborhoods with low socioeconomic status. Growing evidence has encouraged health systems to explore the use of community health workers (CHWs) to improve screening and management of CVD and cardiometabolic risks (CMR) among patients and communities with disparate disease burden. Yet broad systems change has been limited by a lack of outcome and cost data of sufficient scope and duration. We propose using innovative systems-science methods to model and analyze the effectiveness and cost of individually-targeted and neighborhood-targeted CHW interventions to reduce CVD disparities. The results will provide sought-after guidance for health systems implementation of optimally targeted programs to improve population health disparities. Public health in general will benefit significantly from the creation and validation of a systems-based framework for targeting communities experiencing CVD disparities with coordinated clinic- and community-based CHW programs. By merging spatial hotspot analysis with established microsimulation, this study's innovative methodology will provide novel and actionable knowledge based on simulated large- scale implementation of CHW interventions currently supported by small-scale trial data, yielding a replicable means for health systems and policymakers to identify, model, and improve health disparities in the future. The project has five stages. Stage 1: Data collection, geocoding, and spatial aggregation of de-identified data; Stage 2: identification of geographic hotspots of CVD and spatial statistical analysis to determine factors of neighborhood risk; Stage 3: adaptation of our established microsimulation model to the disease, demographic, and social characteristics of hotspots and to the parameters of CHW interventions; Stage 4: microsimulation modeling of clinic-based CHW interventions targeted to patients with individual and neighborhood CVD risks and community-based CHW programs targeted to neighborhoods according to disparate burdens of CMR and CVD; Stage 5: comparison of the disease outcomes, geographic clustering of CVD, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability for CHW interventions for CMR and CVD along 2-, 10-, and 20-year time frames. We will collect, de-identify, and aggregate service data from the 2 safety-net health care systems serving most patients and high-risk communities in a Midwestern metropolitan area. That data will provide a granular view of the neighborhood distribution of CVD and CMR illness burden across the metropolitan area to allow for robust spatial analysis and microsimulation modeling. Microsimulation analyses informed by empiric data will allow us to compare the effects of targeted clinic- and community-based CHW programs on disparities within communities across the metropolitan area. By melding spatial hotspot analysis with microsimulation in an innovative systems-science approach, this study will provide useful insights into the impact, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of programs to reduce CVD disparities that are currently supported only by pilot data.

"Encouraging Mail Order Pharmacy Use to Improve Outcomes and Reduce Disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adherence to effective cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor medications is associated with improved CVD risk factor control, fewer hospitalizations, and lower mortality in patients with diabetes. However, many patients are poorly adherent to medications, and there are persistent racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in medication adherence. Traditional clinical trials of interventions to improve medication adherence are often resource-intensive, and focus exclusively on patient-level barriers to behavior change. Unsurprisingly, these trials have not led to sustainable, cost-effective approaches to improve adherence. Health system-level medication adherence interventions that can be implemented, ""scaled up,"" and sustained across a wide range of health care delivery settings are urgently needed. Delivering efficacious prescription drugs through existing mail order pharmacies can be considered a system-level approach to enhancing access to medications. Previous research using observational data has shown that mail order pharmacy use is associated with improved adherence to CVD risk factor medications, and with improved CVD risk factor control. Despite this evidence, and although mail order pharmacy use is potentially cost-saving to both patients and health plans, fewer than 25% of patients with diabetes use the mail order pharmacy to obtain their diabetes medications. Mail order pharmacy use is even lower among non- whites and patients with lower socioeconomic status. We propose a randomized encouragement trial to encourage use of existing mail order pharmacy services among diabetes patients with poor adherence to CVD risk factor medications and who only use retail pharmacies in 3 health care systems: Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Harvard Pilgrim, and Kaiser Permanente Hawaii. These combined systems include approximately 300,000 patients with diabetes with diverse racial/ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds. Patients with no history of mail order pharmacy use will be randomized into 3 arms: 1) a standardized intervention to encourage mail order use and provide easily accessible information on how to access the service; 2) a personalized intervention that includes components of the standardized intervention as well as additional information tailored to patient-specific characteristics such as prescription regimens and individualized potential savings by switching to the mail order pharmacy; and 3) usual care. In addition to examining the impact of the intervention on medication adherence and CVD risk factor control, we will examine factors affecting the sustainability and dissemination of the intervention, assess the intervention's impact on utilization and health care costs, and determine whether the intervention's impact differs across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups. This research will provide a foundation for developing sustainable, system-level approaches to addressing medication adherence in diabetes patients that can be widely disseminated and implemented across a diverse array of health care systems. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The purpose of this application is to test whether standardized and personalized outreach strategies to encourage mail order pharmacy use in diabetes patients at high risk for poor cardiovascular disease outcomes will result in greater medication adherence and improved cardiovascular disease risk factor control. We will assess differences in the impact of the intervention across racial/ethnic and socioeconomic subgroups, and evaluate the barriers and facilitators to sustaining and disseminating the intervention.

"CV Wizard: Does a Prioritized, Point-of-Care Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Guideline-Based CVD Risk Factor Control in Safety Net Clinics? PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Substantial progress in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality would be achieved if evidence-based guidelines for CVD risk factor control were implemented consistently in primary care settings. Electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems that identify uncontrolled CVD risk factors and provide individualized care recommendations improved rates of guideline-concordant CVD care in large, integrated healthcare settings, but little is known about how effective such CDS may be in safety net community health centers (CHCs). CHCs' socioeconomically vulnerable patients have far worse CVD risk factor control and higher rates of major CVD events than the general population. Implementing CDS that leads to improved CVD risk factor control in CHCs could reduce national disparities in CVD outcomes, but CHCs rarely have the resources to develop sophisticated CDS, and very few currently have such systems for CVD care. The proposed study is designed to address this. We will randomize 60 CHCs with a shared EHR to immediate vs. delayed implementation of a sophisticated CDS system that provides point-of-care CVD care recommendations to the primary care provider and the patient, and has been proven highly successful in large, integrated care settings. Before implementing the CDS, we will ask CHC patients and providers about the particular patient needs and perspectives and clinic workflows likely to influence adoption and impact of the CDS in CHCs. This input will inform development of CHC care team training strategies, and adaptation of the patient-facing aspects of the CDS system. We will measure adoption of the CDS, and impact of its use over time on CVD risk scores and risk factor control (blood pressure, HbA1c, lipid levels; aspirin use; smoking; body mass index) in high-CVD risk CHC patients. We will also conduct a mixed methods process evaluation, to identify facilitators and barriers to use of the CDS, and to iteratively develop and test strategies for supporting its adoption and ongoing use in CHC workflows. We anticipate that this intervention could (a) improve CVD care among low-income CHC patients, (b) reduce CVD care disparities between CHC populations and national rates, and (c) facilitate greater CHC patient engagement in CVD treatment decision-making and prioritization. The proposed work directly responds to PAR 15-279 goals: it addresses gaps in guideline- based care in high-risk populations with targeted, innovative, multi-level strategies; considers setting-specific needs; and supports patient engagement. Our team's research experience and established partnerships with key healthcare system stakeholders increase the likelihood of project success. Results will yield EHR- agnostic CDS tools for use by any CHC with an implementation guide, build knowledge about how to minimize disparities in CVD care and outcomes using scalable CDS strategies, and help translate investments in informatics into clinical benefit for millions of high-risk, low-income Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project aims to reduce disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control and in rates of heart attacks and strokes among the low-income, racially / ethnically diverse Americans who receive primary care at safety net community health centers (CHCs). To achieve this important objective, we will adapt a successful clinical decision support (CDS) system currently used in CVD care at several large, integrated health care systems, to meet the patient needs and workflow processes of 60 CHCs. We will determine if use of this CDS improves CVD care, reduces disparities in CVD care and outcomes, and increases patient engagement in CVD treatment choices, in CHCs. Results of this randomized trial will help accelerate the translation of major investments in health informatics systems into substantial clinical benefits for large numbers of high-risk, low-income patients. Results will also provide a template for CVD care improvement that can be spread to other CHCs and extended to other clinical conditions.","CV Wizard: Does a Prioritized, Point-of-Care Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Guideline-Based CVD Risk Factor Control in Safety Net Clinics?",9437837,R01HL133793,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Community Developments ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Decision Making ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Online Systems ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk Management ', ' Hospital Risk Reporting ', ' Smoking ', ' Stroke ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' Integrated Delivery of Health Care ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Body mass index ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' public health priorities ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' personalized care ', ' Patient risk ', ' support tools ', ' treatment choice ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' clinical decision support ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2018,907642,0.29304808153068373
"Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of women in the United States and African-American women have strikingly high rates of CVD-related death and disability compared to White women. These stark racial disparities have persisted for decades, have increased among young to middle-aged women, and are not explained by traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic status. Racism-related stressors have been proposed as one potential pathway through which “race” impacts cardiovascular health; but most studies have focused on interpersonal experiences of racism, which may actually underestimate the impact of racism- related psychosocial stress on CVD. The proposed research is designed to determine whether a novel, racism-related stressor –“expectations of racism” --is a risk factor for early CVD in African-American women. We have compelling cross-sectional preliminary data demonstrating that among African-American women, “expectations” of racism are associated with measurable indices of CVD; independent of actual experiences of racism, and other forms of psychosocial stress. This proposal builds upon this prior work by using innovative methodologies from public health and psychology to determine whether, in what contexts, and how this unique psychosocial stressor contributes to CVD risk in African-American women over time. We will examine expectations of racism and increases in early CVD risk over a 2-year follow up in a community sample of 400 healthy African-American women aged 30-45. Early CVD risk will be assessed via changes in carotid intima media thickening (IMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, and 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), a measure of autonomic physiologic arousal and a potential mechanism linking expectations of racism to IMT. Additionally, because research suggests that expectations of racism are largely influenced by context, we will examine whether associations are more pronounced among women with high (vs. low) levels of exposure to interracial contact (assessed via novel measures of “activity spaces” that can determine the average percentage of time spent in integrated vs. segregated environments). Finally, in order to determine how high levels of expected racism contribute to physiological responses and psychological distress on a day-to-day basis, we will conduct a daily diary study in a subsample of women, to examine daily ABP reactivity to interpersonal stressors, as well as day-to-day affect. Secondary aims will examine additional psychosocial stressors and cultural resources as potential moderators, and rumination, negative affect and social disconnectedness as potential mediators. Findings from this study will ultimately be used to develop psychosocial interventions to help African-American women at risk for CVD cope with the threat of expected racism. PROJECT NARRATIVE The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether a novel, racism-related psychosocial stressor is a unique risk factor for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) in young to middle-aged African-American women. Recent research suggests that African-American women aged 35-44 have rates of CVD that are higher than those of African-American men, White men, and White women. These disparities are not due to obesity or other traditional CVD risk factors and are likely to increase over time. Identifying the determinants of early CVD in African-American women will be key to designing preventive interventions for this understudied, at risk group, and ultimately reducing their excess burden of disease.",Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women,9709704,R01HL130471,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' indexing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Moods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Friendships ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Health Psychology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intima media ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' clinical risk ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' racial identity ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,371280,0.22470485403398358
"Healthcare Fragmentation and Cardiovascular Outcomes The number of cancer survivors is expected to grow by 25% over the next decade. Among individuals who survive 5+ years from diagnosis, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the #1 cause of death. Previous work suggests that cancer survivors are less likely to receive non-cancer preventive care (e.g., flu vaccines, cholesterol screening) than patients who have not had cancer. Thus, it is also possible that cancer survivors receive less attention to CVD risk management. Little is known about this important issue outside of cancer registries and clinical trials, which may have limited generalizability to usual care and racial minorities (who are often underrepresented). Reducing CVD events among cancer survivors –especially racial minorities –is an emerging national priority. The goal of this proposal is to understand how patterns of healthcare (including fragmentation of care across multiple providers) and provider specialty affect CVD outcomes for cancer survivors. The specific aims are to determine associations between healthcare fragmentation, provider specialty, CVD risk management, and CVD outcomes among cancer survivors. The proposed project would be a Diversity Supplement to an existing R01 grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (“Healthcare fragmentation and cardiovascular outcomes”). The existing R01 grant currently considers patients broadly and does not focus on the subgroup of patients who are cancer survivors. Both the parent study and the proposed Supplement are ancillary studies to the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, an ongoing, NIH-funded, prospective cohort study that began in 2003. Robust epidemiologic data from REGARDS have been linked to Medicare claims for 9,000+ community-dwelling participants aged 65+ years. Healthcare fragmentation will be measured from existing Medicare claims and from newly collected surveys (collected by the parent study) on self-reported experiences with care coordination and fragmentation. Provider specialty will be determined from existing Medicare claims. If awarded, this Diversity Supplement will generate evidence to inform the design of interventions to decrease healthcare fragmentation and prevent CVD outcomes for cancer survivors and advance a career at the intersection of cancer care and cardiovascular care. Among individuals who survive a cancer diagnosis by 5+ years, the most common cause of death is cardiovascular disease, rather than recurrent cancer. Cancer survivors see many different providers, and it is possible that management of their cardiovascular risk factors is not prioritized or well-coordinated. The goals of this Diversity Supplement are to determine the relationship between healthcare fragmentation, provider specialty, and cardiovascular outcomes among cancer survivors and, in the process, to advance a career at the intersection of oncology care and cardiovascular care.",Healthcare Fragmentation and Cardiovascular Outcomes,9706393,R01HL135199,"['Affect ', ' Ambulatory Care ', '

"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist. Project Narrative The overarching objective of this K01 career development award is to foster the transition of Dr. Azizi Seixas into an independent scientist in the area of sleep and cardiovascular disease and health disparities. The proposed study will investigate a novel mechanism underlying associations between insufficient sleep, obesity, and disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Findings from the study will be the basis of sleep and obesity interventions to reduce CVD risk, especially among diverse groups burdened by cardiovascular disease.",The effect of insufficient sleep

"Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of women in the United States and African-American women have strikingly high rates of CVD-related death and disability compared to White women. These stark racial disparities have persisted for decades, have increased among young to middle-aged women, and are not explained by traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic status (SES). Racism-related stressors have been proposed as one potential pathway through which ""race"" impacts cardiovascular health; but most studies have focused on interpersonal experiences of racism, which may actually underestimate the impact of racism- related psychosocial stress on CVD. The proposed research is designed to determine whether a novel, racism-related stressor -""expectations of racism"" --is a risk factor for early CVD in African-American women. We have compelling cross-sectional preliminary data demonstrating that among African-American women, ""expectations"" of racism are associated with measurable indices of CVD; independent of actual experiences of racism, and other forms of psychosocial stress. This application builds upon this prior work by using innovative methodologies from public health and psychology to determine whether, in what contexts, and how this unique psychosocial stressor contributes to CVD risk in African-American women over time. We will examine expectations of racism and increases in early CVD risk over a 2-year follow up in a community sample of 400 healthy African-American women aged 30-45. Early CVD risk will be assessed via changes in carotid intima media thickening (CIMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, and 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), a measure of autonomic physiologic arousal and a potential mechanism linking expectations of racism to IMT. Additionally, because research suggests that expectations of racism are largely influenced by context, we will examine whether associations are more pronounced among women with high (vs. low) levels of exposure to interracial contact (assessed via novel measures of ""activity spaces"" that can determine the average percentage of time spent in integrated vs. segregated environments). Finally, in order to determine how high levels of expected racism contribute to physiological responses and psychological distress on a day-to-day basis, we will conduct a daily diary study in a subsample of women, to examine daily ABP reactivity to interpersonal stressors, as well as day-to-day affect. Secondary aims will examine additional psychosocial stressors and cultural resources as potential moderators, and rumination, negative affect and social disconnectedness as potential mediators. Findings from this study will ultimately be used to develop psychosocial interventions to help African-American women at risk for CVD cope with the threat of expected racism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether a novel, racism-related psychosocial stressor is a unique risk factor for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) in young to middle-aged African-American women. Recent research suggests that African-American women aged 35-44 have rates of CVD that are higher than those of African-American men, White men, and White women. These disparities are not due to obesity or other traditional CVD risk factors and are likely to increase over time. Identifying the determinants of early CVD in African-American women will be key to designing preventive interventions for this understudied, at risk group, and ultimately reducing their excess burden of disease.",Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women,9405607,R01HL130471,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' Hypertension ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' indexing ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' Moods ', ' Obesity ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' Mediating ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Friendships ', ' Area ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Health Psychology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' follow-up ', ' feelings ', ' Feeling ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intima media ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical risk ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' racial disparity ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' racial identity ', ' negative affectivity ', ' negative affect ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2018,833092,0.22552220101449566
"Rural Intervention for Caregivers' Heart Health (RICHH) ABSTRACT  In the patient-family caregiver dyad, emphasis traditionally has been on the patient or on helping the caregiver take care of the patient. This approach ignores the health of the caregiver. Family caregivers of patients with chronic disease are at uniquely high risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because of the environment they share with the patient, lack of time for personal care due to caregiving demands, and persistent psychological distress, caregivers of patients with chronic illness have substantially higher risk for CVD than non-caregivers. To reduce this risk, cardiovascular health interventions aimed at (1) CVD risk reduction (2) improving adherence to self-management of CVD risk reducing behaviors, and (3) preventing and managing depressive symptoms are required. Rural caregivers are particularly at risk for poor health. Most rural areas are characterized by marked health disparities, including elevated CVD risk, persistent poverty, and lack of social and healthcare resources. As such, innovative intervention programs are needed to improve cardiovascular health among rural caregivers while overcoming personal and environmental barriers to achieving this goal.  The Rural Intervention for Caregivers’ Heart Health (RICHH) program proposed in this study will address the important components of CVD risk reduction for rural caregivers of patients with chronic illness – most notably improved self-management of CVD risk reduction efforts, including prevention and management of depressive symptoms. We propose an innovative delivery modality designed to overcome environmental barriers in socioeconomically austere rural areas. The purpose of the proposed 2-group (RICHH vs control) randomized clinical trial is to examine short- and long-term effects of the RICHH intervention on CVD risk (i.e., lipid profile, body mass index, and blood pressure), self-care behaviors (i.e., diet quality, physical activity level, self-reported adherence to health behaviors), and depressive symptoms, compared to usual care control in rural caregivers of persons with chronic disease. A total of 280 caregivers of patients with chronic illness will be enrolled. Rural caregivers will be randomly assigned to either the RICHH intervention group or a usual care control group. We will stratify caregivers by gender in order to examine the moderating effect of gender on intervention outcomes, given the many differences between male and female caregivers. The RICHH intervention (6 interactive modules) will be delivered for 12 weekly sessions (30- to 45 minutes per session). In order to enhance maintenance of behaviors, we will also deliver 8 biweekly (every other week) booster sessions (20-30 minutes per sessions) for 2 months and then 6 monthly sessions. All sessions are delivered individually using a video-conferencing program on a multimedia digital device (i.e., mini iPad). Data on outcomes will be collected at baseline, 4 months and 12 months. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Rural caregivers of individuals with chronic illness are at uniquely high risk for development of heart disease. We propose to test the Rural Intervention for Caregivers’ Heart Health program, an innovative self- management program designed to lower heart disease and depression risk, and overcome environmental and personal barriers to self-management. This innovative intervention program will improve physical and psychological health for rural caregivers of chronically ill patients in rural Kentucky.",Rural Intervention for Caregivers' Heart Health

"STATISTICAL METHODS FOR GENOMIC DISSECTION OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Statistical Methods for Genomic Dissection of Cardiovascular Diseases Abstract This mentored career development grant application proposes a training program to integrate Dr. Sung's previous research in statistical genetics into cardiovascular disease (CVD). Her long-term career goal is to establish herself as an independent statistician in CVD genetics research so that she can more effectively participate in multi-disciplinary research programs with clinical and translational CVD researchers and be better equipped to develop and apply statistical methods to contribute more meaningfully to the field of CVD genetics. This will be achieved through building a strong foundation in the clinical and research aspects of CVD and enhancing her understanding of genomics and whole-genome sequence data. Dr. Sung's mentoring team consists of multi-disciplinary researchers with a strong research track record. Complex cardiometabolic traits including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes contribute to CVD, the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the industrialized world. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have led to many exciting discoveries. However, most GWAS discoveries have not been translated to clinical care because the functional mechanisms underlying the genetic associations remain elusive and the roles played by the environment in modulating these associations remain poorly defined. The research objective of this K25 application is to decipher the genetic and environmental architecture of cardiometabolic traits by incorporating GxE interactions and regulatory annotation information. We hypothesize that joint analysis of the environment, regulatory variants and coding variants will enhance the discovery of putative genetic variants and the functional mechanisms underlying cardiometabolic traits. To evaluate this hypothesis, we aim to identify genetic variants involving GxE interactions and identify putative functional variants by incorporating ENCODE regulation information.

"Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K24 renewal is for Dr. Corbie-Smith to establish a premier research infrastructure to provide exceptional training for the next generation of CVD researchers who address the health and healthcare of patients who bear a disproportionate burden of CVD morbidity and mortality. Dr. Corbie-Smith has made excellent use of the support provided in the first cycle of her K24. She has been highly productive, with an impressive trajectory of peer-reviewed publications in the emerging field of community engaged research. She has been successful in funding her work, obtaining a new R01 grant focused on dissemination of an evidence based intervention to reduce CVD risk in rural African American populations. She has mentored her first trainees to independence, and new trainees she has mentored with her K24 support have been successful in terms of publications and funding. She has successfully mentored trainees in diverse fields such as nursing, medicine, health behavior, and epidemiology and the vast majority of trainees are scholars of color. This renewal will make it possible for the candidate to further develop her research program, and use her research program as a platform for her mentoring. She will leverage her ongoing R01, the Center for Health Equity Research, the Sheps Center for Health Services Research and NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, as a resource for her mentees. Bringing together the extensive career development resources of the Center for Health Equity Research, Sheps and NC Translational and Clinical Science Institute with the mentoring resources of the K24 gives the candidate a unique opportunity to develop exceptional mentoring to improve CVD outcomes. The proposed aims are to: (1) engage community members to define, map and programs. Finally, she will use the K24 to develop an innovative new research direction, examining the association between organizational networks in rural AA communities and sustainability of CVD interventions assess CVD risk reduction assets available in rural settings; (2) use mixed methods to understand the factors (communication, cooperation, and competition) that influence collaboration among organizations with CVD risk reduction programming; (3) conduct network analysis to understand how organizational networks change over time in rural communities among organizations conducting CVD risk reduction programming; and (4) examine the association between organizational networks and a) sustainability of CVD risk reduction interventions and b) CVD outcomes among participants in those interventions. The candidate will also continue a formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become successful leaders in CVD disparities research. Each mentee will have a focused career development plan that includes directed didactic and developmental activities and a mentored research project that will lead to first author publications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors are dramatic in rural and minority communities with limited access to quality healthcare. In this proposal, we will define assets that already exist in communities to reduce CVD risk and examine how organizational assets and networks evolve and are associated with sustainability of interventions to reduce population CVD risk. Combined with the mentoring component, to train new and early stage researchers to conduct high impact CVD prevention research, the proposed research is highly relevant to NHLBI's mission to enhance the health of patients so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.",Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities,9468417,K24HL105493,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' alcohol consumed ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Dairy Products ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services Research ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Institutes ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' health care quality ', ' healthcare quality ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Environment ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Research Methods ', ' Rural Community ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' salt intake ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Resource Development ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' community based participatory research ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' health equity ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' mobile computing ', ' minority communities ', ' rural African American ', ' rural setting ', ' recruit ', ' service programs ', ' outreach services ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K24,2018,115554,0.2611619605479507
"Childhood Obesity and Cardiovascular Disease Risk: An Intergenerational Approach DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for more than one-third of all U.S. deaths and a major source of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic health disparities. Rising child and adolescent obesity rates threaten to erase the prior success of CVD prevention efforts. Without significant improvements in prevention, CVD prevalence is likely to increase by 10%, and related healthcare costs are likely to triple by 2030. Obesity and hypertension are major contributors to CVD risk and major sources of racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities over the life course. Low-income African Americans are particularly vulnerable. Despite the availability of: 1) behavioral interventions addressing diet and physical activity as mainstays of obesity and CVD risk reduction, and 2) research evidence suggesting that family-level interventions may be important for eliminating child and adolescent CVD and obesity disparities; most adult CVD risk reduction interventions do not consider family- level effects. The goal of the proposed research is to develop an innovative and effective family-level intervention targeting adolescent family members of African-American (AA) adults at high-risk for CVD. This research will: 1) identify mechanisms by which an individual-level CVD risk reduction intervention can produce family-level effects, 2) yield an innovative family-level intervention that is likely to reduce adolescent CVD and obesity risk among high-risk AA youth, and 3) generate valuable pilot data for a future R01 proposal to inform refinement and evaluation of the family-level intervention developed via this proposal. This research is a critica step in developing effective and innovative family-level interventions with significant positive impacts on CVD and obesity disparities among high-risk adolescents. It also represents a critical next step in the scholarly development of the candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award (K23). The candidate for this K23, Dr. Rachel J. Thornton, is a general pediatrician and Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Her long-term career goal is to become an independently funded patient-oriented researcher studying development, implementation, evaluation, and dissemination of multilevel interventions to eliminate racial/ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in child and adolescent CVD and obesity risk. During the award, Dr. Thornton will complete a rigorous program of training, including advanced coursework and practical research. Her proposed activities will occur within the rich training environment of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and Johns Hopkins University including the Center to Eliminate Cardiovascular Disparities and the Johns Hopkins Global Center on Childhood Obesity.

"Thrombosis genetics in African Americans ABSTRACT Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States, and disproportionate rates are seen in minority African American populations. Thrombosis and vascular inflammation are important contributors to atherosclerotic plaque rupture and vascular occlusion that underlie myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, as well as venous thromboembolic disease. The identification of novel biomarkers and their assessment in different ethnic populations can augment the information obtained from traditional CVD risk factors as well as illuminate underlying disease mechanisms and health disparities. While blood biomarkers have been shown to be critically important in the study of CVD, there is a deficit of studies of these measures in African American populations. Preliminary data suggest that thrombin generation, as quantified ex vivo by plasma measurement of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) is a novel approach to understanding the connection of both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways to thrombus formation in vivo. Whole genome sequence (WGS) data, including both coding and functional noncoding variants, are required to identify the full spectrum of contributions of rare variants to common diseases. WGS data are particularly important among non-European ancestry groups, where there is still relatively limited genomic information. Using stored baseline Jackson Heart Study (JHS) plasma samples from 3,500 African Americans, we propose to measure several emerging thrombosis and inflammation plasma biomarkers (endogenous thrombin potential, fibrinogen gamma', coagulation factors VIII and VIIa, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, soluble CD14, and soluble CD163) that are likely to reflect and/or account for increased thrombogenicity and therefore may contribute to higher rates of CVD in African Americans. We will assess the association of thrombosis biomarkers and biomarker-associated genetic variants with more complex subclinical and clinical CVD endpoints available in JHS and other African American cohorts, including REGARDS. By adding these key measures of thrombosis and inflammation to the JHS and REGARDS data sets, utilizing existing whole genome sequence data available through the NHLBI TOPMed project, and using innovative analytical and population genetic approaches, we will be able to greatly expand our knowledge of the role of thrombosis and inflammation in CVD health disparities. Project Narrative This project will measure thrombosis and inflammation biomarkers in approximately 4,500 African Americans from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Using available genome-wide sequence data through the NHLBI TOPMed project, we will investigate the relationship between genetic and environmental factors, thrombosis and inflammation biomarkers and cardiovascular disease in African Americans. Association findings will be validated in additional data sets of African Americans available through dbGaP and various GWAS consortia and collaborative networks.",Thrombosis genetics in African

"Comparative Assessment of Modifying Social Determinants to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Burden and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite advancements in prevention and treatments for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), fiscal constraints have driven federal and state policymakers to make difficult choices among competing policy decisions, often without evidence of effectiveness. A comparative effectiveness approach, or in the absence of experimental data, a comparative assessment approach that compares the estimated impacts of modifying exposures using observational data, can critically inform this priority-setting process. We and others have demonstrated that social determinants, upstream social factors such as income inequality and social capital/cohesion, are key predictors of disease including CVD. Yet important questions remain about which social determinants have the biggest impacts on CVD burden. Furthermore, we lack knowledge on which subpopulations and states are most affected. In spite of calls for comparative assessments/effectiveness of strategies to improve population health and prevent CVD, including from NIH, we still lack knowledge on the relative CVD burden and economic impacts associated with modifying such factors. Given this information, there are critical needs to accurately estimate the impacts of social determinants on CVD risks; to translate these estimates into policy- setting tools including impacts on CVD burden and costs; and to compare and contrast the costs and sizes of these impacts. Our overall objective is to provide the first comparative assessment evidence base to compare the CVD burden and economic impacts of modifying key social determinants in middle-aged and older Americans. We will accomplish our overall objective by pursuing the following specific aims using data from two large, nationally-representative samples of middle-aged and older adults, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths 1979 (NLSY) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), linked to social and economic measures by area of residence, and to Medicare claims and mortality databases: Aim #1) To determine which social determinants most strongly predict the risks of CVD incidence, mortality, and risk factors in middle-aged and older adults; Aim #2) To identify which subpopulations and geographic states are most vulnerable to the influences of social determinants on CVD burden and risk factors; and Aim #3) To determine which social determinants if modified are expected to yield the greatest reductions in CVD burden and its associated costs, both overall and by subpopulation. Regarding outcomes, our 3- year study is expected to identify the most promising social determinants on which to intervene to yield improvements in adult CVD burden. We will further establish how vulnerabilities to effects by geography and subpopulations may explain CVD disparities. By translating our estimates into population health and economic measures, we will directly respond to calls for comparative assessments and economic evaluations in CVD prevention research. Over the long term, we expect that our project will have high translational impact through guiding policymakers' evidence-based decisions to reduce CVD burden and inequities.

"Project Title: PROSPECT: Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic Disease Trends PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite efforts to prevent chronic diseases, they continue to increase, with underserved ethnic minorities bearing the greatest burden. The United States (US) territory of Puerto Rico (PR) has high prevalence of multiple cardiometabolic conditions that increase risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence supports a direct link between psychosocial and food-related environmental risk factors, and cardiometabolic conditions, but these remain markedly understudied at the island-wide population level in PR, despite the clear and pressing need to alleviate the burden of chronic disease in the island. On September 2017, hurricane Maria devastated PR, imposing urgency for studying trends and associations of risk factors for cardiometabolic conditions under times of distress. Thus, the overall goal for this application is to identify trends and longitudinal associations in psychosocial, food-related, and cardiometabolic risk factors that can guide public health priorities and future research needs aimed at reducing CVD-related disparities in PR. To this end, we will establish `PROSPECT: Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic disease Trends', an island-wide, longitudinal population cohort of 2,000 adults (30-75y) in PR recruited with a multi-frame sampling of probabilistic plus community approaches, and assessed in a network of several partner clinics across the island. The study will collect comprehensive data on multiple psychosocial, dietary, and food-related factors, CVD biological markers, and medical record data, with follow-up at 2-years, and will assess variations by urban-rural area and by timing before-after Maria. PROSPECT builds upon the feasibility and resources established by a 2015 pilot study in PR, and emulates the goals and methods of US and Caribbean cohorts inclusive of mainland Puerto Ricans and other Latinos for comparison.  Our specific aims are to: (1) estimate baseline and 2y prevalence of psychosocial, diet and food-related environment, and biological CVD risk factors, (2) determine longitudinal associations between 2y changes in psychosocial factors and biological CVD risk factors, (3) determine longitudinal associations between 2y changes in diet and food-related factors, and biological CVD risk factors, and (4) estimate differences in prevalence and 2y changes in risk factors by urban vs. rural area, and pre vs. post-Maria.  PROSPECT will identify priorities for addressing CVD risk factors, and will let us plan and implement tailored public health programs and interventions to effectively improve cardiometabolic health in a high-risk, underserved group. The project will enhance collaborative health research, leadership, and capacity in PR, and has high potential for sustainability by using existing infrastructure, and for comparability with US cohorts. Our new island-wide probabilistic comprehensive longitudinal study will bridge a gap in knowledge in PR, create a biorepository and participant database for future use, yield seminal data to support tailored translation into programs and policy, and compellingly reduce disparities in cardiometabolic health in PR. NARRATIVE Cardiometabolic conditions, and the psychosocial and food-related (e.g. diet) factors that may influence them, have not been properly studied in Puerto Rico (PR), despite high prevalence of chronic disease in this US territory. This is important to understand after hurricane Maria. Our goal is to build a longitudinal island-wide population cohort of adults in PR (`PROSPECT') with comprehensive data on risk factors and cardiovascular biomarkers, in order to enhance collaborative health research, leadership, and capacity in PR, create a biorepository and participant database, and yield seminal data on trends that can guide tailored public health programs and policy and future

"CVD in American Indians Genetics Center DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Strong Heart Study (SHS) of two unique American Indian (AI) cohorts (4549 adults, aged 45 to 74 and 3838 �15 yrs. from 94 families) constitutes an unequalled and irreplaceable national resource. The proposed studies will elucidate the genetics and early pathophysiology of diabetic CVD and also address health disparities experienced by populations with high rates of diabetes and CVD. Very high rates of obesity and diabetes, especially among younger SHS participants, herald a pending epidemic of CVD, making them the ideal population in which to examine these processes. Measures of CVD, preclinical CVD, biomarkers, and genetic findings have provided valuable pathogenetic insights related to the etiology of CVD; the proposed investigations will take maximal advantage of this solid foundation and add innovative new measures. Our Aims: The identification of genetic variants affecting risk of obesity, diabetes, preclinical CVD, and CVD events, aided by new genomic technologies. We will use genomics techniques for SNP discovery and subsequent statistical analysis of functionality in regions known to contain genes of interest. Transcriptional profiling of RNA concurrent with a liver/abdominal MRI will be used to relate expression of genes and gene networks to CVD etiology. New biological measurements during a re-examination of the large family-based cohort will expand knowledge of pre-clinical stages of obesity and diabetes associated CVD. Novel phenotypes defined by MRI of the abdomen (for fat deposition in liver and adipose depots) will elucidate the etiology of preclinical disease in younger persons. Measures of central blood pressure (by applanation tonometry), heart rate variability and abdominal aortic size will broaden our understanding of CVD in association with obesity and diabetes. Measures of physiologic and behavioral risk factors, such as demographics, reproductive history, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, alcohol, diet, mental health indicators, and physical activity (by accelerometer) will add additional key phenotypes. Continuing mortality and morbidity surveillance of these cohorts will provide increased power in understanding how obesity and diabetes lead to strokes and heart failure in later life. Secular trends, life expectancy, the effects of renal disease on preclinical CVD, and the role of preclinical measures in predicting CVD endpoints will be explored. Thus, the proposed investigations will lead to new understanding of CVD and preclinical and diabetic CVD as well as improvements in clinical practice.

"Extending a Caribbean Based Cohort to Promote US-Caribbean Comparisons to Facilitate Research Addressing Black Health Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fifty percent of Non-Hispanic Black immigrants in the United States (US) originate from the Caribbean. Thus the health of US and Caribbean populations are closely intertwined due to both regional proximity and the high volume of Caribbean immigration to the US3. US and Caribbean Blacks also share disease burden; cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) account for their greatest health disparities-- killing more Black individuals in the US and the Caribbean than any other ethnic/racial group. Yet, there is a paucity of cancer and CVD comparative research between the US-born Black American and African-Caribbean sub-groups. While the NIH has invested in studying US minority/immigrant populations, comparisons with Caribbean cohorts are needed to untangle the effect of biological, environmental, behavioral, and cultural health care system determinants of CVD and cancer risk and outcomes. In partnership with the University of the West Indies (UWI), the African Caribbean Cancer Consortium (AC3) is already making headway into expanding an existing population-based cohort for cancer and CVD research in Jamaica. The Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey (JHLS-III), conducted in 2016-17, is a national representative sample of over 3000 persons. The JHLS-III collected bio-specimens and epidemiological data on CVD, cancer, other chronic diseases and their risk factors, and medical history. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other nationally representative population-based cohorts in the Caribbean specifically targeting cancer combined with other chronic diseases. With an NCI-P20 award, the AC3, an NCI-Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program supported consortium at Fox Chase Cancer Center and UWI have established a Caribbean Regional Center of Research Excellence in Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer. This proposal will be a natural extension of this project by expanding the JHLS-III and building the data mining, storage and analytics infrastructure needed to harness and share data from epidemiological measures and biospecimens to promote comparative research in cancer and cardiometabolic disease. This proposed infrastructure building project will harness and prepare multi-level data for future US-Caribbean comparative studies. We propose to optimize enrollment and retention of Caribbean nationals in cohort studies by (a) obtaining multi-stakeholder input and feedback from community health nurses/field workers and JHLS-III 2016/17 cohort participants to refine targeted enrollment and retention strategies; and (b) evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy relative to historical enrollment and retention rates. We will repurpose and expand the JHLS-III into a robust longitudinal cohort of 8,000 participants, collect and store biospecimens, socioecological and health status data in order to answer questions about NCD (i.e. cancer and CVD) risk and outcomes. We will establish a secure data integration and sharing platform that will enable linkages of the Jamaica cohort with the CAP3 study and other Caribbean and US-based cohorts, and conduct preliminary analytics for data verification and harmonization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the diversity of the US Black population and their disproportionate cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality, comparative studies of African American/immigrant Black populations with Black populations of their native countries must be prioritized to address health disparities in the US. The goal of this proposal is to repurpose and expand an existing Caribbean-based survey into a robust longitudinal cohort that will support US-Caribbean research to facilitate the identification of Black health disparities. This study will produce harmonized data and biospecimen collection methods; subsequently, facilitating an increase in data and biospecimen sharing and comparability with US-based national datasets.",Extending a Caribbean Based Cohort to Promote US-Caribbean Comparisons to Facilitate Research Addressing Black Health Disparities,9772544,R01MD013347,"['Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Community Health Nurse Specialist ', ' Community Health Nurse ', ' Clinical Specialist in Community Health Nursing ', ' Community Health Nursing ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Data Collection ', ' Delaware ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Feedback ', ' Fieldworker ', ' Field Workers ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immigration ', ' Incidence ', ' Interviewer ', ' Jamaica ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Mouthwash ', ' Persons ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' Urine ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' West Indies ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Caribbean region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' Caribbean ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' instrument ', ' Specimen ', ' Research Specimen ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' NHANES ', ' programs ', ' African Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' black Caribbean ', ' Country ', ' cancer risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' BRFSS ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' COBRE ', ' Collection ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Behavioral ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' data integration ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance study ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' retention rate ', ' student retention ', ' retention strategy ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Jamaican ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2019,662973,0.1628325227927161
"Hotspotting Cardiometabolic Disparities for Simulated Advances in Population Care Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health problem, particularly for patients and neighborhoods with low socioeconomic status. Growing evidence has encouraged health systems to explore the use of community health workers (CHWs) to improve screening and management of CVD and cardiometabolic risks (CMR) among patients and communities with disparate disease burden. Yet broad systems change has been limited by a lack of outcome and cost data of sufficient scope and duration. We propose using innovative systems-science methods to model and analyze the effectiveness and cost of individually-targeted and neighborhood-targeted CHW interventions to reduce CVD disparities. The results will provide sought-after guidance for health systems implementation of optimally targeted programs to improve population health disparities. Public health in general will benefit significantly from the creation and validation of a systems-based framework for targeting communities experiencing CVD disparities with coordinated clinic- and community-based CHW programs. By merging spatial hotspot analysis with established microsimulation, this study's innovative methodology will provide novel and actionable knowledge based on simulated large- scale implementation of CHW interventions currently supported by small-scale trial data, yielding a replicable means for health systems and policymakers to identify, model, and improve health disparities in the future. The project has five stages. Stage 1: Data collection, geocoding, and spatial aggregation of de-identified data; Stage 2: identification of geographic hotspots of CVD and spatial statistical analysis to determine factors of neighborhood risk; Stage 3: adaptation of our established microsimulation model to the disease, demographic, and social characteristics of hotspots and to the parameters of CHW interventions; Stage 4: microsimulation modeling of clinic-based CHW interventions targeted to patients with individual and neighborhood CVD risks and community-based CHW programs targeted to neighborhoods according to disparate burdens of CMR and CVD; Stage 5: comparison of the disease outcomes, geographic clustering of CVD, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability for CHW interventions for CMR and CVD along 2-, 10-, and 20-year time frames. We will collect, de-identify, and aggregate service data from the 2 safety-net health care systems serving most patients and high-risk communities in a Midwestern metropolitan area. That data will provide a granular view of the neighborhood distribution of CVD and CMR illness burden across the metropolitan area to allow for robust spatial analysis and microsimulation modeling. Microsimulation analyses informed by empiric data will allow us to compare the effects of targeted clinic- and community-based CHW programs on disparities within communities across the metropolitan area. By melding spatial hotspot analysis with microsimulation in an innovative systems-science approach, this study will provide useful insights into the impact, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of programs to reduce CVD disparities that are currently supported only by pilot data. Project Narrative This project will provide evidence for health systems change to address community health by (1) using geographic hotspot analysis to identify communities with disparate cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden and neighborhood risk, then (2) populating a detailed microsimulation model with empirical data from those populations, in order to (3) compare the impact of individual and neighborhood targeting of community health worker efforts on CVD outcomes and disparities, cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability over short-, intermediate-, and long-term horizons.",Hotspotting Cardiometabolic Disparities for Simulated Advances in Population Care,9768944,R01AG052533,"['Adoption ', ' Attention ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' community health worker ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Collection ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Hospitals ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Out-patients ', ' Outpatients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' metropolitan ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' disorder risk ', ' disease risk ', ' Human Resources ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' cost ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' screening ', ' Patient risk ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' dynamic system ', ' dynamical system ', ' individual patient ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R01,2019,500646,0.1596444042281499
"Thrombosis genetics in African Americans ABSTRACT Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the United States, and disproportionate rates are seen in minority African American populations. Thrombosis and vascular inflammation are important contributors to atherosclerotic plaque rupture and vascular occlusion that underlie myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, as well as venous thromboembolic disease. The identification of novel biomarkers and their assessment in different ethnic populations can augment the information obtained from traditional CVD risk factors as well as illuminate underlying disease mechanisms and health disparities. While blood biomarkers have been shown to be critically important in the study of CVD, there is a deficit of studies of these measures in African American populations. Preliminary data suggest that thrombin generation, as quantified ex vivo by plasma measurement of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) is a novel approach to understanding the connection of both the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways to thrombus formation in vivo. Whole genome sequence (WGS) data, including both coding and functional noncoding variants, are required to identify the full spectrum of contributions of rare variants to common diseases. WGS data are particularly important among non-European ancestry groups, where there is still relatively limited genomic information. Using stored baseline Jackson Heart Study (JHS) plasma samples from 3,500 African Americans, we propose to measure several emerging thrombosis and inflammation plasma biomarkers (endogenous thrombin potential, fibrinogen gamma', coagulation factors VIII and VIIa, soluble interleukin-2 receptor, soluble CD14, and soluble CD163) that are likely to reflect and/or account for increased thrombogenicity and therefore may contribute to higher rates of CVD in African Americans. We will assess the association of thrombosis biomarkers and biomarker-associated genetic variants with more complex subclinical and clinical CVD endpoints available in JHS and other African American cohorts, including REGARDS. By adding these key measures of thrombosis and inflammation to the JHS and REGARDS data sets, utilizing existing whole genome sequence data available through the NHLBI TOPMed project, and using innovative analytical and population genetic approaches, we will be able to greatly expand our knowledge of the role of thrombosis and inflammation in CVD health disparities. Project Narrative This project will measure thrombosis and inflammation biomarkers in approximately 4,500 African Americans from the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) and Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Using available genome-wide sequence data through the NHLBI TOPMed project, we will investigate the relationship between genetic and environmental factors, thrombosis and inflammation biomarkers and cardiovascular disease in African Americans. Association findings will be validated in additional data sets of African Americans available through dbGaP and various GWAS consortia and collaborative networks.",Thrombosis genetics in African

"Longitudinal Evaluation of Ovarian Aging and Cardiovascular Risk ABSTRACT Despite significant improvements in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the growing aging population suggests CVD will continue to pose a significant public health burden. Women are a special group where microvascular disease is more common and traditional risk factors may not fully identify risk. Women's reproductive history (e.g. menarcheal age, menstrual cycles, infertility, pregnancy, menopause) may pose unique risk and suggests an opportunity for new approaches. We propose a women-centered approach for early identification of women at risk that investigates the unique loss of reproductive function at an age long before other vital systems fail. Despite the importance of this process, little is known about the determinants or correlates of ovarian aging, or the health implications, especially in diverse populations. With reliable bio-markers of the remaining oocyte pool available, we have a unique opportunity to characterize the association between “ovarian age” and the health implications of accelerated oocyte loss. We hypothesize a risk independent of the well-known impact of early menopause and estrogen deficiency. Rather, we propose that common underlying cellular aging mechanisms, first evident in the ovary due to its sensitivity and earlier demise, make the ovary a window on underlying somatic health. Confirming an association between a decline in markers of ovarian age and CVD risk would allow a potentially high-risk population to be identified decades before traditional risk factors develop. The Ovarian Aging (OVA) cohort is the largest and most ethnically diverse, community-based cohort available that can be used to determine the race/ethnic and behavioral determinants of ovarian aging and its association with CVD risk in a young cycling population. To assess the relationship between markers of ovarian age (reflecting past exposures and genetic risk), the rate of ovarian aging (representing current exposures) and CVD risk, we propose to: 1. Determine whether markers of ovarian age/aging are associated with increased CVD risk by testing if ovarian age/aging is independently associated with increased CVD risk, as measured by peripheral endothelial function testing; 2. Determine whether ovarian aging may moderate or mediate established associations between race/ethnicity and/or socio/emotional health and CVD risk by examining whether observed race/ethnic disparities, or effects of socio/emotional health, on CVD risk, may vary by (moderation model) or be partially attributable to (mediation model) ovarian aging; and 3. Determine whether ovarian aging, CVD risk, and the temporal pattern of appearance correlate with markers of cellular aging: telomere length and mtDNA in peripheral leukocytes, oxidative stress (plasma F2α-isoprostanes), and indices of inflammation (C-reactive protein, interleukin- 6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1). Overall Impact: Our novel longitudinal approach to evaluating markers of ovarian and cellular aging as predictors of CVD could lead to a new way to identify women at earlier and/or increased CVD risk and be used to develop new risk-reduction strategies. NARRATIVE Despite significant improvements in prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease (CVD), women are less aware of risks for CVD and the disease is more lethal once diagnosed. The results of this study will provide detailed novel information regarding the potential correlation between ethnicity, behavioral risk factors and markers of cellular aging with ovarian age/aging and CVD risk. We hypothesize ovarian age/aging provides a window onto the general health of women - not via progressive deficiency of estrogen with menopause, but due to common underlying mechanisms first evident in young populations as lower ovarian reserve (follicle number) due to the sensitivity of the ovary.",Longitudinal Evaluation of Ovarian Aging and Cardiovascular Risk,9698247,R01AG053332,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aging ', ' Awareness ', ' C-reactive protein ', ' Proteins, specific or class, C-reactive ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Replicative Senescence ', ' Cellular Senescence ', ' Cellular Aging ', ' Cell Senescence ', ' Cell Aging ', ' Chronology ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' mtDNA ', ' Mitochondrial DNA ', ' Endothelium ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Health ', ' indexing ', ' infertile ', ' fertility loss ', ' fertility cessation ', ' Difficulty conceiving ', ' Cannot achieve a pregnancy ', ' Infertility ', ' Inflammation ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' IL-6 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' HPGF ', ' BSF2 ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' white blood corpuscle ', ' white blood cell ', ' White Cell ', ' White Blood Cells ', ' Marrow leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood leukocyte ', ' Leukocytes ', ' menopausal ', ' Female Change of Life ', ' Menopause ', ' early menopause ', ' Premature Menopause ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Methods ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' Ovocytes ', ' Oocytes ', ' Ovary ', ' Reticuloendothelial System, Serum, Plasma ', ' Plasma Serum ', ' Blood Plasma ', ' Plasma ', ' Gestation ', ' Pregnancy ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Woman ', ' ICAM-1 ', ' CD54 Antigens ', ' Intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ', ' Measures ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' telomere ', ' Mediating ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Ovarian ', ' Peripheral ', ' Area ', ' Reproductive History ', ' Reproductive Issues ', ' Reproductive History Epidemiology ', ' Reproductive Factors ', ' Evaluation ', ' Predisposition ', ' Susceptibility ', ' reproductive function ', ' Oxidative Stress ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Functional disorder ', ' pathophysiology ', ' Physiopathology ', ' Dysfunction ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' psychosocial ', ' cohort ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' Prevention ', ' Appearance ', ' Somatic Cell ', ' reproductive ', ' Early identification ', ' Emotional ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Isoprostanes ', ' F2-Isoprostanes ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Telomere Shortening ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Risk Marker ', ' Process ', ' Cardiac ', ' Behavioral ', ' novel strategies ', ' novel strategy ', ' novel approaches ', ' new approaches ', ' Population ', ' aged ', ' mitochondrial dysfunction ', ' aging population ', ' population aging ', ' aged population ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' Microvascular Dysfunction ', ' small vessel disease ', ' microvascular disease ', ' microvascular complications ', ' ethnic disparity ', ' ethnicity disparity ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Ovarian aging ', ' ovarian reserve ', ' ']",NIA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2019,1503485,0.13300553117534317
"Impact of multilevel risk and resilience factors on cardiovascular health in racially/ethnically diverse men and women Project Summary/Abstract In the US, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death. African Americans (AAs), low- socioeconomic position (SEP) groups, southerners, and Hispanics are impacted disproportionately by CVD. In addition, compared to women, men have earlier onset of CVD and have had higher death rates attributable to CVD. These sex differences and racial/ethnic and SEP disparities are setbacks to achieving national health equity and CVD reduction goals. To reduce differences and disparities in CVD, it is critical to improve cardiovascular (CV) health. A 2015 AHA statement indicated that “the most significant opportunity” to improve CV health and reduce CVD lies in addressing the social determinants of health. Such determinants include psychosocial risks (e.g., racism, discrimination, and low SEP) operating at multiple levels. Emerging research indicates that resilience resources at the individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood levels may protect CV health in the face of multilevel psychosocial risks via indirect effects such as more positive health behaviors and buffering effects of psychosocial risks on physiological functioning. Resilience resources are defined as positive adaptation and display of positive behaviors/outcomes despite adversity. Compared to multilevel psychosocial risks, multilevel resilience resources represent novel and potentially more malleable intervention targets. Despite growing evidence supporting the protective effects of resilience resources on CV outcomes, critical research gaps remain. For example, the majority of resilience research has not been conducted with disparity populations, populations free of CVD, included multilevel psychosocial risks, or tested for differences between sex and racial/ethnic groups. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to examine if multilevel resilience resources are associated with CV outcomes and if multilevel psychosocial risks moderate these relationships. Specifically, longitudinal data on racially/ethnically diverse men and women enrolled in three CV health cohorts (i.e., JHS, MESA, MASALA) will be harmonized to create an integrated dataset. Using the integrated data we aim to: (a) determine whether the most reliable and valid measures of multilevel risk and multilevel resilience resources demonstrate measurement invariance across sex and diverse racial/ethnic groups; (b) determine if multilevel resilience resources are associated with ideal CV health over time and if multilevel psychosocial risks moderate observed relationships; (c) determine if multilevel resilience resources are prospectively associated with incident CVD events over time and if multilevel psychosocial risks moderate observed relationships; and (d) quantify the degree to which hypothetical interventions designed to build multilevel resilience resources reduce racial/ethnic and sex differences in ideal CV health and CVD events overall and by the level of multilevel psychosocial risks. This project responds to the NIH-wide, NHLBI, OBSSR, and AHA calls to fill critical gaps in psychosocial risk, resilience, and CV outcomes research. Project Narrative This innovative project will: (a) determine whether multilevel resilience resources are associated with cardiovascular (CV) outcomes (i.e., ideal CV health and incident CV disease); (b) quantify the impacts of hypothetical multilevel resilience resource building interventions on racial/ethnic disparities and sex differences in CV outcomes; and (c) examine the degree to which the aforementioned relationships/impacts are moderated by multilevel psychosocial risks. This work will be conducted using longitudinal data on racially/ethnically diverse men and women enrolled in three United States-based CV health cohorts (i.e., JHS, MESA, MASALA) that will be harmonized to create an integrated dataset. This project responds to the calls of NIH, OBSSR, NHLBI, and AHA to conduct studies to fill critical gaps in psychosocial risk, resilience, and CV outcomes research.",Impact of multilevel risk and resilience factors on cardiovascular health in racially/ethnically diverse men and women,9767600,R01HL135200,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Buffers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cause of Death ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Literature ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methods ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Probability ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Weather ', ' Weight ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Death Rate ', ' racism ', ' Individual ', ' optimism ', ' postiive attitude ', ' Measurement ', ' Funding ', ' Life ', ' Disease Management ', ' Disorder Management ', ' Event ', ' Techniques ', ' psychosocial ', ' Equation ', ' cohesion ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' novel ', ' Mediation ', ' Negotiation ', ' Negotiating ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Treatment/Psychosocial Effects ', ' Psychosocial Effect ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' South Asian ', ' Characteristics ', ' sex ', ' early onset ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' prospective ', ' protective effect ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' therapy design ', ' treatment design ', ' intervention design ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' health equity ', ' social health determinants ', ' behavioral outcome ', ' behavior outcome ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' racially diverse ', ' Sex Differences ', ' sex-specific differences ', ' sex-related differences ', ' sex-dependent differences ', ' ']",NHLBI,BROWN UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,442727,0.07694561581483401
"Disaggregating Asian American and Pacific Islander Health Data: Multilevel Analysis of Neighborhood Context and Cardiovascular Health using the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality in the US and for Asian Americans and Pacific Islander (AAPIs) adults age 65 and older. The prevalence of CVD has been well documented for non-Hispanic white, African American, and Hispanic populations. However, CVD morbidity and mortality disproportionately impacts AAPIs living in the US and the true magnitude of CVD by specific racial subgroup (e.g. Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander) has not been accurately characterized. The paucity of data on AAPI subgroups has resulted in the inability to precisely estimate CVD incidence and prevalence and develop appropriate clinical guidelines and recommendations for CVD research priorities. Moreover, traditional CVD risk factors (e.g. hypertension, body mass index, and diabetes) are unequally distributed across AAPI subgroups and the relative importance of these CVD risk factors is unclear. Neighborhood context (e.g. median household income, neighborhood deprivation, and rural/urban status) has been identified as an important determinant of health status and underlying factor in health disparities. However, the relationship between neighborhood context and CVD health in AAPI subgroups is not well understood. AAPIs represent more than 40 cultures of origin and 100 different languages and are projected to be the fastest growing racial group in the US by 2050. AAPI older adults will also be the fastest growing group in the US elderly population. Most AAPI older adults are foreign-born and recent immigrants to the US, and typically have low education levels, limited English proficiencies, and high poverty rates. AAPI older adults are a particularly vulnerable population as they face the compounding effects of minority group status and older age. Furthermore, these current issues are exacerbated by the absence of AAPIs in research. The primary objectives of this study are to identify the prevalence and determinants of CVD in AAPI subgroups and determine the associations between neighborhood context and individual health status in AAPI older adults through secondary data analysis of US Census Bureau data and the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (HOS). We propose multilevel regression analysis of the HOS (N=1,017500), a nationally representative survey administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The HOS is a unique dataset that began collecting expanded ethnic and racial data in 2011, including 4 Hispanic-origin and 11 AAPI-origin categories, which allows for disaggregated analysis of AAPI subgroups (44,705 self-reported an AAPI subgroup). The HOS will be linked to geographic-level census data to investigate neighborhood factors that impact individual differences in health status. We expect that the findings will establish a better understanding of the CVD prevalence in AAPI subgroups and the intersections between neighborhood and CVD and race/ethnicity. The proposed research will inform culturally relevant strategies to improve CVD health in high-risk groups, manage CVD risk factors, and reduce CVD morbidity and mortality in diverse older adults. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in the US, and compared to whites, deaths from cardiovascular diseases have not decreased over time for some Asian and Pacific Islander subgroups (e.g. Asian Indian, Chinese, Filipino, Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Other Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander). This research may provide insights on how cardiovascular disease varies between Asian and Pacific Islander older adults and how neighborhoods characteristics influence cardiovascular health status. In addition, investigating the association between neighborhood environments and race may inform culturally relevant strategies to improve CVD health status, manage CVD risk factors, and reduce CVD morbidity and mortality in diverse populations of older adults.",Disaggregating Asian American and Pacific Islander Health Data: Multilevel Analysis of Neighborhood Context and Cardiovascular Health using the Medicare Health Outcomes Survey,9755319,R36AG060132,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Asian Americans ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Censuses ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' facial ', ' faces ', ' Face ', ' Foundations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Household ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Japanese ', ' Japanese Population ', ' Language ', ' Literature ', ' Masks ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Poverty ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Recommendation ', ' Statistical Regression ', ' Regression Diagnostics ', ' Regression Analyses ', ' Regression Analysis ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' Time ', ' United States Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Health Care Financing Administration ', ' Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ', ' oriental ', ' Asians ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' Chinese ', ' Chinese People ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Filipino ', ' Rural ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Immigrant ', ' Koreans ', ' Research Priority ', ' Educational Background ', ' Education Level ', ' human old age (65+) ', ' aged ≥65 ', ' aged 65 and greater ', ' age 65 and older ', ' age 65 and greater ', ' Aged 65 and Over ', ' 65+ years old ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' Self-Report ', ' Categories ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel model ', ' multi-level model ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' Sampling ', ' deprivation ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Subgroup ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Characteristics ', ' Asian Indian ', ' Hindu ', ' beneficiary ', ' comparison group ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' Individual Differences ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' individualized medicine ', ' unique treatment ', ' tailored treatment ', ' tailored therapy ', ' tailored medical treatment ', ' individualized treatment ', ' individualized therapy ', ' individualized patient treatment ', ' customized treatment ', ' customized therapy ', ' health data ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Limited English Proficiency ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' Native Hawaiian ', ' risk prediction model ', ' ']",NIA,OREGON STATE UNIVERSITY,R36,2019,65358,0.13593435391620703
"P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations Project Summary/Abstract The NYU Meyers College of Nursing is uniquely poised to propose a P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations to promote nursing research in metabolic syndrome (MetS) and related multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Guided by a precision health ecological framework, this center aims to (1) promote innovative research on the complexity, relatedness, biodiversity, and impact on individuals and families of MetS and MCC using a precision health ecological perspective, including biomarkers (genetics/genomics), ancestry, community, and environmental factors and the NINR CDE; (2) develop and sustain a research infrastructure to support and accelerate early career scientists in exploring MetS and MCC in diverse individuals and families from a precision health ecological perspective; and (3) facilitate the development of sustainable interdisciplinary collaborative teams dedicated to advancing the science of MCC by obtaining external funding and conducting impactful research. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a set of inter-related health conditions placing individuals at serious risk for T2D and CVD. MetS is a prodromal state that sets the stage for CVD and T2D. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and obesity are common factors that comprise MetS. MetS is present in ~ 35% of adults in the US. A family history of MCC that includes type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and early cardiovascular disease (CVD) greatly increases the chance that an individual will develop MetS. Genetics and environment play a role in chronic conditions; this is particularly true of MetS. Other causes of MetS and associated T2D and CVD risk include genetic susceptibility, family history, low education and socioeconomic status, increased body mass index (BMI), and lifestyle factors, especially sedentary lifestyle/lack of regular physical activity; diet high in refined carbohydrates, sugar, and saturated fat; cigarette smoking; and substance use 1-6. Research that expands our understanding of biomarkers, lifestyle, contextual, and environmental impacts on phenotypic expression of MetS and related MCC among diverse, vulnerable populations is lacking and critically needed. The infrastructure will include 3 Cores-Administrative Core guided by an Executive Committee and an External Advisory Committee; Pilot Administrative Core with Pilot Feasibility Funding and a Scientific Review Committee; Precision Technology Resource Core, and an Enrichment Program. Two pilot projects will address symptom clusters and biomarkers of MetS related to sleep duration and fatigue. The NYU Meyers College of Nursing has faculty investigators and research scientists with programs of biobehavioral research, funded by NIH, CDC, NSF, and foundations ($9.3 million in direct costs), that address risk, management, and intervention for MCC. These researchers will serve as mentors, collaborators, and resources for the Center pilot PIs and their collaborators. The Center will allow for more individualized care and extend nursing science by offering biomarker, genetic/genomic, biobehavioral, lifestyle, and environmental explanations that will inform nursing care for diverse populations with symptoms of MetS. Project Narrative The goal of the NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations is to develop nurse scientists, and interdisciplinary teams dedicated to research that will expand knowledge on metabolic syndrome (MetS) and related multiple chronic conditions (MCC), their biological mechanisms, modifiable risk factors, and best interventions to reduce or eliminate MCC burden in diverse adult populations, within the context of individual, family and community.",P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations,9760002,P20NR018075,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Biology ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Ecology ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Fatigue ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Patient Care ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Effect of GLP-1 on microvascular insulin responses in type 1 diabetes Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is significantly increased in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) compared with the general population. The CVD risk in T1DM is particularly exaggerated in women. Although thought of as an insulin deficient state, T1DM also exhibits insulin resistance (IR), which may relate to supraphysiologic insulin concentrations, hyperglycemia, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. In healthy humans, insulin causes vasodilation at the microvascular level in skeletal and cardiac muscles to increase endothelial surface area available for the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, and hormones such as insulin to these tissues. Using contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) and insulin clamp, we have confirmed the presence of vascular and metabolic IR in T1DM subjects. Women with T1DM may have greater IR compared with men with T1DM although this has not previously been studied at the vascular level. IR independently predicts both microvascular complications and macrovascular ones like CVD in T1DM. Thus far, there are no Federal Drug Administration approved medications which target IR or vascular complications in T1DM. In large, randomized controlled clinical trials, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes. We have previously shown that GLP-1 infusion increases skeletal and cardiac microvascular perfusion in healthy humans and restores insulin-mediated increase in skeletal and cardiac microvascular perfusion in IR rodents. The impact of GLP-1 in T1DM vascular and systemic IR remains unknown. The herein proposed research addresses the hypotheses that, in humans with T1DM, GLP-1 (a) increases microvascular perfusion and improves insulin's microvascular response in skeletal muscle thereby enhancing insulin- mediated glucose disposal and muscle oxygenation and (b) increases cardiac microvascular perfusion and improves insulin's microvascular response in the heart and large vessel function. We will also test a sub- hypothesis that women with T1DM have greater microvascular IR, but similar microvascular response to GLP- 1. We will utilize CEU to directly assess (1) the microvascular responses in skeletal and cardiac muscles to insulin in men and women with T1DM, comparing the two genders, and (2) whether GLP-1 infusion improves insulin-mediated skeletal and cardiac microvascular perfusion, large vessel compliance, and endothelial dysfunction in T1DM. The proposed studies will fill a current gap in knowledge regarding microvascular IR and tissue perfusion as well as vascular and systemic responses to GLP-1 in T1DM and the associated CVD risk gender disparity. If our hypotheses are validated, it will introduce a potential treatment avenue for mitigating IR and microvascular and macrovascular complications in T1DM. Project Narrative The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is substantially higher in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) compared with the general population, and there is convincing evidence of insulin resistance (IR) in T1DM which independently predicts diabetic complications like CVD. This research will examine the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on metabolic and microvascular IR and endothelial dysfunction in humans with T1DM. The results of this investigation will fill a gap in current knowledge concerning mechanisms underpinning IR and vascular complications in T1DM, with a particular emphasis on gender disparities as women with T1DM have poorer CVD outcomes, and introduce a potential treatment avenue to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications in T1DM.",Effect of GLP-1 on microvascular insulin

"Comparative Assessment of Modifying Social Determinants to Reduce Cardiovascular Disease Burden and Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Despite advancements in prevention and treatments for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), fiscal constraints have driven federal and state policymakers to make difficult choices among competing policy decisions, often without evidence of effectiveness. A comparative effectiveness approach, or in the absence of experimental data, a comparative assessment approach that compares the estimated impacts of modifying exposures using observational data, can critically inform this priority-setting process. We and others have demonstrated that social determinants, upstream social factors such as income inequality and social capital/cohesion, are key predictors of disease including CVD. Yet important questions remain about which social determinants have the biggest impacts on CVD burden. Furthermore, we lack knowledge on which subpopulations and states are most affected. In spite of calls for comparative assessments/effectiveness of strategies to improve population health and prevent CVD, including from NIH, we still lack knowledge on the relative CVD burden and economic impacts associated with modifying such factors. Given this information, there are critical needs to accurately estimate the impacts of social determinants on CVD risks; to translate these estimates into policy- setting tools including impacts on CVD burden and costs; and to compare and contrast the costs and sizes of these impacts. Our overall objective is to provide the first comparative assessment evidence base to compare the CVD burden and economic impacts of modifying key social determinants in middle-aged and older Americans. We will accomplish our overall objective by pursuing the following specific aims using data from two large, nationally-representative samples of middle-aged and older adults, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youths 1979 (NLSY) and the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), linked to social and economic measures by area of residence, and to Medicare claims and mortality databases: Aim #1) To determine which social determinants most strongly predict the risks of CVD incidence, mortality, and risk factors in middle-aged and older adults; Aim #2) To identify which subpopulations and geographic states are most vulnerable to the influences of social determinants on CVD burden and risk factors; and Aim #3) To determine which social determinants if modified are expected to yield the greatest reductions in CVD burden and its associated costs, both overall and by subpopulation. Regarding outcomes, our 3- year study is expected to identify the most promising social determinants on which to intervene to yield improvements in adult CVD burden. We will further establish how vulnerabilities to effects by geography and subpopulations may explain CVD disparities. By translating our estimates into population health and economic measures, we will directly respond to calls for comparative assessments and economic evaluations in CVD prevention research. Over the long term, we expect that our project will have high translational impact through guiding policymakers' evidence-based decisions to reduce CVD burden and inequities. PROJECT NARRATIVE (PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE) Using two large, nationally representative samples, this study will provide the first comparative assessment evidence base to compare the CVD burden and economic impacts of modifying key social determinants in middle-aged and older Americans, hence directly responding to calls for comparative assessments and economic evaluations in CVD prevention research.

"CV Wizard: Does a Prioritized, Point-of-Care Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Guideline-Based CVD Risk Factor Control in Safety Net Clinics? PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Substantial progress in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality would be achieved if evidence-based guidelines for CVD risk factor control were implemented consistently in primary care settings. Electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems that identify uncontrolled CVD risk factors and provide individualized care recommendations improved rates of guideline-concordant CVD care in large, integrated healthcare settings, but little is known about how effective such CDS may be in safety net community health centers (CHCs). CHCs' socioeconomically vulnerable patients have far worse CVD risk factor control and higher rates of major CVD events than the general population. Implementing CDS that leads to improved CVD risk factor control in CHCs could reduce national disparities in CVD outcomes, but CHCs rarely have the resources to develop sophisticated CDS, and very few currently have such systems for CVD care. The proposed study is designed to address this. We will randomize 60 CHCs with a shared EHR to immediate vs. delayed implementation of a sophisticated CDS system that provides point-of-care CVD care recommendations to the primary care provider and the patient, and has been proven highly successful in large, integrated care settings. Before implementing the CDS, we will ask CHC patients and providers about the particular patient needs and perspectives and clinic workflows likely to influence adoption and impact of the CDS in CHCs. This input will inform development of CHC care team training strategies, and adaptation of the patient-facing aspects of the CDS system. We will measure adoption of the CDS, and impact of its use over time on CVD risk scores and risk factor control (blood pressure, HbA1c, lipid levels; aspirin use; smoking; body mass index) in high-CVD risk CHC patients. We will also conduct a mixed methods process evaluation, to identify facilitators and barriers to use of the CDS, and to iteratively develop and test strategies for supporting its adoption and ongoing use in CHC workflows. We anticipate that this intervention could (a) improve CVD care among low-income CHC patients, (b) reduce CVD care disparities between CHC populations and national rates, and (c) facilitate greater CHC patient engagement in CVD treatment decision-making and prioritization. The proposed work directly responds to PAR 15-279 goals: it addresses gaps in guideline- based care in high-risk populations with targeted, innovative, multi-level strategies; considers setting-specific needs; and supports patient engagement. Our team's research experience and established partnerships with key healthcare system stakeholders increase the likelihood of project success. Results will yield EHR- agnostic CDS tools for use by any CHC with an implementation guide, build knowledge about how to minimize disparities in CVD care and outcomes using scalable CDS strategies, and help translate investments in informatics into clinical benefit for millions of high-risk, low-income Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project aims to reduce disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control and in rates of heart attacks and strokes among the low-income, racially / ethnically diverse Americans who receive primary care at safety net community health centers (CHCs). To achieve this important objective, we will adapt a successful clinical decision support (CDS) system currently used in CVD care at several large, integrated health care systems, to meet the patient needs and workflow processes of 60 CHCs. We will determine if use of this CDS improves CVD care, reduces disparities in CVD care and outcomes, and increases patient engagement in CVD treatment choices, in CHCs. Results of this randomized trial will help accelerate the translation of major investments in health informatics systems into substantial clinical benefits for large numbers of high-risk, low-income patients. Results will also provide a template for CVD care improvement that can be spread to other CHCs and extended to other clinical conditions.","CV Wizard: Does a Prioritized, Point-of-Care Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Guideline-Based CVD Risk Factor Control in Safety Net Clinics?",9692773,R01HL133793,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Community Developments ', ' Decision Making ', ' Goals ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' HbA1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' Hb A1c ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' web based ', ' online computer ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' Online Systems ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk Management ', ' Smoking ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' integrated health system ', ' Integrated Delivery of Health Care ', ' integrated delivery of healthcare ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' Protocol ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' General Population ', ' General Public ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' point of care ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' electronic health care record ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Outcome ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' safety net ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient oriented ', ' patient centered ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' public health priorities ', ' randomized trial ', ' Randomization trial ', ' arm ', ' personalized care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' individualized care ', ' Precision care ', ' support tools ', ' treatment choice ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' high risk population ', ' high risk group ', ' secondary analysis ', ' care providers ', ' primary care provider ', ' health care settings ', ' healthcare settings ', ' care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' health care outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' clinical decision support ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2019,743860,0.29304808153068373
"Project Title: PROSPECT: Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic Disease Trends PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite efforts to prevent chronic diseases, they continue to increase, with underserved ethnic minorities bearing the greatest burden. The United States (US) territory of Puerto Rico (PR) has high prevalence of multiple cardiometabolic conditions that increase risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence supports a direct link between psychosocial and food-related environmental risk factors, and cardiometabolic conditions, but these remain markedly understudied at the island-wide population level in PR, despite the clear and pressing need to alleviate the burden of chronic disease in the island. On September 2017, hurricane Maria devastated PR, imposing urgency for studying trends and associations of risk factors for cardiometabolic conditions under times of distress. Thus, the overall goal for this application is to identify trends and longitudinal associations in psychosocial, food-related, and cardiometabolic risk factors that can guide public health priorities and future research needs aimed at reducing CVD-related disparities in PR. To this end, we will establish `PROSPECT: Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic disease Trends', an island-wide, longitudinal population cohort of 2,000 adults (30-75y) in PR recruited with a multi-frame sampling of probabilistic plus community approaches, and assessed in a network of several partner clinics across the island. The study will collect comprehensive data on multiple psychosocial, dietary, and food-related factors, CVD biological markers, and medical record data, with follow-up at 2-years, and will assess variations by urban-rural area and by timing before-after Maria. PROSPECT builds upon the feasibility and resources established by a 2015 pilot study in PR, and emulates the goals and methods of US and Caribbean cohorts inclusive of mainland Puerto Ricans and other Latinos for comparison.  Our specific aims are to: (1) estimate baseline and 2y prevalence of psychosocial, diet and food-related environment, and biological CVD risk factors, (2) determine longitudinal associations between 2y changes in psychosocial factors and biological CVD risk factors, (3) determine longitudinal associations between 2y changes in diet and food-related factors, and biological CVD risk factors, and (4) estimate differences in prevalence and 2y changes in risk factors by urban vs. rural area, and pre vs. post-Maria.  PROSPECT will identify priorities for addressing CVD risk factors, and will let us plan and implement tailored public health programs and interventions to effectively improve cardiometabolic health in a high-risk, underserved group. The project will enhance collaborative health research, leadership, and capacity in PR, and has high potential for sustainability by using existing infrastructure, and for comparability with US cohorts. Our new island-wide probabilistic comprehensive longitudinal study will bridge a gap in knowledge in PR, create a biorepository and participant database for future use, yield seminal data to support tailored translation into programs and policy, and compellingly reduce disparities in cardiometabolic health in PR. NARRATIVE Cardiometabolic conditions, and the psychosocial and food-related (e.g. diet) factors that may influence them, have not been properly studied in Puerto Rico (PR), despite high prevalence of chronic disease in this US territory. This is important to understand after hurricane Maria. Our goal is to build a longitudinal island-wide population cohort of adults in PR (`PROSPECT') with comprehensive data on risk factors and cardiovascular biomarkers, in order to enhance collaborative health research, leadership, and capacity in PR, create a biorepository and participant database, and yield seminal data on trends that can guide tailored public health programs and policy and future

"Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this K24 renewal is for Dr. Corbie-Smith to establish a premier research infrastructure to provide exceptional training for the next generation of CVD researchers who address the health and healthcare of patients who bear a disproportionate burden of CVD morbidity and mortality. Dr. Corbie-Smith has made excellent use of the support provided in the first cycle of her K24. She has been highly productive, with an impressive trajectory of peer-reviewed publications in the emerging field of community engaged research. She has been successful in funding her work, obtaining a new R01 grant focused on dissemination of an evidence based intervention to reduce CVD risk in rural African American populations. She has mentored her first trainees to independence, and new trainees she has mentored with her K24 support have been successful in terms of publications and funding. She has successfully mentored trainees in diverse fields such as nursing, medicine, health behavior, and epidemiology and the vast majority of trainees are scholars of color. This renewal will make it possible for the candidate to further develop her research program, and use her research program as a platform for her mentoring. She will leverage her ongoing R01, the Center for Health Equity Research, the Sheps Center for Health Services Research and NC Translational and Clinical Sciences Institute, as a resource for her mentees. Bringing together the extensive career development resources of the Center for Health Equity Research, Sheps and NC Translational and Clinical Science Institute with the mentoring resources of the K24 gives the candidate a unique opportunity to develop exceptional mentoring to improve CVD outcomes. The proposed aims are to: (1) engage community members to define, map and programs. Finally, she will use the K24 to develop an innovative new research direction, examining the association between organizational networks in rural AA communities and sustainability of CVD interventions assess CVD risk reduction assets available in rural settings; (2) use mixed methods to understand the factors (communication, cooperation, and competition) that influence collaboration among organizations with CVD risk reduction programming; (3) conduct network analysis to understand how organizational networks change over time in rural communities among organizations conducting CVD risk reduction programming; and (4) examine the association between organizational networks and a) sustainability of CVD risk reduction interventions and b) CVD outcomes among participants in those interventions. The candidate will also continue a formal mentoring program with plans for the recruitment, selection, development, and evaluation of mentees who will become successful leaders in CVD disparities research. Each mentee will have a focused career development plan that includes directed didactic and developmental activities and a mentored research project that will lead to first author publications. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed research is relevant to public health because disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD risk factors are dramatic in rural and minority communities with limited access to quality healthcare. In this proposal, we will define assets that already exist in communities to reduce CVD risk and examine how organizational assets and networks evolve and are associated with sustainability of interventions to reduce population CVD risk. Combined with the mentoring component, to train new and early stage researchers to conduct high impact CVD prevention research, the proposed research is highly relevant to NHLBI's mission to enhance the health of patients so that they can live longer and more fulfilling lives.",Mentoring in community-engaged approaches to address CVD disparities,9685202,K24HL105493,"['Alcohol consumption ', ' ethanol use ', ' ethanol product use ', ' ethanol intake ', ' ethanol ingestion ', ' ethanol drinking ', ' ethanol consumption ', ' alcoholic drink intake ', ' alcoholic beverage consumption ', ' alcohol use ', ' alcohol product use ', ' alcohol intake ', ' alcohol ingestion ', ' EtOH use ', ' EtOH drinking ', ' Alcohol Drinking ', ' Ursidae Family ', ' bear ', ' Ursidae ', ' Bears ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Color ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Dairy Products ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' services research ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Health Services Research ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Institutes ', ' interventions research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventional research ', ' intervention research ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Maps ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Peer Review ', ' Public Health ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' healthcare quality ', ' health care quality ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' socioenvironment ', ' social context ', ' social climate ', ' Social Environment ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' wt-loss ', ' body weight loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Work ', ' County ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Rural Community ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Phase ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' salt intake ', ' behavior change ', ' interest ', ' Physical environment ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' saturated fat ', ' saturated lipid ', ' saturated dietary lipid ', ' saturated dietary fat ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' Prevention Research ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' member ', ' social ', ' Pathway Analysis ', ' Network Analysis ', ' career development ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Weight maintenance regimen ', ' weight management ', ' weight control ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Randomized ', ' randomly assigned ', ' randomization ', ' randomisation ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Resource Development ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' fruits and vegetables ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' public health relevance ', ' community setting ', ' health equity ', ' mobile computing ', ' mobile technology ', ' mobile platform ', ' minority communities ', ' rural African American ', ' rural setting ', ' rural place ', ' rural locality ', ' recruit ', ' service programs ', ' outreach services ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,K24,2019,115363,0.2611619605479507
"Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges ABSTRACT CVD disparities across the race/ethnic and socioeconomic gradients are exacerbated by barriers to receiving guideline-based primary or secondary preventive treatment—such as appropriate blood pressure, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes treatment.1–6 Most patients not receiving guideline-based treatment are actually insured and have seen a primary care provider in the past year.1 To reduce CVD disparities by better targeting disease prevention and treatment, healthcare administrators and county departments of public health have begun pooling data resources across healthcare and public health systems—such as across clinics, emergency rooms and hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and administrative datasets.7–9 The idea behind pooling such datasets is to better identify persons most in need, and direct targeted interventions to them. Solano County, California, a medium-sized, diverse, low-income county, has developed one of the first, and most comprehensive health information exchanges (HIEs), including: (i) electronic health record data from all emergency rooms, hospitals, primary care and specialty clinics and care facilities in the county; (ii) labs from all laboratory service providers; (iii) prescription details from all pharmacies; (iv) validated social determinants of health surveys administered in clinics; and (v) administrative datasets, including welfare, disability, housing, and geocoded neighborhood features. While several other counties are following suit to develop large, secure HIEs across healthcare and public health systems, a key challenge remains: how to cheaply, accurately, and rapidly analyze HIEs to identify which persons should be targeted for interventions. Without reliable, user- friendly, cost-effective, and generalizable data analysis programs, counties are unable to use the massive data at their disposal to address preventable causes of morbidity and mortality. The objective of this application is to apply our unique machine-learning innovations to develop open-source programs that can enable counties to identify persons at high risk for preventable CVD events and deaths. We will test the hypothesis that electronic health record data alone are insufficient to provide accurate risk prediction for preventable CVD events and deaths. Rather, we believe that key survey and administrative data providing information on social determinants of health will improve identification of high-risk patients. To test our hypothesis, we will develop and validate open-source, generalizable programs to: (Aim 1) rapidly identify persons in need of improved primary and secondary prevention of CVD by systematically comparing the performance of three alternative machine learning approaches to read HIE data, as compared to human clinician chart reviewers; and (Aim 2) perform multi-level risk assessment by automatically calibrating and validating models of CVD event risk, utilization and cost to HIE data, to identify the added value of administrative and social determinants data as compared to clinical or claims-based data alone. Our work will produce generalizable software tools for counties across the country to analyze HIE data and reduce preventable CVD disparities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) disparities are exacerbated by inadequate guideline-based treatment of CVD risk factors. Furthermore, risk adjustment models currently used to target interventions and pay for healthcare services only use claims-based data such as demographics and clinical diagnostic codes, ignoring social determinants of health. Our research will rigorously develop and test novel machine learning methods that incorporate social determinants data from large Health Information Exchanges, producing novel data tools that will enable health systems nationwide to better detect individuals who could use improvements in their preventive therapy for CVD, and improve risk adjustment models to identify persons at high risk for preventable healthcare utilization and cost.",Developing data tools to reduce CVD disparities via Health Information Exchanges,9766361,R21MD012867,"['Blood Pressure ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Goals ', ' Gold ', ' Health ', ' care facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Health care facility ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health workforce ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Surveys ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' Hospital Admission ', ' Hospitalization ', ' Hospitals ', ' Housing ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Information Technology Systems ', ' IT Systems ', ' Data Systems ', ' Information Systems ', ' Insurance ', ' Laboratories ', ' Literature ', ' Methods ', ' Cardiovascular Models ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI Persons with serious mental illness (SMI) comprise one of the most highly vulnerable groups in the US, dying 10 to 20 years earlier and with mortality rates two to over three times higher than the overall population. Much of this premature death is attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is potentially preventable; all CVD risk behaviors (unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco smoking) and risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia) are markedly elevated in persons with SMI. Concomitantly, persons with SMI often receive poor quality of care for these conditions. While these health and mortality gaps are widely recognized as a public health crisis, individual, provider, organizational, and policy level barriers impede progress. While many persons with SMI receive most of their care from the public mental health sector, tailored interventions to decrease CVD risk shown effective in clinical trials for those with SMI (e.g., for weight loss, smoking cessation) have not been widely adopted in community mental health settings. Meaningfully advancing health and decreasing mortality disparities for persons with SMI requires urgent development and testing of implementation strategies for scale-up of practical, effective interventions.  In response to this extraordinary burden of years of life lost, our goal is to create the Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI that will use cutting-edge transdisciplinary methods towards short and long-term progress to reduce CVD risk in this highly vulnerable population. The Center’s uniquely qualified team will conduct 3 R34 studies to develop and pilot test innovative implementation strategies to address all CVD risk behaviors and risk factors in persons with SMI in community mental health settings. The R34s will focus on evidence-based approaches for: 1) behavioral weight loss with diet and physical activity; 2) tobacco smoking cessation treatment; 3) care delivery for diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. The Methods Core will use a transdisciplinary approach incorporating clinical and behavioral intervention research, implementation science, human factors engineering, systems science, and health services research to support Center research. The Methods Core will also advance research methods in 1) human factors engineering to support implementation; 2) avatar-assisted training and assessment in motivational interviewing; 3) quantitative methods to support intervention scale-up; 4) and systems science. The Administrative Core will engage stakeholders, building on well-established partnerships in Maryland and nationally, and bring together all of the Center’s activities. The gaping differential in life expectancy and CVD risk factor burden in persons with SMI calls for concentrated, transdisciplinary approaches to solutions. This Center will create a nexus of innovation and momentum around T2 translation to reduce premature mortality in SMI. Our vision is health equity – that persons with SMI, similar to persons without SMI, live long healthy lives. Persons with serious mental illness (SMI) are one of the most highly vulnerable groups in the US, dying 10 to 20 years earlier than the overall population, primarily due to cardiovascular disease. The proposed Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI will develop and test innovative strategies for scaling-up effective interventions to address cardiovascular risk behaviors (unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco smoking) and risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia) among consumers with SMI.

"Reducing Cardiovascular Risk in Perimenopausal Latinas: Pilot Study of a Multi-Component Intervention PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death among women. Risk of CVD increases substantially during perimenopause, the critical window of 6-8 years before a woman’s final menstrual period. Increasing evidence suggests that Latinas have a significantly worse CVD risk factor profile than non-Hispanic women, which can be attributed to multiple sociocultural and environmental factors (e.g., lower socioeconomic position, discrimination, stress). These factors are related to CVD through their influence on health behaviors, as well as potential mechanisms involving inflammatory and neuroendocrine pathways. Although behavioral intervention research targeting CVD risk during perimenopause emerged over the past decade, no studies were designed to intervene on behavioral influences to decrease biological CVD risk among perimenopausal Latinas. Using the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Framework, we will address the sociocultural and built environments and intervene on behavioral influences to decrease biologic CVD risk among perimenopausal Latinas. The aim of this investigation is to examine feasibility and initial efficacy of a behavioral intervention led by community health workers to a) decrease the primary outcomes of biologic CVD risk factors (blood pressure [BP], arterial stiffness, lipids, blood glucose); b) improve secondary outcomes (health behaviors: nutrition, physical activity, sleep, coping strategies) and other biological factors (adiposity, inflammatory and stress biomarkers, vasomotor symptoms) from baseline to 6- and 12-month follow-up. We will recruit participants from two community groups: one group will be randomly assigned to complete the intervention; the other will be a wait-list control. This intervention has 3 phases: 12 weekly sessions (Phase I: education, physical activity, stress management, coping skills training) followed by 3 monthly sessions of continued support (Phase II); and finally 6 months of skill maintenance on their own (Phase III). The long-term goal of this award is to develop Dr. Cortés’ independence as an investigator, leading a program of research dedicated to improving women’s cardiovascular health, and to implement interventions for prevention and self-management of CVD in perimenopausal women, particularly Latinas. The proposed K23 will support her development through mentorship and training in: 1) community-engaged research; 2) clinical trial design, implementation, and evaluation; 3) the effect of behavioral interventions on biologic outcomes; and 4) professional development skills in leadership, publication, and grantsmanship. To accomplish her research aims and training goals, Dr. Cortés has assembled an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in community engagement, intervention design, clinical trial analysis, sociocultural and biological measures, and career development mentorship. This research holds potential to accelerate greatly the acquisition of knowledge related to CVD risk among perimenopausal Latinas, and the impact of behavioral interventions to reduce CVD risk in this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because perimenopausal Latinas remain considerably less likely than non-Hispanic White women to meet physical activity and dietary guidelines, or be aware that CVD is the leading cause of death among women. Because Hispanic/Latinos are the largest ethnic minority in the United States (US), progress regarding CVD risk among perimenopausal Latinas may lead to significant improvement in the overall CVD burden in the US. Furthermore, the proposed research may provide insight on the interplay among sociocultural and built environments, behavioral influences and biological influences contributing to women’s overall

"Corazón de la Familia (Heart of the Family) ABSTRACT Hispanics have significantly higher rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk burden compared to non-Hispanic whites. Dramatic increases in rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in U.S. Hispanics are anticipated as the population ages and acculturation lends to engagement in unhealthy behaviors. Culturally appropriate lifestyle modification strategies are needed for effective risk reduction. Most lifestyle modification strategies have focused on individuals and sustained engagement in healthy behaviors is seldom achieved. Respectful of the Hispanic cultural value of familismo, prioritizing of the well-being of the family over that of the individual, we propose to conduct a family dyad-focused intervention that addresses family members as active participants in a lifestyle intervention for Hispanics with high risk for T2D or CVD. “Corazón de la Familia” (“Heart of the Family”) is a promotores’- (community health workers’) facilitated intervention that integrates evidence-based education and health behavior skills development with social support strategies through the involvement of family members. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial using a 2-group design and compare the short-term and long-term impact of the family dyad-focused active intervention to an individual-focused control condition on biological and behavioral T2D and CVD risk factors. Furthermore, we will determine how each active intervention dyad member’s engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors and level of support for their partner’s engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors affects their own and their partner’s outcomes. Guided by community-based participatory research principles, our community-academic partnership was formed in response to needs recognized by Hispanic residents of Kentucky for socioculturally tailored health promotion programs to reduce T2D and CVD risk. Hispanic community partners have been integrally involved in all phases of sociocultural tailoring and pilot testing the Corazón de la Familia intervention. The result of the work of our community-academic partnership is a family dyad-focused intervention that provides a unique approach to sustain engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to reduce T2D and CVD risk among at-risk Hispanics. Further, this community-based intervention has significant potential for broad implementation to successfully address T2D and CVD health disparities across U.S. Hispanic communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a community-based participatory research approach, this is a community-academic partnership initiative to reduce type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk in Hispanic community members with high risk for these diseases. The promotores (community health workers) facilitated intervention engages family dyads to support healthy lifestyle behaviors among dyad members, integrating skills-based risk reduction approaches with social support strategies.

"Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one killer of women in the United States and African-American women have strikingly high rates of CVD-related death and disability compared to White women. These stark racial disparities have persisted for decades, have increased among young to middle-aged women, and are not explained by traditional clinical risk factors or socioeconomic status (SES). Racism-related stressors have been proposed as one potential pathway through which ""race"" impacts cardiovascular health; but most studies have focused on interpersonal experiences of racism, which may actually underestimate the impact of racism- related psychosocial stress on CVD. The proposed research is designed to determine whether a novel, racism-related stressor -""expectations of racism"" --is a risk factor for early CVD in African-American women. We have compelling cross-sectional preliminary data demonstrating that among African-American women, ""expectations"" of racism are associated with measurable indices of CVD; independent of actual experiences of racism, and other forms of psychosocial stress. This application builds upon this prior work by using innovative methodologies from public health and psychology to determine whether, in what contexts, and how this unique psychosocial stressor contributes to CVD risk in African-American women over time. We will examine expectations of racism and increases in early CVD risk over a 2-year follow up in a community sample of 400 healthy African-American women aged 30-45. Early CVD risk will be assessed via changes in carotid intima media thickening (CIMT), a measure of atherosclerosis, and 48-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), a measure of autonomic physiologic arousal and a potential mechanism linking expectations of racism to IMT. Additionally, because research suggests that expectations of racism are largely influenced by context, we will examine whether associations are more pronounced among women with high (vs. low) levels of exposure to interracial contact (assessed via novel measures of ""activity spaces"" that can determine the average percentage of time spent in integrated vs. segregated environments). Finally, in order to determine how high levels of expected racism contribute to physiological responses and psychological distress on a day-to-day basis, we will conduct a daily diary study in a subsample of women, to examine daily ABP reactivity to interpersonal stressors, as well as day-to-day affect. Secondary aims will examine additional psychosocial stressors and cultural resources as potential moderators, and rumination, negative affect and social disconnectedness as potential mediators. Findings from this study will ultimately be used to develop psychosocial interventions to help African-American women at risk for CVD cope with the threat of expected racism. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The goal of the proposed research is to determine whether a novel, racism-related psychosocial stressor is a unique risk factor for early cardiovascular disease (CVD) in young to middle-aged African-American women. Recent research suggests that African-American women aged 35-44 have rates of CVD that are higher than those of African-American men, White men, and White women. These disparities are not due to obesity or other traditional CVD risk factors and are likely to increase over time. Identifying the determinants of early CVD in African-American women will be key to designing preventive interventions for this understudied, at risk group, and ultimately reducing their excess burden of disease.",Expectations of Discrimination and CVD Risk in Africian-American Women,9634079,R01HL130471,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Anxiety ', ' Arousal ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Disease Frequency Surveys ', ' Cross-Sectional Survey ', ' Cross-Sectional Analyses ', ' Cross Sectional Analysis ', ' Cross-Sectional Studies ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Ethnic group ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Hostility ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Methodology ', ' midlife ', ' middle aged ', ' mid-life ', ' mid life ', ' middle age ', ' Moods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' platelet factor IV ', ' gamma-Thromboglobulin ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine Subfamily B, Member 4 ', ' Small Inducible Cytokine B4 ', ' Recombinant Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Heparin Neutralizing Protein ', ' Factor 4 ', ' Chemokine (C-X-C motif) Ligand 4 ', ' Blood platelet factor 4 ', ' Blood Platelet Factor IV ', ' Antiheparin Factor ', ' Platelet Factor 4 ', ' Play ', ' Public Health ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social isolation ', ' Socialization ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' depressive ', ' depression symptom ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Mediating ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Friendships ', ' Area ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' racism ', ' Link ', ' disability ', ' Health Psychology ', ' Exposure to ', ' Depressed mood ', ' sadness ', ' depressed ', ' Life ', ' diaries ', ' Investigation ', ' Hour ', ' Event ', ' psychosocial ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' psychological distress ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Mediator of activation protein ', ' Mediator of Activation ', ' Mediator ', ' Data ', ' Measurable ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Feeling ', ' feelings ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' burden of illness ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' intima media ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' clinical risk ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' racial identity ', ' negative affect ', ' negative affectivity ', ' Financial Hardship ', ' financial stress ', ' financial strain ', ' financial distress ', ' financial burden ', ' ']",NHLBI,EMORY UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,1542425,0.22552220101449566
"Assessing the spatial heterogeneity in cardiovascular risk factors within and between blacks and whites PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT My goal for the K01 award is to establish myself as an independent cardiovascular researcher with expertise in spatial statistics and disease mapping methods and an integral member of multidisciplinary research teams devoted to addressing cardiovascular disparities. Attaining these objectives will require focused didactic training and research guidance. Training The proposed career development and training plan consists of four distinct components: (1) career guidance and mentoring in methodological development and collaborative cardiovascular research through on-site and off-site mentoring by cardiovascular and social epidemiologists as well as spatial statisticians and GIS specialists; (2) structured coursework designed at establishing a basic foundation in cardiovascular and social epidemiology and advanced training in spatial methods in collaboration with geographic information systems; (3) leading innovative research utilizing the gained training; and (4) contributing in the exchange of ideas in statistics and epidemiology through conference and workshop attendance. These proposed training activities will allow me to become well grounded in cardiovascular epidemiology and cardiovascular disease disparities. These activities will also focus on deepening my understanding of CVD, enabling me to reasonably assess the spatial heterogeneity in its associated risk factors within and between blacks and whites. Research The proposed work will explore the extent to which environmental factors and cardiovascular health (CVH) vary over space at a small-area local scale and at a regional scale with a focus on spatial variation in CVH among blacks and whites and spatial variation in black-white disparities in CVH. By combining a novel health indicator, the CVH index, with novel spatial methods, this proposed work will better characterize the geographic heterogeneity in CVH for blacks and whites and for black-white disparities. Our novel statistical methods will be applied to two very rich and unique cohorts, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) cohort and the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort. The larger goal of this work is to define these differences in a way that provides evidence for targeted interventions to improve the built environment. Additionally, our findings will help support informed health policies to improve the cardiovascular health of both blacks and whites. PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a significant public health problem. Finding ways to impact CVD is essential to better public health and to inform policy makers regarding the effect of various policies on cardiovascular risk. Our proposed methods will explore the impact of both individual and environmental risk factors for CVD, across two geographically, diverse NIH funded cohorts. The knowledge to be gained will focus on assessing the spatial heterogeneity of CVD risk factors within and between blacks and whites, and will inform the future development and implementation of policies.",Assessing the spatial heterogeneity in cardiovascular risk factors within and between blacks and whites,9730569,K01HL133515,"['Adult ', ' adulthood ', ' Adult Human ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Affect ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cholesterol ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Disorder ', ' Disease ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' healthcare policy ', ' health care policy ', ' Health Policy ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' indexing ', ' Literature ', ' longterm study ', ' long-term study ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' statistics ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Supervision ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' United States ', ' executive coaching ', ' career counselor ', ' Vocational Counseling ', ' Occupational Guidance ', ' Career Guidance ', ' Career Counseling ', ' Vocational Guidance ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' Specialist ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Serum ', ' Blood Serum ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Policies ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Development Plans ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' good diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' Healthy diet ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disease epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Secondary Prevention ', ' member ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Statistical Methods ', ' Geographic Information Systems ', ' geospatial information system ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Sampling ', ' career development ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Mentored Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Research Scientist Development Award ', ' Mentored Training Award ', ' K01 Program ', ' K01 Mechanism ', ' K01 Award ', ' Collection ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Behavioral ', ' fasting plasma glucose ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' social disparities ', ' aged ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' spatiotemporal ', ' Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' black/white disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis ', ' ']",NHLBI,DREXEL UNIVERSITY,K01,2019,159870,0.10834618311585985
"Preterm birth and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease in mothers and offspring Currently about 1 of every 10 births in the US occurs preterm (gestational age <37 completed weeks), and because of advances in treatment, >95% of preterm infants survive to adulthood. Recent research has shown that both the mothers and offspring of preterm birth (PTB) have higher long-term risks of metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mothers who deliver preterm may also have higher long- term CVD incidence; however, the reported risks of CVD in adult offspring of PTB have been conflicting. A recent Trans-NIH Working Group highlighted a pressing need for studies that: (1) stratify long-term CVD risks by PTB subtype (e.g., spontaneous vs. indicated due to maternal/fetal conditions) to help elucidate underlying mechanisms and tailor long-term patient care; (2) allow longer follow-up into mid-adulthood or later when disease risks remain poorly understood; and (3) include large sample sizes to allow examination of long-term outcomes with high statistical power. We hypothesize that: (1) PTB is associated with higher long-term risks of CVD (i.e., ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, aortic disease) among mothers and adult offspring, with increasing dose-response relationships by earlier gestational age; and (2) These associations exist for all major types of PTB, but are stronger for those related to placental insufficiency (e.g., preeclampsia or diabetes), which is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to structural microvascular changes. To address these hypotheses, we propose to conduct the first comprehensive examination of PTB and its subtypes in relation to CVD risks among mothers and their adult offspring. We will assemble and analyze national databases containing all ~2.3 million births to ~1.2 million mothers in Sweden during 1973-1995 and all inpatient and outpatient diagnoses of CVD through 2015. Our specific aims are to: (1) Examine PTB and its subtypes in relation to long-term risks of CVD and CVD-related outcomes (hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea) in mothers and adult offspring; (2) determine if there are sociodemographic subgroups that are more susceptible to PTB effects on long-term risks; and (3) explore potential confounding effects of unmeasured familial (genetic and shared environmental) factors on PTB-CVD associations using co-relative analyses. The proposed research is significant because PTB is common and unprecedented numbers of survivors are now reaching adulthood (~400,000/year in the US); thus even modestly increased long-term risks translate into a large population health burden. It is innovative because it will provide the first comprehensive examination of PTB and its subtypes in relation to CVD risks, and use a co-relative design to disentangle familial confounding. It is highly cost-efficient because we will assemble these data from national registries that are unavailable or prohibitively costly to collect in the US. The results will have major impacts by establishing the long-term CVD risks associated with PTB and its subtypes among mothers and adult offspring, and informing clinical guidelines for better risk assessment and long-term care. NARRATIVE Preterm birth (PTB) is common and may be linked with higher risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the mothers and offspring. The proposed research will provide the first comprehensive examination of PTB and its subtypes in relation to long-term risks of CVD among mothers and their adult offspring, using large-scale cohort data. The results will have major impacts by informing clinical guidelines for better risk assessment, anticipatory screening, and long-term patient care.",Preterm birth and long-term risk of cardiovascular

"Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans ABSTRACT  This mixed-methods study utilizes a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets and qualitative data collection, to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion and Spirituality (R/S) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk factors. CVD risk factors, especially high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and depression, disproportionately affect African Americans in prevalence and/or severity, contributing to the higher associated mortality rate. Further, examining lifestyle choices (for example, diet and exercise) without appropriate sociocultural context does not provide practice-ready solutions on the manifestations, root causes and potential strategies for eliminating African American’s heightened CVD risks. As such, religion and spirituality (R/S) in the African American community have been acknowledged for their positive influence on social behaviors and emotional health, but have not been sufficiently examined for their role in attenuating or exacerbating physical health outcomes and in particular, the risks associated with CVD. Most research has compared the relationship between R/S and health outcomes by examining the specific denominations of their White participants, and blanketed Black participants’ religion to the “Black Church.” This approach disregards the diversity of beliefs, behaviors and ways of thinking found in the religious affiliation and denominations of African Americans. In a rare project that examined Black health outcomes in relation to specific religious affiliation/denomination, it was revealed that religious attendance had an inverse relationship based upon religious affiliation/denomination on black mortality rates not found in white participants. Thus, the standard of relying on religious affiliation and health studies based on White participants to determine expected outcomes for Black participants is likely to cause inaccuracies in research and interventions. The overarching goals of this research are to investigate the extent to which R/S is related to CVD risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression) through the use of robust secondary and primary data analysis. The two project Aims will use theoretically-, research- and data-driven evidence to bolster efforts to decrease CVD risk factors and improve health outcomes for African Americans. Aim 1 utilizes structural equational modeling to determine if R/S has direct and indirect effects on CVD risk factors through health behaviors. Aim 2 establishes how the relationships manifest through first-hand accounts of the attributes of specific denominations on the health outcomes of its congregants, thus allowing participants to explain how the relationships found in Aim 1 are manifested-or not, in their daily and R/S life. The purpose of this research project is to not only identify the direct and indirect relationships between CVD risk factors and R/S, but to provide in depth knowledge of core attitudes, beliefs, organizational structures, and/or practices that facilitate or attenuate positive health outcomes for African Americans. The precision and nuance of our project’s strategies will fill in significant gaps in research and practice that can be a catalyst for evidence-based interventions that examines of community and religious institutions to support positive health outcomes for African American. Project Narrative The proposed mixed-methods study will utilize a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets (Add Health, National Survey of American Life and the Jackson Heart Study) and qualitative primary data collection to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion/Spirituality (R/S) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors- including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression for African Americans, while considering religious affiliation/denomination. Our strategy will fill in significant gaps in public research and effective community and religious based interventions by providing specific and nuanced data that can help build accuracy and researcher- participant trust. Considering R/S and CVD risk factors, Aim 1 addresses what relationships are there using secondary data analysis and Aim 2 establishes how the findings in Aim 1 are manifested (or not) through interviews and focus groups with African American community members and religious leaders and congregants.","Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans",9966068,R01MD011606,"['Affect ', ' Age Factors ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Religion ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Socialization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Trust ', ' Protestant ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Equation ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' religious group ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Categories ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' informant ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community setting ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' Add Health ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,398857,0.21325356453542021
"Role of Skeletal Muscle Health on Poor LIfestyle Related Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary  Population-based studies have traditionally focused on measurement of body fat (i.e. obesity) to assess the contribution of poor lifestyles to insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. While much less recognized is the role of skeletal muscle in these conditions. Built on our proposed biobehavioral model which incorporates multi- dimensional evaluation of skeletal muscle health (i.e. mass, function, strength, and intermuscular fat infiltration) and its molecular transducer (i.e. myokine response to whole body vibration), the fundamental objective of this proposal is to evaluate the systemic contribution of skeletal muscle health in mediating the role of obesogenic lifestyles (i.e. psychosocial stress, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) on insulin resistance and the development of preclinical markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (i.e. arterial stiffness, carotid intima media thickness and endothelial function). To evaluate the impact of environmental factors on manifestation of biological markers, genetic influences must be controlled. Building on our Georgia CV Twin Study which has evaluated a multi-ethnic twin samples of 532 twin pairs with roughly equal number of African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA) 4 times over 15 years and has physical activity and psychosocial stress collected during these visits, we will conduct one additional follow-up visit (age range 22-45 yrs) to measure skeletal muscle health, insulin resistance and preclinical markers of CVD. The specific aims are to test the hypotheses that: (1) Obesogenic lifestyle factors (i.e. psychosocial stress, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet) will jointly or distinctively impair skeletal muscle health, and impaired skeletal muscle health will be the pathway through which obesogenic lifestyle factors exert their influence on insulin resistance and preclinical markers of CVD. (2) Myokine response to whole body vibration will be the molecular transducers mediating the effect of skeletal muscle health on insulin resistance and preclinical markers of CVD. (3) Ethnicity and gender may modify the influence of obesogenic lifestyle factors upon aim 1 and 2. The secondary aims are: (1) To examine whether skeletal muscle health can explain the health disparity between AAs and EAs in the risk of type 2 diabetes and CVD. (2) To examine the potential effects of gene-environment interactions on skeletal muscle response to obesogenic lifestyles. This proposal represents a paradigm shift by focusing on impairments in skeletal muscle rather than adiposity as a cause of poor lifestyle induced metabolic and vascular dysfunction. This information can not only guide the effective dissemination of the knowledge and increase the success rate of behavior changes, but also has the potential to generate new treatment strategies targeting the critical illness in which skeletal muscle as a determinant of survival. Furthermore, increased understanding of the mechanisms contributing to health disparities between AAs and EAs will enable the development of ethnicity- specific prevention strategies. Project Narrative  Population-based studies have traditionally focused on the measurement of body fat (i.e. obesity) to assess the contribution of poor lifestyles to insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. This project aims to find how skeletal muscle health and its molecular transducer play a role in chronic diseases linked with unhealthy lifestyle such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.",Role of Skeletal Muscle Health on Poor LIfestyle Related Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9791348,R01DK117365,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Critical Illness ', ' type two diabetes ', ' type II DM ', ' type 2 DM ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2 DM ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' NIDDM ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Endothelium ', ' Vascular Endothelium ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fats ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Habits ', ' Half-Life ', ' Health ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Mitochondria ', ' muscular ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' Muscle ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Peptides ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Tissues ', ' Transducers ', ' Twins ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' vasculopathy ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Adipocytes ', ' Mature fat cell ', ' Mature Lipocyte ', ' Lipocytes ', ' Fat Cells ', ' Adipose Cell ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' muscle form ', ' muscle mass ', ' muscle bulk ', ' Measurement ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Twin Studies ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Infiltration ', ' Shapes ', ' Body fat ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' vibration ', ' muscle strength ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' GxE interaction ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' success ', ' energy balance ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' artery stiffness ', ' artery stiffening ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Population Study ', ' study of the population ', ' studies of populations ', ' population-level study ', ' population-based study ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' life-style factor ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' pre-clinical ', ' preclinical ', ' biobehavior ', ' biobehavioral ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment strategy ', ' Biological Markers ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' obesogenic ', ' obesigenic ', ' unhealthy lifestyle ', ' physical inactivity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' preclinical development ', ' pre-clinical development ', ' preservation ', ' weight loss program ', ' weight loss programming ', ' Metabolic dysfunction ', ' carotid intima-media thickness ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' ']",NIDDK,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,670676,0.0525589457624919
"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist. Project Narrative The overarching objective of this K01 career development award is to foster the transition of Dr. Azizi Seixas into an independent scientist in the area of sleep and cardiovascular disease and health disparities. The proposed study will investigate a novel mechanism underlying associations between insufficient sleep, obesity, and disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Findings from the study will be the basis of sleep and obesity interventions to reduce CVD risk, especially among diverse groups burdened by cardiovascular disease.",The effect of insufficient sleep

"Diet and metabolic risks: joint drivers of global epidemiologic transition  DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Background - Diet and its effects on metabolic risk factors are key drivers of the global epidemiologic transition. However, few studies have quantitatively assessed the complex interrelationships between dietary and metabolic risk factors, their combined effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes, their associations with macro-socioeconomic variables, and their influence on global health disparities in the context of the epidemiologic transition. Scientific Objectives- 1) To study the inter- relationship between individual dietary and metabolic risk factors in the context of overall diet, 2) To develop sophisticated and robust analytical methods for quantifying the combined effects of diet and metabolic risks on CVD and diabetes, 3) To examine how dietary and metabolic risk factors are influenced by macro- socioeconomic factors such as urbanization, income inequality, and education, and 4) to evaluate how diet, metabolic risk factors, and their relationship to macro-socioeconomic factors contribute to health disparities globally. Scientific and Public Health Impact - This work will provide key insights into the relationships between diet, metabolic risk, and macro-socioeconomic determinants of health and their combined impacts on CVD and diabetes within the context of the global epidemiologic transition. In addition, this research will provide essential new knowledge on how differences in risk factor levels affect global disparities in CVD/diabetes mortality by gender, ethnicity, and age. This research will directly inform data-driven, targeted health policies and interventions to stem the rising epidemic of CVD and diabetes, and will develop new interdisciplinary computational methodologies for assessing the health effects of multiple risk factors. Career Objectives - My primary career objective is to become an independent researcher in a tenure-track faculty position conducting rigorous empirical work focused on understanding the drivers of the global CVD epidemic and developing strategies to prevent CVD and diabetes worldwide. Career Impact - The K99 phase of this award will allow me to spend focused time on professional development activities in a mentored environment to learn particular skills, such as grant writing, public speaking, developing networks of collaborators, and managing a research group that are indispensible in becoming an independent investigator. In addition, it will allow me the opportunity to take advanced courses and learn high-level research methods and substantive knowledge in nutritional, cardiovascular, and social epidemiology and biostatistics from my mentor and senior colleagues. This training will allow me to broaden and deepen the scope of my research, especially since my doctoral degree was in a different field. The R00 phase of this award will launch my career as an independent scientist in a tenure-track position in a research-oriented university, allowing me to establish my research program with high-quality analyses and publications, while securing additional grant support. Overall, the K99/R00 will have an invaluable impact on my scientific/professional transition to independence.

"Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive Trajectories and Brain Aging: Implications for Alzheimer's and Dementia Prevention ABSTRACT Vascular health has emerged as one of the most important determinants of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive

"Regulation of Platelet Reactivity by S1P Signaling The preeminent cause of morbidity and mortality in humans is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Race is considered to be an important determinant of the outcome of CVD since compared to whites, blacks have a twofold higher incidence of CVD even when other confounding factors are accounted for. Myocardial infarction and stroke result from formation of occlusive platelet thrombus at the site of atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Recently, Dr. Edelstein and colleagues have shown that differences in platelet reactivity to protease activated receptor 4-activating peptide (PAR4-AP) is heritable and is associated with racial disparity. They have identified two probable candidates, a variant of PAR4 protein (120A-T) and increased expression levels of phosphatidyl choline transfer protein (PCTP) to be contributing for the observed increase in platelet reactivity to PAR4-AP and ethnic differences seen. However, how these two independent proteins may regulate platelet reactivity to PAR4-AP is not well understood. We hypothesize that the hyperresponsive PAR4 variant associates with neutral sphingomyelinase (n-SMase), a key enzyme involved in synthesis of S1P, a potent bioactive lipid that binds to its receptor on the platelet surface to potentiate platelet reactivity. Enhanced levels of PCTP provide an increased amount of sphingomyelin (SM) required for S1P synthesis. Together, they enhanced recruitment of platelets in the growing thrombus thus influencing the outcome of CVD. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following three specific aims. Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the role of S1P synthetic pathway in influencing PAR4-induced signaling in platelets. We will evaluate if thrombin/PAR4-AP will differentially induce n-SMase activity as well as S1P levels in a PAR4 genotype specific manner. Next, we will determine if association of PAR4 with n-SMase is genotype specific and whether this association will influence association of PAR4 with Gαq. Furthermore, we will test if blockade of enzymes of S1P synthetic pathway and S1PR1/2 receptors for S1P on platelets will attenuate PAR4-AP-induced platelet function in PAR4 genotype dependent manner. We will also determine if genetic ablation of key enzymes of S1P synthesis using CRISPR/Cas9 technology in MEG-01 cells expressing PAR4 hyperreactive variant will rescue platelet hyperreactivity. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate the regulation of S1P synthesis in platelets by CIB1. It has been shown that CIB1 bind Sphk1/2 and regulate their activity in cells. We will first determine if Cib1 regulate thrombin-induced S1P synthesis using Cib1-/- mouse platelets. In Specific Aim 3, we will assess the role of platelet–derived S1P in regulation of thrombosis and transient ischemic stroke (tMCAO). We will evaluate if platelet specific deletion of Cib1 or inhibition of S1P signaling in mice expressing human PAR4 variants will differentially alter in vivo thrombotic and ischemic stroke outcomes. Since racial disparity in thrombosis and ischemic stroke has been well documented, our study may identify the factor responsible for this disparity and provide avenues for therapeutic intervention. Race is considered to be an important determinant of the outcome of CVD such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Platelet reactivity appears to play a central role in the racial disparity seen in CVD and controlling platelet activation is very important for combating CVD complications. It is particularly important to identify new targets for combating platelet reactivity to reduce disparity.",Regulation of Platelet Reactivity by S1P Signaling,9819309,R01HL142959,"['Affect ', ' Blood Platelets ', ' Thrombocytes ', ' Platelets ', ' Marrow platelet ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cell Body ', ' Cells ', ' Choline ', ' Enzyme Gene ', ' Enzymes ', ' Genotype ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Modern Man ', ' Human ', ' Hydrolysis ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' Mus ', ' heart infarction ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart attack ', ' coronary infarction ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Peptides ', ' Platelet Activation ', ' Platelet aggregation ', ' Play ', ' Production ', ' Proteins ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Race ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Rest ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' biological signal transduction ', ' Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction Systems ', ' Intracellular Communication and Signaling ', ' Cell Signaling ', ' Cell Communication and Signaling ', ' Signal Transduction ', ' Sphingomyelinase C ', ' Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase ', ' Sphingomyelin Cleaving Enzyme ', ' Sphingomyelin Cholinephosphohydrolase ', ' Sphingomyelinase ', ' Sphingomyelins ', ' 4-Sphingenine ', ' Sphingosine ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' fibrinogenase ', ' Thrombase ', ' Thrombin ', ' thrombotic disorder ', ' thrombotic disease ', ' Thrombosis ', ' Phosphatidylcholine Exchange Protein ', ' Lecithin Transfer Protein ', ' phosphatidylcholine transfer protein ', ' sphingosine 1-phosphate ', ' Generations ', ' Thrombus ', ' Site ', ' Surface ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' Link ', ' Thrombotic Stroke ', ' Binding Proteins ', ' bound protein ', ' Protein Binding ', ' Ligand Binding Protein Gene ', ' Ligand Binding Protein ', ' Genetic ', ' Attenuated ', ' Sphingosine-1-Phosphate Receptor ', ' S1P Receptor ', ' Edg Receptors ', ' Ablation ', ' Membrane ', ' membrane structure ', ' receptor ', ' Receptor Protein ', ' synthetic enzyme ', ' protease-activated receptor 4 ', ' coagulation factor II (thrombin) receptor-like 3 protein ', ' F2RL3 protein ', ' racial difference ', ' race differences ', ' ethnic difference ', ' ethnicity difference ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion ', ' Therapeutic Intervention ', ' intervention therapy ', ' Regulation ', ' Modeling ', ' Membrane Microdomains ', ' lipid raft ', ' Sphingolipid-Cholesterol Rafts ', ' Sphingolipid Microdomains ', ' Cell Membrane Lipid Rafts ', ' SPHK1 enzyme ', ' sphingosine kinase-1 ', ' Ischemic Stroke ', ' Lipid Binding ', ' lipid bound ', ' Integrin Binding ', ' integrin bound ', ' Molecular Interaction ', ' Binding ', ' PAWR gene ', ' par-4 ', ' PAWR ', ' PAR4 ', ' Defect ', ' Data ', ' in vivo ', ' Calcium Binding ', ' calcium bound ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' Outcome ', ' Heritability ', ' Impairment ', ' combat ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel druggable target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new druggable target ', ' new drug target ', ' racial disparity ', ' race disparity ', ' disparities in race ', ' CRISPR/Cas technology ', ' Cas nuclease technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 technology ', ' CRISPR/Cas9 ', ' CRISPR/Cas method ', ' CRISPR-based tool ', ' CRISPR-based technology ', ' CRISPR-based technique ', ' CRISPR-based method ', ' CRISPR-CAS-9 ', ' CRISPR technology ', ' CRISPR technique ', ' CRISPR methodology ', ' CRISPR method ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' recruit ', ' atherosclerotic plaque rupture ', ' stroke outcome ', ' platelet function ', ' ']",NHLBI,THOMAS JEFFERSON UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,523101,0.0013139704512211698
"REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke- Myocardial Infarction-3 Despite marked declines, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. To further decrease CHD, a better understanding of CHD risks and outcomes in the 21st century is needed in light of: 1) continued health disparities; 2) declining ST elevation myocardial infarctions (MI); 3) increasing sensitivity of troponin laboratory assays, increasing detection of very small and previously undetectable MI events; 4) wide use of statins and revascularization procedures, complicating population studies and risk prediction; 5) more people surviving their first MI; 6) increased emphasis on population health management and patient-centeredness. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort includes 30,239 community-dwelling white and black participants recruited in 2003-2007. In the previous 2 funding cycles, the REGARDS-MI ancillary study has produced >100 publications on racial disparities in CHD and identified novel CHD risk factors. The REGARDS parent and other ancillary studies have collected extensive phenotype, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, and patient-reported outcomes data, including linked Medicare data. A second in-home visit is nearing completion, providing patient-centered endpoints including quality of life up to 10 years following first MI. The availability of these novel data coupled with >10 years of follow-up for all participants offers a unique opportunity to study CHD among high-risk subpopulations, e.g., those with low socioeconomic status (SES), blacks, and older adults to identify strategies to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine the 10-year incidence of CHD and CVD (either CHD or stroke) and examine associations with traditional and emerging risk factors. CHD events will be adjudicated using the same rigorous methods used during the first 2 funding periods and combined with stroke events adjudicated through the parent REGARDS study. We will refine published CHD and CVD risk prediction models and assess emerging risk factors in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES) and by MI type (very small or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI). 2) Develop pragmatic strategies to identify high-risk subgroups that could be targeted for interventions to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. We will calculate population attributable risks and numbers of events potentially averted through population shifts in risk factor distributions. 3) Determine the rates of, and risk factors for, recurrent CHD events, heart failure (HF), and mortality after first adjudicated MI (including very small, or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI) or coronary revascularization procedure, overall, and in subgroups (e.g., type of CHD event, age, race, sex, and SES). 4) Using data from the 2nd in- home visit, describe patient-centered outcomes (functional status, depressive symptoms, stress, cognitive functioning, quality of life), HF, secondary prevention, and risk factor management up to 10 years after first adjudicated MI , overall and in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES). We will extend the REGARDS-MI study for another 4 years in order to expand the number of coronary heart disease events to over 1800 (currently 1000) and to extend follow-up to a full 10 years on all 30,239 black and white cohort members. This will permit our well-established team to conduct studies to inform population health management and the elimination of health disparities in the 21st century, both in the cohort overall, and among high-risk subgroups.",REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke- Myocardial Infarction-3,9685200,R01HL080477,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', ' later life ', ' late life ', ' geriatric ', ' elders ', ' advanced age ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Bioassay ', ' Assay ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' coronary disorder ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Discrimination ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Food ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Medicare ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Heart failure ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Incidence ', ' Ischemia ', ' Laboratories ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Light ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Levels of trimethylamine metabolites and their associations with dietary intakes and cardiometabolic biomarkers: the TMAO Pooling Project PROJECT SUMMARY  There is a growing appreciation that diet-gut microbiota interactions play an important role in human cardiovascular health. Recent studies have discovered a diet-derived, gut microbiota-dependent metabolite, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which may promote the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). So far, only a few small studies among general populations have investigated this novel TMAO-CVD pathway. Limited evidence suggests that TMAO production and metabolism is influenced by both dietary and non-dietary factors, and that the diet-TMAO association may vary across populations due to significant variations in TMAO food sources (e.g., meat vs. fish vs. plant foods). Large-scale, collaborative epidemiologic studies that include ethnically and regionally diverse populations and incorporate comprehensive data on diet, TMAO metabolites, and CVD biomarkers will provide critical insights into this meta-organismal pathway and may pave the way for developing new strategies for CVD prevention and treatment based on diet-gut microbiota interactions.  We propose to conduct a large, international, collaborative study: the TMAO Pooling Project. It will be primarily based on the newly established Consortium of Metabolomics Studies (COMETS) and will also include several other population-based studies. As of Oct. 2017, we have recruited 18 studies from the US, Europe, and Asia, bringing a total of 44,164 participants, including 51% women and 46% understudied racial/ethnic groups (i.e., blacks, Hispanic/Latinos, and Asians). Our Specific Aims are: 1) to examine distributions of TMAO and related metabolites (i.e., choline, carnitine, and betaine) across populations by age, sex, region, race/ethnicity, obesity, smoking status, and metabolic disease status; 2) to evaluate associations of TMAO metabolites with intakes of trimethylamine-containing foods including potential variations across populations; and 3) to evaluate associations of TMAO metabolites with known CVD biomarkers (e.g., glucose, blood lipids, and inflammatory markers). We hypothesize that TMAO level may differ across populations due to variations in habitual diets and metabolic disease status, which in turn may affect CVD health in these populations.  This will be the first, large-scale, multi-ethnic, multi-national metabolomics study that leverages existing data and consortium resources to investigate this novel diet-TMAO-CVD pathway. It is feasible and extremely time- and cost-efficient. Knowledge gained will help elucidate the distribution, influencing factors, and potential effects of TMAO on CVD. This study will lay a foundation for future studies on the role of diet-gut microbiota interactions in the development of CVD among diverse populations, which may eventually lead to new, population-specific strategies for CVD prevention and treatment via dietary and/or gut microbial modifications. Meanwhile, this study will establish a network for collaborations on emerging topics in CVD research such as gut microbiota, metabolomics, and health disparities, and will foster career development of junior investigators in these areas as they collaborate and learn from senior investigators and their peers. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is a dietary-gut microbial metabolite and a promising novel biomarker for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We propose to conduct a collaborative pooled analysis to examine levels of TMAO and a few related metabolites across populations and their associations with dietary intakes and established CVD biomarkers.

"Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans ABSTRACT  This mixed-methods study utilizes a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets and qualitative data collection, to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion and Spirituality (R/S) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk factors. CVD risk factors, especially high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and depression, disproportionately affect African Americans in prevalence and/or severity, contributing to the higher associated mortality rate. Further, examining lifestyle choices (for example, diet and exercise) without appropriate sociocultural context does not provide practice-ready solutions on the manifestations, root causes and potential strategies for eliminating African American’s heightened CVD risks. As such, religion and spirituality (R/S) in the African American community have been acknowledged for their positive influence on social behaviors and emotional health, but have not been sufficiently examined for their role in attenuating or exacerbating physical health outcomes and in particular, the risks associated with CVD. Most research has compared the relationship between R/S and health outcomes by examining the specific denominations of their White participants, and blanketed Black participants’ religion to the “Black Church.” This approach disregards the diversity of beliefs, behaviors and ways of thinking found in the religious affiliation and denominations of African Americans. In a rare project that examined Black health outcomes in relation to specific religious affiliation/denomination, it was revealed that religious attendance had an inverse relationship based upon religious affiliation/denomination on black mortality rates not found in white participants. Thus, the standard of relying on religious affiliation and health studies based on White participants to determine expected outcomes for Black participants is likely to cause inaccuracies in research and interventions. The overarching goals of this research are to investigate the extent to which R/S is related to CVD risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression) through the use of robust secondary and primary data analysis. The two project Aims will use theoretically-, research- and data-driven evidence to bolster efforts to decrease CVD risk factors and improve health outcomes for African Americans. Aim 1 utilizes structural equational modeling to determine if R/S has direct and indirect effects on CVD risk factors through health behaviors. Aim 2 establishes how the relationships manifest through first-hand accounts of the attributes of specific denominations on the health outcomes of its congregants, thus allowing participants to explain how the relationships found in Aim 1 are manifested-or not, in their daily and R/S life. The purpose of this research project is to not only identify the direct and indirect relationships between CVD risk factors and R/S, but to provide in depth knowledge of core attitudes, beliefs, organizational structures, and/or practices that facilitate or attenuate positive health outcomes for African Americans. The precision and nuance of our project’s strategies will fill in significant gaps in research and practice that can be a catalyst for evidence-based interventions that examines of community and religious institutions to support positive health outcomes for African American. Project Narrative The proposed mixed-methods study will utilize a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets (Add Health, National Survey of American Life and the Jackson Heart Study) and qualitative primary data collection to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion/Spirituality (R/S) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors- including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression for African Americans, while considering religious affiliation/denomination. Our strategy will fill in significant gaps in public research and effective community and religious based interventions by providing specific and nuanced data that can help build accuracy and researcher- participant trust. Considering R/S and CVD risk factors, Aim 1 addresses what relationships are there using secondary data analysis and Aim 2 establishes how the findings in Aim 1 are manifested (or not) through interviews and focus groups with African American community members and religious leaders and congregants.","Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans",9710363,R01MD011606,"['Affect ', ' Age Factors ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Communities ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Analysis ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' depression ', ' Mental Depression ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' high blood pressure ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Hypertension ', ' Incidence ', ' Economical Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Income ', ' Interview ', ' life course ', ' Life Cycle ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' obese population ', ' obese person ', ' obese people ', ' obese ', ' corpulentia ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulence ', ' adiposity ', ' Obesity ', ' Religion ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Social Behavior ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Socialization ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Surveys ', ' thoughts ', ' Thinking ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variant ', ' Variation ', ' caucasian American ', ' white American ', ' Spirituality ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Trust ', ' Protestant ', ' Plant Roots ', ' root ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' physical conditioning ', ' physical health ', ' Equation ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' religious group ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' religious ', ' Categories ', ' organizational structure ', ' Organization Charts ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' informant ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community setting ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' Add Health ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2019,567229,0.21325356453542021
"Impact of Interventions on Future Trends in Subnational Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases in the US PROJECT SUMMARY Geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) – the leading cause of death in the U.S. – remain large. Since 2010, CVD death rates are no longer declining in many states, and for some groups, mortality is increasing. Reduction in CVD disparities is a major stated goal of U.S. health policy, but national-level strategies, such as Healthy People 2020 and the Million Hearts campaign, do not directly address these large geographic differences in CVD between states. The U.S. is rich in local health data, yet it is poorly integrated, so there is little evidence available to guide states or local health systems when selecting among primary prevention interventions and policies. Health policy models are an important way to integrate complex patterns of risk exposure and disease burden with other population trends including income, education, aging, migration, and health care access. Previous CVD forecasts and policy models have produced only single geography – primarily national – estimates, which cannot provide the evidence needed to address geographic disparities. The overarching goal for this study will be: a systematic analysis of why CVD patterns vary by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and state in the U.S.; how this variation will lead to future divergence in CVD mortality rates; and the variable impact that similar risk reduction strategies will then have on different U.S. states. For this work, we will adapt econometric, geospatial, and epidemiologic modelling methods by leveraging the large data and computational resources of the Global Burden of Disease Study. Aim 1 is a CVD population health projection that will estimate future burden of CVD for each U.S. state by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Using observed past trends in CVD and major modifiable causal risk factors, we will project health loss due to CVD, including disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), through 2040 for each U.S. state. We will integrate multiple sources of existing health surveillance data with the results of state-level health examination surveys. Estimates will be produced separately by sex and 5-year age groups, for four collectively exhaustive race/ethnicity categories for CVD overall, and separately for ischemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, aortic aneurysm, and chronic kidney disease. Aim 2 is a new set of CVD health policy models that estimate the impact within each state of interventions shown to improve the delivery of pharmacotherapies that lower blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol. Aim 3 is a new set of CVD health policy models that estimate the impact of behavioral interventions shown to reduce CVD risk factors. Projections and policy models for CVD are a necessary step in reducing U.S. health disparities. Our results will be able to guide local decision-makers considering a range of policy options to reduce the burden of CVD. We will then implement a broad dissemination plan designed to expand the impact of our work beyond academic audiences, providing webinars, policy reports, and outreach to health departments and other stakeholders actively engaged in policy work in key states. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is a systematic analysis of why the burden of cardiovascular diseases vary by race/ethnicity and state in the U.S., the extent to which this variation will lead to future divergence in mortality rates, and the variable impact that similar risk reduction strategies will have on different U.S. states. This project will build on the data and computational infrastructure of the Global Burden of Disease Study to: a) produce a new set of population health projections stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, estimating the trajectory of cardiovascular diseases for the next 20 years in each U.S. state, and b) develop new health policy models that allow each state to examine the local impact of a broad range of interventions that improve cardiometabolic health. The results of this project will provide new evidence on the impact of interventions tailored to each U.S. state, allowing policymakers to improve their selection of policies that can reduce

"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS:

"Apolipoprotein-C Proteoforms in Dyslipidemia and Cardiovascular Disease Abstract Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk. Although apoC-III is typically measured as total plasma apoC-III concentration, it is present in blood in several post-translational proteoforms - with the most abundant forms containing zero, one or two sialic acid molecules. However, the relationships between apoC-III proteoforms and patterns of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk are largely unknown. We found that higher relative amounts of apoC-III with two sialic acids (but not 0 or 1) were linked in cross-sectional and prospective studies with lower triglyceride levels, and were associated with reduced risk for CVD events. Our data also indicate ratios of these proteoforms may vary with race and lipid-lowering therapies and that proteoforms of both apoC-I and C-II also demonstrate unique relationships with blood lipid concentrations. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a large community based cohort study of CVD risk factors, subclinical measures of atherosclerosis and determinants of major CVD events. Importantly, the diverse ethnic and racial population within the study will permit a definitive study of these proteoforms and their relationships with lipid abnormalities, atherosclerosis and CVD events while exploring ethnic/racial differences. The present proposal will utilize a novel mass spectrometry immunoassay (MSIA) to investigate the relationships of apoC-III (and secondarily apo-CI and C-II) proteoforms with plasma lipid concentrations, progression of vascular calcification and carotid atherosclerosis, and development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within the MESA cohort. Total plasma apoC-III concentrations and apoC-III relative proteoform amounts will be determined by MSIA in baseline and 10-year follow-up plasma samples. Aim 1 will examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between apoC-III measures and plasma lipids. Aim 2 will determine whether apoC-III measures predict baseline atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis progression evaluated from CT scans of coronary arteries and ultrasonography-derived carotid-intima-media thickness measured during MESA. Aim 3 will determine the relationship between apoC-III measures and incident MACE and total CVD events. This will be the first large study evaluating relationships between apoC proteoforms and CVD risk. As therapies are now being developed to specifically target apoC proteins to reduce triglycerides and CVD risk, a more definitive understanding of the complexity and clinical implications of the apoC family of proteins is needed. As diabetes and lipid-lowering therapies appear to have differential effects on apoC proteoforms, targeting therapy to specific proteoforms and/or subsets of individuals may be beneficial. As we have demonstrated that there are proteoforms of many other plasma proteins, this study may also help highlight the broader value of identifying variations in post-translational protein structure and their functional differences. Narrative The present proposal will utilize a novel mass spectrometry immunoassay to investigate the relationships of apolipoprotein CIII (apoC-III) post-translational variants (proteoforms) with plasma lipid concentrations, progression of vascular calcification and carotid atherosclerosis, and development of major adverse cardiovascular events within the MESA community based cohort. This study will provide a definitive understanding of the complexity and clinical implications of the apoC family of proteins, and may help guide current and future therapies directed towards lowering apoC-III and triglycerides. As we have demonstrated that there are proteoforms of many other plasma proteins, this study may also help highlight the broader value of identifying variations in post-translational protein structure

"Estrogen-Mediated Impairments of Vascular Health in Diabetes Diabetes has recently been referred to as “the epidemic of the 21st century” and contributes to a substantial economic burden on the United States public health. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 80% of morbidity and mortality in diabetes, however, women with type 1 diabetes have a substantially greater risk for CVD compared to men with diabetes. A critical barrier to understanding this sexual dimorphism in CVD risk is the lack of knowledge regarding the role of estrogen (E2) on vascular health in diabetic women. Oxidative stress is a common phenotype in patients with diabetes and is routinley associated with hyperglycemia and diabetic complications. In addition, sirtuin1 (Sirt1) has been proposed to play a fundemental role in regulating nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and is lower in patients with diabetes. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that an elevated concentration of E2 in women with type 1 diabetes contributes to a reduction in NO- bioavailability and vascular health through two separate pathways; an increase in oxidative stress and a decrease in circulating Sirt1. In support, compelling preliminary data indicate that the natural increase in vascular health from menses to the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle is lost in the presence of type 1 diabetes. In addition, this loss is associated with increased oxidative stress and lower Sirt1. To investigate the impact of E2 on vascular health in women with diabetes, we propose to utilize the menstrual cycle as a natural and novel method to investigate changes in sex-steroid hormones. We will perform a comprehensive assessment of vascular health in men and at two different times during the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women with and without type 1 diabetes: 1) during the menses (low estrogen/low progesterone) and 2) late follicular (elevated estrogen/low progesterone) phases. In addition, we will employ two novel treatments that may mitigate future CVD risk in patients with diabetes. Findings will not only contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with sex disparities of CVD risk in diabetes, they may identify novel therapeutic approaches to decrease estrogen-mediated vascular dysfunction in women with diabetes. This proposal demonstrates the true model of translational research and represents a major shift in the approach to understanding the sexual dimorphism of CVD risk in patients with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes has recently been referred to as “the epidemic of the 21st century”. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 80% of diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality and women with type 1 diabetes suffer substantially more risk for CVD compared to men with diabetes. However, the reason for this sex-disparity in CVD risk is unknown. Findings from this proposal will not only uncover circulating levels of estrogen throughout the menstrual cycle as a contributor of poor vascular health, it will identify 2 potential therapeutic treatment options to improve blood vessel function in patients with type 1 diabetes.",Estrogen-Mediated Impairments of Vascular Health in Diabetes,9634969,R01HL137087,"['Aftercare ', ' post treatment ', ' After-Treatment ', ' After Care ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Ascorbic Acid ', ' Vitamin C ', ' VIT C ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' circulatory system ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' diabetes ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Experimental Diabetes ', ' Experimental Diabetes Mellitus ', ' type one diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1DM ', ' T1D ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1 DM ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Endothelium ', ' Epidemic ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Estrogens ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Preovulatory Phase ', ' Menstrual Proliferative Phase ', ' Follicular Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Follicular Phase ', ' proliferative phase Menstrual cycle ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' indexing ', ' iontophoresis therapy ', ' Drug Iontophoresis ', ' Iontophoresis ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Lasers ', ' alpha-Lipoic Acid ', ' Lipoic Acid ', ' 1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid ', ' Thioctic Acid ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Menstrual cycle ', ' monthly period ', ' menstrual period ', ' Menses ', ' Menstruation ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity -

"Using agent-based modeling to compare strategies that can reduce rural-urban disparities in cardiovascular disease Project Summary Rural-urban disparities in mortality attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) have widened in the United States during the past several decades. The complex interplay of preventive health care delivery and community-level behavioral and contextual factors contribute to the differences in cardiovascular health between rural and urban residents. Recently, systems science and simulation modeling have played an important role in the evaluation, selection, and implementation of evidence-based interventions. However, existing models do not account for either the specific characteristics of populations living in rural communities, or the health care services and other contextual factors of these communities. We propose to use agent-based modeling -- a systems science approach that incorporates data from various sources and simulates real-world clinical or community settings -- to help disentangle these complexities, elucidate causal pathways, and identify potentially effective interventions in rural communities. Our long-term goal is to find effective clinical and public health solutions to reduce rural-urban disparities in cardiovascular health among rural communities in Georgia and New York. Taking an integrated preventive health care and community perspective, we will accomplish our specific aims using an agent-based model of community-based CVD prevention and test the effectiveness of the following interventions at the rural county level. First, we will estimate the health impact of improving health care delivery and access using home-based telemonitoring programs and expanding insurance coverage, focusing on three major CVD risk factors: hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol (Aim 1). Second, we will estimate the health impact of public health interventions, including improving the food environment, community-based health promotion, and increasing tobacco taxes for reducing four important lifestyle factors related with CVD: obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and smoking (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will use the CVD Policy Model, a well- validated US population-based CVD epidemiology simulation model and translate projected beneficial effects on the seven risk factors and lifestyles tested in Aim 1 and 2 into downstream impact on CVD events. This will allow us to assess the potential of these individual or combined interventions on rural-urban disparities in the incidence and mortality of CVD and direct medical costs at the state level. The proposed research is innovative because we develop a policy simulation model to inform decision-making for health care and public health management of CVD in rural counties, integrating clinical with community systems to find the most effective evidence-based intervention. Project Narrative As the consequence of rural-urban health disparities in cardiovascular disease risk factors, the US rural population suffers a disproportionately higher prevalence, mortality and economic burden of cardiovascular disease than the urban population. This simulation analysis study will test and compare evidence-based clinical or public health interventions and identify those interventions that promise to narrow the gaps in cardiovascular health between rural and urban residents in Georgia and New York.",Using agent-based modeling to compare strategies that can reduce rural-urban disparities in cardiovascular

"Informing Cardiovascular Disease Prevention among Rural Appalachian Women: A Community-Engaged Mixed Method Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In Appalachia, a largely rural and low socioeconomic status region, premature mortality rates are 25 percent higher than all US counties.1,2 Appalachian populations have significantly higher rates of heart disease mortality compared to national averages,3 including high rates for women.4,5 With high proportions of uncontrolled risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD),6-8 the need for strategies to increase CVD screening rates among rural Appalachian women is a public health priority.9 A comprehensive exploration of the complex and interconnected barriers and facilitators for CVD preventative screenings is required to better understand decision-making.10,11 Recommended screening for CVD covers physiologic tests (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure) and self-reported behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity).12,13 However, the completion and follow-up from screenings by rural Appalachian women remains low.11 This research builds upon available Appalachian disparity research, which suggests a range of interconnected factors combine to affect screening decision-making by rural Appalachian women.14-27 As a gap exists between knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs and screening behavior,17,20,26 this mixed method study consists of context-specific strategies to uncover interconnections between individual, social, and environmental levels and to inform interventions to increase CVD preventative screenings by rural Appalachian women.17,18 Through a novel community-engaged mixed method approach of combining spatial analysis and concept mapping, this research aims to: 1) Assess the association of county-level resource distribution and cardiovascular health outcomes for women to identify varying patterns among the rural Appalachian counties of PA and 2) Identify community perceptions of the range of barriers and facilitators to the receipt of preventive CVD screenings by rural Appalachian women. The proposed study will inform the Healthy People 2020 goal to assess health disparities in relation to demographic factors such as gender, SES, and geographic location28 and will address NHLBI’s critical challenges to further explore sex/gender-specificity in research and to advance methods for characterizing exposures to understand differences in health among populations.29 To facilitate this research, I will undertake educational and training opportunities to develop skills and knowledge in: 1) CVD prevention among women, 2) spatial analysis, 3) concept mapping methodology, 4) the role of environmental and community-level factors that affect rural women’s health in the Appalachian region, and 5) expand skills in action-oriented research with community partners. I will conduct the proposed research with support from a dedicated and multi-disciplinary mentorship team in a resource-rich environment at the University of Pittsburgh. Upon successful completion of this fellowship, I will be well-poised to meet my long-term goals of attaining a faculty position and having an independent scientific research career in chronic disease prevention, health disparities, and community-based research with specialties in rural and female Appalachian populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will enhance the understanding of the complex and interconnected factors affecting the receipt of cardiovascular disease preventative screenings by women in the Appalachian region. Through a novel community-engaged mixed method approach combining spatial analysis and concept mapping, this study will identify individual, social, and environmental factors to address in future population-based interventions to contribute to increased health equity for rural Appalachian women in cardiovascular disease outcomes.",Informing Cardiovascular Disease Prevention among Rural Appalachian Women: A Community-Engaged Mixed Method Study,9782736,F31HL143871,"['Affect ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachian ', ' Appalachia ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Communities ', ' conceptual processes ', ' Concept Formation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Death ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' geographic site ', ' Geographical Location ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' heart disorder ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Smoking ', ' social support network ', ' Social support ', ' Specialty ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specificity ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' brain attack ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Stroke ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Wood ', ' Wood material ', ' County ', ' Gender ', ' Female Health ', "" Women's Health "", ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' base ', ' career ', ' density ', ' rural area ', ' rural region ', ' improved ', ' Physiological ', ' Physiologic ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' CVD prevention ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disorder prevention ', ' disease prevention ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' social ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low SES ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Data ', ' sex ', ' follow-up ', ' followup ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' active followup ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' NHLBI ', ' health literacy ', ' Preventive screening ', ' Preventative screening ', ' self reported behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based participatory research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based research ', ' community based design ', ' lens ', ' lenses ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' public health priorities ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' concept mapping ', ' concept maps ', ' training opportunity ', ' Preventive care ', ' Preventative care ', ' health difference ', ' differences in health ', ' rural dwellers ', ' rural resident ', ' screening participation ', ' screening guidelines ', ' screening recommendations ', ' recommended screening ', ' Rural Appalachia ', ' Rural Appalachian ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2019,45016,0.14083516399944027
"Impact of multilevel risk and resilience factors on cardiovascular health in racially/ethnically diverse men and women Project Summary/Abstract In the US, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death. African Americans (AAs), low- socioeconomic position (SEP) groups, southerners, and Hispanics are impacted disproportionately by CVD. In addition, compared to women, men have earlier onset of CVD and have had higher death rates attributable to CVD. These sex differences and racial/ethnic and SEP disparities are setbacks to achieving national health equity and CVD reduction goals. To reduce differences and disparities in CVD, it is critical to improve cardiovascular (CV) health. A 2015 AHA statement indicated that “the most significant opportunity” to improve CV health and reduce CVD lies in addressing the social determinants of health. Such determinants include psychosocial risks (e.g., racism, discrimination, and low SEP) operating at multiple levels. Emerging research indicates that resilience resources at the individual, interpersonal, and neighborhood levels may protect CV health in the face of multilevel psychosocial risks via indirect effects such as more positive health behaviors and buffering effects of psychosocial risks on physiological functioning. Resilience resources are defined as positive adaptation and display of positive behaviors/outcomes despite adversity. Compared to multilevel psychosocial risks, multilevel resilience resources represent novel and potentially more malleable intervention targets. Despite growing evidence supporting the protective effects of resilience resources on CV outcomes, critical research gaps remain. For example, the majority of resilience research has not been conducted with disparity populations, populations free of CVD, included multilevel psychosocial risks, or tested for differences between sex and racial/ethnic groups. Thus, the objective of this proposal is to examine if multilevel resilience resources are associated with CV outcomes and if multilevel psychosocial risks moderate these relationships. Specifically, longitudinal data on racially/ethnically diverse men and women enrolled in three CV health cohorts (i.e., JHS, MESA, MASALA) will be harmonized to create an integrated dataset. Using the integrated data we aim to: (a) determine whether the most reliable and valid measures of multilevel risk and multilevel resilience resources demonstrate measurement invariance across sex and diverse racial/ethnic groups; (b) determine if multilevel resilience resources are associated with ideal CV health over time and if multilevel psychosocial risks moderate observed relationships; (c) determine if multilevel resilience resources are prospectively associated with incident CVD events over time and if multilevel psychosocial risks moderate observed relationships; and (d) quantify the degree to which hypothetical interventions designed to build multilevel resilience resources reduce racial/ethnic and sex differences in ideal CV health and CVD events overall and by the level of multilevel psychosocial risks. This project responds to the NIH-wide, NHLBI, OBSSR, and AHA calls to fill critical gaps in psychosocial risk, resilience, and CV outcomes research. Project Narrative This innovative project will: (a) determine whether multilevel resilience resources are associated with cardiovascular (CV) outcomes (i.e., ideal CV health and incident CV disease); (b) quantify the impacts of hypothetical multilevel resilience resource building interventions on racial/ethnic disparities and sex differences in CV outcomes; and (c) examine the degree to which the aforementioned relationships/impacts are moderated by multilevel psychosocial risks. This work will be conducted using longitudinal data on racially/ethnically diverse men and women enrolled in three United States-based CV health cohorts (i.e., JHS, MESA, MASALA) that will be harmonized to create an integrated dataset.

"REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke- Myocardial Infarction-3 Despite marked declines, coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the US. To further decrease CHD, a better understanding of CHD risks and outcomes in the 21st century is needed in light of: 1) continued health disparities; 2) declining ST elevation myocardial infarctions (MI); 3) increasing sensitivity of troponin laboratory assays, increasing detection of very small and previously undetectable MI events; 4) wide use of statins and revascularization procedures, complicating population studies and risk prediction; 5) more people surviving their first MI; 6) increased emphasis on population health management and patient-centeredness. The REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) cohort includes 30,239 community-dwelling white and black participants recruited in 2003-2007. In the previous 2 funding cycles, the REGARDS-MI ancillary study has produced >100 publications on racial disparities in CHD and identified novel CHD risk factors. The REGARDS parent and other ancillary studies have collected extensive phenotype, cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor, and patient-reported outcomes data, including linked Medicare data. A second in-home visit is nearing completion, providing patient-centered endpoints including quality of life up to 10 years following first MI. The availability of these novel data coupled with >10 years of follow-up for all participants offers a unique opportunity to study CHD among high-risk subpopulations, e.g., those with low socioeconomic status (SES), blacks, and older adults to identify strategies to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. Our Specific Aims are to: 1) Determine the 10-year incidence of CHD and CVD (either CHD or stroke) and examine associations with traditional and emerging risk factors. CHD events will be adjudicated using the same rigorous methods used during the first 2 funding periods and combined with stroke events adjudicated through the parent REGARDS study. We will refine published CHD and CVD risk prediction models and assess emerging risk factors in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES) and by MI type (very small or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI). 2) Develop pragmatic strategies to identify high-risk subgroups that could be targeted for interventions to optimize population health while simultaneously eliminating health disparities. We will calculate population attributable risks and numbers of events potentially averted through population shifts in risk factor distributions. 3) Determine the rates of, and risk factors for, recurrent CHD events, heart failure (HF), and mortality after first adjudicated MI (including very small, or `microsize' MI, and type 2 MI) or coronary revascularization procedure, overall, and in subgroups (e.g., type of CHD event, age, race, sex, and SES). 4) Using data from the 2nd in- home visit, describe patient-centered outcomes (functional status, depressive symptoms, stress, cognitive functioning, quality of life), HF, secondary prevention, and risk factor management up to 10 years after first adjudicated MI , overall and in subgroups (e.g., age, race, sex, and SES). We will extend the REGARDS-MI study for another 4 years in order to expand the number of coronary heart disease events to over 1800 (currently 1000) and to extend follow-up to a full 10 years on all 30,239 black and white cohort members. This will permit our well-established team to conduct studies to inform population health management and the elimination of health disparities in the 21st century, both in the cohort overall, and among high-risk subgroups.",REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke- Myocardial Infarction-3,9910226,R01HL080477,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Atrial Fibrillation ', ' Auricular Fibrillation ', ' Biological Assay ', ' Assay ', ' Bioassay ', ' Biologic Assays ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' Coronary heart disease ', ' Coronary Disease ', ' atherosclerotic heart disease ', ' coronary disorder ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Food ', ' Food or Food Product ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Medicare ', ' Health Insurance for Aged and Disabled, Title 18 ', ' Health Insurance for Disabled Title 18 ', ' Title 18 ', ' health insurance for disabled ', ' Heart failure ', ' cardiac failure ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Incidence ', ' Ischemia ', ' Laboratories ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity -

"The effect of insufficient sleep on cardiovascular disease disparity between blacks and whites Project Summary/Abstract Background: Blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD), CVD risk markers (elevated blood pressure, cholesterol, and unhealthy glucose levels), and CVD mortality, compared to whites. Despite advances in understanding how CVD disparity is engendered and preventing CVD, blacks compared to whites are still disproportionately burdened by CVD, particularly CVD risk markers. Therefore, more novel targets that drive racial disparity in CVD risk markers must be investigated in order to reduce and eliminate CVD disparity. Evidence indicating that insufficient sleep (sleep duration ≤6hrs/24 hr. cycle), which disproportionately affects blacks, is linked to concurrent and future CVD risk may offer a potentially novel mechanism explaining CVD risk disparity between blacks and whites. However, it is unclear whether insufficient sleep directly or indirectly drives disparity in CVD risk between blacks and whites? Therefore, the purpose of the proposed K01 study is to investigate whether insufficient sleep independently explains a significant portion of racial disparity in CVD risk markers, while adjusting for the confounding effects of sleep apnea and insomnia (two sleep disorders that cause insufficient sleep). Additionally, since 55% of insufficient sleepers are obese and blacks are twice as likely to be obese compared to whites, the candidate will investigate the independent and combined effects of insufficient sleep and obesity on the disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Research: In the proposed K01, the candidate, Dr. Azizi Seixas, will investigate: 1) whether insufficient sleep and/or obesity play an important role in the relationship between race/ethnicity and CVD risk, controlling for sleep apnea and insomnia; and 2) what sleep duration and body mass index profile is associated with lowest probability of CVD risk among blacks and whites, using advanced mathematical analytic methods and complex system simulation modeling. Training: The training plan builds upon the candidate's background and experience in conducting research in sleep disorders and cardiovascular disease (e.g. hypertension and stroke), among minority populations. During the K01, the candidate will receive training in sleep science and physiology, cardiovascular disease and advanced analytical, machine learning, and simulation modeling. He will perform secondary analyses of data from the Sleep Heart Health Study, a NHLBI-funded study. The pedagogical approach includes one-on-one mentorship, course work, mentored laboratory training (practicum), and attendance to targeted conferences and seminars, with the common goal of supporting his transition to being an independent scientist. Project Narrative The overarching objective of this K01 career development award is to foster the transition of Dr. Azizi Seixas into an independent scientist in the area of sleep and cardiovascular disease and health disparities. The proposed study will investigate a novel mechanism underlying associations between insufficient sleep, obesity, and disparity in CVD risk markers between blacks and whites. Findings from the study will be the basis of sleep and obesity interventions to reduce CVD risk, especially among diverse groups burdened by cardiovascular disease.",The effect of insufficient sleep

"Preterm birth and long-term risk of cardiovascular disease in mothers and offspring Currently about 1 of every 10 births in the US occurs preterm (gestational age <37 completed weeks), and because of advances in treatment, >95% of preterm infants survive to adulthood. Recent research has shown that both the mothers and offspring of preterm birth (PTB) have higher long-term risks of metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Mothers who deliver preterm may also have higher long- term CVD incidence; however, the reported risks of CVD in adult offspring of PTB have been conflicting. A recent Trans-NIH Working Group highlighted a pressing need for studies that: (1) stratify long-term CVD risks by PTB subtype (e.g., spontaneous vs. indicated due to maternal/fetal conditions) to help elucidate underlying mechanisms and tailor long-term patient care; (2) allow longer follow-up into mid-adulthood or later when disease risks remain poorly understood; and (3) include large sample sizes to allow examination of long-term outcomes with high statistical power. We hypothesize that: (1) PTB is associated with higher long-term risks of CVD (i.e., ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, aortic disease) among mothers and adult offspring, with increasing dose-response relationships by earlier gestational age; and (2) These associations exist for all major types of PTB, but are stronger for those related to placental insufficiency (e.g., preeclampsia or diabetes), which is associated with oxidative stress and inflammation, leading to structural microvascular changes. To address these hypotheses, we propose to conduct the first comprehensive examination of PTB and its subtypes in relation to CVD risks among mothers and their adult offspring. We will assemble and analyze national databases containing all ~2.3 million births to ~1.2 million mothers in Sweden during 1973-1995 and all inpatient and outpatient diagnoses of CVD through 2015. Our specific aims are to: (1) Examine PTB and its subtypes in relation to long-term risks of CVD and CVD-related outcomes (hypertension, diabetes, sleep apnea) in mothers and adult offspring; (2) determine if there are sociodemographic subgroups that are more susceptible to PTB effects on long-term risks; and (3) explore potential confounding effects of unmeasured familial (genetic and shared environmental) factors on PTB-CVD associations using co-relative analyses. The proposed research is significant because PTB is common and unprecedented numbers of survivors are now reaching adulthood (~400,000/year in the US); thus even modestly increased long-term risks translate into a large population health burden. It is innovative because it will provide the first comprehensive examination of PTB and its subtypes in relation to CVD risks, and use a co-relative design to disentangle familial confounding. It is highly cost-efficient because we will assemble these data from national registries that are unavailable or prohibitively costly to collect in the US. The results will have major impacts by establishing the long-term CVD risks associated with PTB and its subtypes among mothers and adult offspring, and informing clinical guidelines for better risk assessment and long-term care. NARRATIVE Preterm birth (PTB) is common and may be linked with higher risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the mothers and offspring. The proposed research will provide the first comprehensive examination of PTB and its subtypes in relation to long-term risks of CVD among mothers and their adult offspring, using large-scale cohort data. The results will have major impacts by informing clinical guidelines for better risk assessment, anticipatory screening, and long-term patient care.",Preterm birth and long-term risk of cardiovascular

"Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data SUMMARY Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and is largely considered preventable by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Lipid-lowering therapy is the current mainstay of preventative treatment for ASCVD and guidelines for pharmacotherapy rely on the 2013 Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) for estimating 10-year risk. While these equations have been validated at a population level they have significant shortcomings that impact real-world patient-level effectiveness. These include implementation (i.e. time and effort for clinicians to enter patient data into a phone or web-based calculator), therapy changing sensitivity to highly variable inputs (e.g single time point blood pressure), paradoxical risk estimation for some patient subgroups that are an artifact of linear modeling (e.g. women smokers), blunt treatment of race (i.e. separately derived equations for black patients), and poor calibration for modern cohorts (i.e. resulting in the overestimation of risk). This project will attempt to address these shortcomings. First, portable tools for analyzing electronic health records found within the Rhode Island Health Information Exchange (HIE) will be developed for the extraction of PCE risk factors to enable the automated calculation of ASCVD risk. PCE risk factor extraction permutations (e.g. last vs mean blood pressure) will be optimized and the equations will be calibrated for the population. Next, EHR-system agnostic tools for extracting additional risk factors available within the medical record including symptom development, social determinants of health, and family history will be developed. PCE and non-PCE risk factors will be used for artificial neural network and dynamic Bayesian network modeling of ASCVD risk phenotype clusters to augment PCE risk prediction. Finally, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotype data derived ASCVD genetic risk score will be integrated with the HIE derived risk factors to demonstrate the potential clinical implications of implementing an omics-integrated learning healthcare system. The project will serve as foundational training for the principal investigator towards pursuing a career as a physician-scientist in the field of biomedical informatics. Hypothesis: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk estimation is central to current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. This project will test the hypothesis that population-level data-driven methods will improve the accuracy of risk calculators. Aim 1: Determine the Predictive Performance of PCE Risk Factors Derived from Longitudinal HIE Data Aim 2: Define Population-Based ASCVD Risk Phenotype Clusters Aim 3: Demonstrate HIE-Omics-Integrated Learning Healthcare System with Direct-to-Consumer Sequencing NARRATIVE Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of death and the most significant contributor to disability-adjusted life years in the United States. Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the primary mechanism for the development of CVD and ten-year risk estimation is the foundation of current lipid-lowering therapy guidelines. The success of this project will improve the prediction of ASCVD and serve as a model for health information exchange derived risk estimation and population-guided preventative therapy recommendation.",Improving the Accuracy of ASCVD Risk Estimation Using Population-Level EHR and Genetic Data,10068605,F30LM013320,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Pharmacotherapy ', ' Drug Therapy ', ' drug treatment ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Family ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Learning ', ' Linear Models ', ' Lipids ', ' Maps ', ' Medical Records ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Modernization ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Natural Language Processing ', ' natural language understanding ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Physicians ', ' Probability ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Rhode Island ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Woman ', ' Work ', ' Morphologic artifacts ', ' Artifacts ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Logistic Regressions ', ' Randomized Clinical Trials ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Disease Progression ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Smoker ', ' Scientist ', ' System ', ' Equation ', ' cardiovascular disease epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' Performance ', ' success ', ' computer science ', ' cohort ', ' adjudicative process and procedure ', ' adjudication ', ' Single Base Polymorphism ', ' single nucleotide variant ', ' Single Nucleotide Polymorphism ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' portability ', ' Meta-Analysis ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Data ', ' Genetic Risk ', ' Patient outcome ', ' Patient-Centered Outcomes ', ' Patient-Focused Outcomes ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Smoking Status ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' DALY ', ' disability-adjusted life years ', ' biomed informatics ', ' biomedical informatics ', ' markov model ', ' single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping ', ' SNP genotyping ', ' Population ', ' open source ', ' population based ', ' clinical practice ', ' data transfer ', ' data transmission ', ' data exchange ', ' social health determinants ', ' math sciences ', ' mathematic sciences ', ' mathematical sciences ', ' Bayesian adaptive designs ', ' Bayesian adaptive models ', ' Bayesian belief network ', ' Bayesian belief updating model ', ' Bayesian framework ', ' Bayesian hierarchical model ', ' Bayesian network model ', ' Bayesian nonparametric models ', ' Bayesian spatial data model ', ' Bayesian spatial image models ', ' Bayesian spatial models ', ' Bayesian statistical models ', ' Bayesian tracking algorithms ', ' Bayesian Modeling ', ' patient subgroups ', ' patient subpopulations ', ' patient subtypes ', ' patient subsets ', ' Preventative treatment ', ' Preventive treatment ', ' Preventative therapy ', ' Preventive therapy ', ' genomic data-set ', ' genomic dataset ', ' genomic data ', ' recruit ', ' Data Banks ', ' Databanks ', ' data depository ', ' data repository ', ' data warehouse ', ' artificial neural net ', ' computational neural network ', ' synthetic neural network ', ' artificial neural network ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Bayesian Network ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NLM,BROWN UNIVERSITY,F30,2020,50520,0.11135077316849412
"Cardiovascular Disparities among Bereaved Latinos and Non-Latino Whites and Factors that Facilitate Resilience: A Biobehavioral Approach ABSTRACT  The proposed five-year plan for Dr. Luz Garcini's K01 Mentor Career Development Award will help launch her independent research career in biobehavioral health disparities and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. In the proposed project, Dr. Garcini aims at filling a gap in the literature by understanding how bereavement increases CVD risk, including detecting relevant ethnic disparities and identifying protective factors during this difficult life transition. The proposed training and mentoring plan will supplement Dr. Garcini's expertise in health disparities and community-based research with a foundation in CVD and psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) at premiere academic and medical institutions under the mentorship of renowned experts.  The proposed research will use data from a longitudinal study among 96 recently (<2 months) bereaved adults (50% Latino, 50% Non-Latino White) with CVD risk assessments (i.e., glucocorticoid (GC) resistance and inflammation) done at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months post enrollment. Survey measures of relevant mediators and moderators will take place at each time point, with a qualitative interview done after the last visit. The proposed project will draw on Dr. Garcini's expertise, along with a mentoring team at the forefront of biomedical science, to conduct the following aims using an interdisciplinary and culturally sensitive approach. AIM 1. To assess ethnic differences (Latinos, non-Latino Whites) in the association between grief symptoms and CVD risk (GC resistance and inflammation) among bereaved adults cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Hypothesis 1. The strength of the association between grief symptoms and CVD risk will be relatively stronger among Latinos compared to Non-Latino Whites. AIM 2. To identify contextual and cultural factors that facilitate coping with bereavement among Latinos and non-Latino Whites. AIM 3. To supplement Dr. Garcini's expertise in community-based research and health disparities with a foundation in CVD and psychoneuroimmunology (PNI) at premiere institutions and under the mentorship of renowned experts with the goal of increasing faculty diversity in the biomedical sciences. The proposed studies will offer an invaluable context to apply these concepts in a meaningful way—integrating didactics and experience, with the mentorship of an advising team of experts.  The proposed research will provide novel information about mechanisms and predictors that underlie CVD risk in a vulnerable population about which little is known, while also identifying protective factors that foster resilience. The longitudinal design will provide valuable information to identify critical time points for intervention. The interdisciplinary training plan will equip Dr. Garcini with extensive knowledge of CVD and PNI skills to devote her career to the study of biobehavioral health disparities, CVD risk, and social determinants of health, which is needed to inform the development of interventions aimed at reducing disease burden. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is designed to use a biobehavioral approach, a stress-coping model, a culturally sensitive framework, and innovative methods in psychoneuroimmunology to provide novel information about how bereavement increases cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, including detecting relevant ethnic disparities and identifying protective factors that promote resilience during this difficult life transition. Results from this project will provide critical evidence to inform the development of culturally and contextually sensitive interventions aimed at reducing disease burden in a vulnerable population.

"Apolipoprotein-C Proteoforms in Dyslipidemia and Cardiovascular Disease Abstract Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk. Although apoC-III is typically measured as total plasma apoC-III concentration, it is present in blood in several post-translational proteoforms - with the most abundant forms containing zero, one or two sialic acid molecules. However, the relationships between apoC-III proteoforms and patterns of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk are largely unknown. We found that higher relative amounts of apoC-III with two sialic acids (but not 0 or 1) were linked in cross-sectional and prospective studies with lower triglyceride levels, and were associated with reduced risk for CVD events. Our data also indicate ratios of these proteoforms may vary with race and lipid-lowering therapies and that proteoforms of both apoC-I and C-II also demonstrate unique relationships with blood lipid concentrations. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a large community based cohort study of CVD risk factors, subclinical measures of atherosclerosis and determinants of major CVD events. Importantly, the diverse ethnic and racial population within the study will permit a definitive study of these proteoforms and their relationships with lipid abnormalities, atherosclerosis and CVD events while exploring ethnic/racial differences. The present proposal will utilize a novel mass spectrometry immunoassay (MSIA) to investigate the relationships of apoC-III (and secondarily apo-CI and C-II) proteoforms with plasma lipid concentrations, progression of vascular calcification and carotid atherosclerosis, and development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within the MESA cohort. Total plasma apoC-III concentrations and apoC-III relative proteoform amounts will be determined by MSIA in baseline and 10-year follow-up plasma samples. Aim 1 will examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between apoC-III measures and plasma lipids. Aim 2 will determine whether apoC-III measures predict baseline atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis progression evaluated from CT scans of coronary arteries and ultrasonography-derived carotid-intima-media thickness measured during MESA. Aim 3 will determine the relationship between apoC-III measures and incident MACE and total CVD events. This will be the first large study evaluating relationships between apoC proteoforms and CVD risk. As therapies are now being developed to specifically target apoC proteins to reduce triglycerides and CVD risk, a more definitive understanding of the complexity and clinical implications of the apoC family of proteins is needed. As diabetes and lipid-lowering therapies appear to have differential effects on apoC proteoforms, targeting therapy to specific proteoforms and/or subsets of individuals may be beneficial. As we have demonstrated that there are proteoforms of many other plasma proteins, this study may also help highlight the broader value of identifying variations in post-translational protein structure and their functional differences. Narrative The present proposal will utilize a novel mass spectrometry immunoassay to investigate the relationships of apolipoprotein CIII (apoC-III) post-translational variants (proteoforms) with plasma lipid concentrations, progression of vascular calcification and carotid atherosclerosis, and development of major adverse cardiovascular events within the MESA community based cohort. This study will provide a definitive understanding of the complexity and clinical implications of the apoC family of proteins, and may help guide current and future therapies directed towards lowering apoC-III and triglycerides.

Early adult and midlife cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and subclinical disease may be important drivers of cognitive decline in midlife, a period that most likely is critical for influencing later life dementia risk. Yet, few studies have investigated early adulthood CVD risk exposures, including timing of exposure and whether subthreshold levels impact later life cognition. To accomplish these goals, we propose, to add cognitive testing to the Year 35 visit of the ongoing multisite Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study. At baseline, CARDIA enrolled 5,115 black and white participants (mean age 24) who have been carefully followed for 30 years and had cognitive testing at visit years 25 and 30. Cognitive evaluation at Year 35 will allow us to determine 10-year cognitive change (mean age 50 to 60) at a critical time point when cognitive decline starts to diverge and potentially impacts late-life dementia risk. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine, using a life-course approach, the independent associations of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with timing, level (both subthreshold and threshold) and trend in CVD risk factors including body mass index, blood pressure, and fasting glucose, assessed over 35 years from early adult to midlife; 2) To determine the association of 10-year midlife cognitive decline with novel subclinical CVD markers over time including carotid artery intima thickness, coronary artery calcification and cardiac function; 3) To determine whether CVD risk factors and subclinical CVD markers are associated with brain aging indices in midlife, derived by the application of machine-learning neuroimaging pattern analysis to brain MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data obtained on nearly 700 CARDIA participants at midlife; Exploratory) To assess black/white disparities in 10- year cognitive decline and determine the extent to which such disparities are explained by burden of CVD risk. Guided by strong preliminary data, our main hypothesis is that CVD risk factors begin to exert influence as early as the third decade of life and that subthreshold levels (eg systolic blood pressure ≥120 mm) are important drivers for this. In addition, we hypothesize that subclinical CVD measures (especially cardiac function and atherosclerosis) are associated with greater decline in midlife cognition and accelerated brain aging. No other study in the US has such comprehensive data on a wide array of early adult CVD risk factors that may influence cognitive aging. As an experienced multidisciplinary team using innovative statistical methods to analyze essentially unique longitudinal data on early adult and midlife CVD risk factors and subclinical disease, we have the opportunity to investigate the associations of these life-course exposures with cognitive decline and brain health in midlife. Identifying dementia risk factors early in the life-course may lead to interventions to help maintain healthy brain aging and prevent the onset of dementia. PROJECT NARRATIVE We propose to study how cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes and obesity may influence cognitive function changes in midlife. We will apply a life-course approach to this investigation by carefully studying how CVD risk and preclinical markers beginning in early adulthood (20s and 30s) may affect midlife cognitive functioning and brain aging. In this way, the study has great public health value as it will inform ways to possibly prevent Alzheimer disease and vascular changes in the brain.",Lifecourse CVD Risk and Midlife Cognitive

"Role of Skeletal Muscle Health on Poor LIfestyle Related Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary  Population-based studies have traditionally focused on measurement of body fat (i.e. obesity) to assess the contribution of poor lifestyles to insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. While much less recognized is the role of skeletal muscle in these conditions. Built on our proposed biobehavioral model which incorporates multi- dimensional evaluation of skeletal muscle health (i.e. mass, function, strength, and intermuscular fat infiltration) and its molecular transducer (i.e. myokine response to whole body vibration), the fundamental objective of this proposal is to evaluate the systemic contribution of skeletal muscle health in mediating the role of obesogenic lifestyles (i.e. psychosocial stress, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity) on insulin resistance and the development of preclinical markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (i.e. arterial stiffness, carotid intima media thickness and endothelial function). To evaluate the impact of environmental factors on manifestation of biological markers, genetic influences must be controlled. Building on our Georgia CV Twin Study which has evaluated a multi-ethnic twin samples of 532 twin pairs with roughly equal number of African Americans (AA) and European Americans (EA) 4 times over 15 years and has physical activity and psychosocial stress collected during these visits, we will conduct one additional follow-up visit (age range 22-45 yrs) to measure skeletal muscle health, insulin resistance and preclinical markers of CVD. The specific aims are to test the hypotheses that: (1) Obesogenic lifestyle factors (i.e. psychosocial stress, physical inactivity and unhealthy diet) will jointly or distinctively impair skeletal muscle health, and impaired skeletal muscle health will be the pathway through which obesogenic lifestyle factors exert their influence on insulin resistance and preclinical markers of CVD. (2) Myokine response to whole body vibration will be the molecular transducers mediating the effect of skeletal muscle health on insulin resistance and preclinical markers of CVD. (3) Ethnicity and gender may modify the influence of obesogenic lifestyle factors upon aim 1 and 2. The secondary aims are: (1) To examine whether skeletal muscle health can explain the health disparity between AAs and EAs in the risk of type 2 diabetes and CVD. (2) To examine the potential effects of gene-environment interactions on skeletal muscle response to obesogenic lifestyles. This proposal represents a paradigm shift by focusing on impairments in skeletal muscle rather than adiposity as a cause of poor lifestyle induced metabolic and vascular dysfunction. This information can not only guide the effective dissemination of the knowledge and increase the success rate of behavior changes, but also has the potential to generate new treatment strategies targeting the critical illness in which skeletal muscle as a determinant of survival. Furthermore, increased understanding of the mechanisms contributing to health disparities between AAs and EAs will enable the development of ethnicity- specific prevention strategies. Project Narrative  Population-based studies have traditionally focused on the measurement of body fat (i.e. obesity) to assess the contribution of poor lifestyles to insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk. This project aims to find how skeletal muscle health and its molecular transducer play a role in chronic diseases linked with unhealthy lifestyle such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.",Role of Skeletal Muscle Health on Poor LIfestyle Related Type 2 Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease Risk,10007819,R01DK117365,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Animals ', ' Blood Circulation ', ' Bloodstream ', ' Circulation ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Critical Illness ', ' Critically Ill ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Endothelium ', ' Vascular Endothelium ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Fatty acid glycerol esters ', ' Fats ', ' Fibrinogen ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor I ', ' Blood Coagulation Factor One ', ' Blood Factor One ', ' Coagulation Factor I ', ' Coagulation Factor One ', ' Factor I ', ' Factor One ', ' Habits ', ' Half-Life ', ' Health ', ' Homeostasis ', ' Autoregulation ', ' Physiological Homeostasis ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mitochondria ', ' mitochondrial ', ' Muscle ', ' Muscle Tissue ', ' muscular ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Peptides ', ' Play ', ' Risk ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Transducers ', ' Twin Multiple Birth ', ' Twins ', ' Vascular Diseases ', ' Vascular Disorder ', ' blood vessel disorder ', ' vascular dysfunction ', ' vasculopathy ', ' cytokine ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Organ ', ' improved ', ' Adipose Cell ', ' Fat Cells ', ' Lipocytes ', ' Mature Lipocyte ', ' Mature fat cell ', ' Adipocytes ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Physical activity ', ' Failure ', ' Individual ', ' European ', ' muscle bulk ', ' muscle mass ', ' muscle form ', ' Measurement ', ' Voluntary Muscle ', ' Skeletal Muscle ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Ecological impact ', ' Environmental Impact ', ' Twin Studies ', ' Metabolic ', ' Genetic ', ' Exposure to ', ' Infiltration ', ' Shapes ', ' Body fat ', ' Knowledge ', ' Pattern ', ' vibration ', ' muscle strength ', ' behavior change ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' Gene x Environment Interaction ', ' GxE interaction ', ' environment effect on gene ', ' gene environment interaction ', ' success ', ' energy balance ', ' arterial stiffening ', ' artery stiffening ', ' artery stiffness ', ' arterial stiffness ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' population-based study ', ' population-level study ', ' studies of populations ', ' study of the population ', ' Population Study ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' insulin sensitivity ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' High Prevalence ', ' life-style factor ', ' lifestyle factors ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' Impairment ', ' treatment strategy ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' obesigenic ', ' obesogenic ', ' unhealthy lifestyle ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' pre-clinical development ', ' preclinical development ', ' preservation ', ' weight loss programming ', ' weight loss program ', ' Metabolic dysfunction ', ' carotid intima-media thickness ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' ']",NIDDK,AUGUSTA UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,660883,0.0525589457624919
"An Electronic Health Record based Dashboard-driven Intervention to Improve Identification and Management of Preventive Care for Cardiovascular Disease Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality both in the United States and in the world, and is one of the most costly chronic conditions. The incidence of CVD triples at age 40-50 compared to younger age, and increases 50% or more at each decade of age after that, is also strongly associated to race and ethnicity. Though CVD related preventive cares have been recommended by USPSTF guideline, only less than 40% at risk patients complete one of those preventive cares timely. The objective of the project is to develop, implement, and evaluate an electronic health record (EHR)-based preventive care dashboard management tool and team-based intervention to improve compliance of CVD related preventive care for primary care patients 50 years and older. The proposed dashboard is seamlessly integrated within the electronic health record (EHR) to: (a) identify adults with CVD risk; (b) suggest personalized CVD related preventive components and associated recommendations of action (e.g. screening test order, medication order, etc.) at point-of-care visit with primary care providers; and (c) engage population health management teams between visits. The development and pilot test will take place during R61 phase. In the R33 phase, we rigorously test the impact of the tool using a cluster randomized controlled trial with ~200 primary care physicians and assess intervention impact on completion of 4 key preventive care elements for patients at risk for CVD: (1) diabetes screening, (2) blood pressure monitoring; (3) lifestyle (smoking cessation, diet and physical activities); (4) appropriate aspirin and statin use. The intervention, referred to as CVD Preventive Care Dashboard Management (CVD-PCDM) tool, provides patient-specific and clinician-specific CVD preventive care recommendations and risk estimate in low-literacy format to the primary care provider (PCP) and patients at each primary care encounter to facilitate shared decision making and patient education. This CVD-PCDM will be co-designed with clinicians using a successful digital solution development and test cycle which has been tested in other similar dashboard systems current running at Sutter, and implemented in primary care clinics. Scalability of the CVD-PCDM will be first tested within Sutter in two geographically and racially distinct operation units. Meanwhile, we will also identify one health care system from Health Care System Research Network (HCSRN) to duplicate the intervention and assess the effect. HCSRN consists of large health care systems in the US, and has actively promoted collaborative research. If the CVD-PCDM is effective at Sutter, the codes and development package will be shared with the second site. We will design a digital solution scalable pipeline that can be rapidly and consistently translates this guideline-based preventive care into delivery of personalized and coordinated CVD care within primary care settings. Preventing and managing the key Cardiovascular (CVD) risk factors including unhealthy lifestyle, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smoking is one of the most effective ways to diminish the burden of CVD. This project focuses on development an Electronic Health Record-based CVD preventive dashboard management tool (R61 phase) to improve compliance with USPSTF guideline-based preventive care for CVD, and rigorously assess the impact of tool in a cluster randomized trial for people at elevated risk, including older age groups (≥50 years) and people from racial and ethnic minorities (R33 phase). This low-cost and highly scalable tool has high potential to improve CVD preventive care and translates personalized preventive care through re-engineering EHR into tangible health benefits for large numbers of patients with CVD risk.",An Electronic Health Record based Dashboard-driven Intervention to Improve Identification and Management of Preventive Care for Cardiovascular Disease,10049974,R61AG068927,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Blood Pressure Monitors ', ' Continuous Sphygmomanometers ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Communication ', ' Counseling ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Pharmaceutical Preparations ', ' Drugs ', ' Medication ', ' Pharmaceutic Preparations ', ' drug/agent ', ' Elements ', ' Engineering ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health education ', ' Health Instruction ', ' Health Tutoring ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Hyperlipidemia ', ' Hyperlipemia ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Learning ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' literacy ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Names ', ' Patient Education ', ' Patient Instruction ', ' Patient Training ', ' Patients ', ' Physicians ', ' Primary Care Physician ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Running ', ' Smoking ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' United States ', ' Work ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Health Benefit ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Physical activity ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' tool ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' non-compliant ', ' noncompliance ', ' noncompliant ', ' non-compliance ', ' burn-out ', ' burnout ', ' Visit ', ' age group ', ' member ', ' Prevention ', ' Coding System ', ' Code ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preventive ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Risk Estimate ', ' Process ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' health literacy ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' systems research ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' intervention efficacy ', ' therapeutic efficacy ', ' therapeutically effective ', ' therapy efficacy ', ' Treatment Efficacy ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' group intervention ', ' primary care setting ', ' population health ', ' shared decision making ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' operation ', ' screening ', ' unhealthy lifestyle ', ' Cluster randomization trial ', ' Cluster randomized trial ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' racial minority ', ' health seeking behavior ', ' dashboard ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' patient engagement ', ' ']",NIA,CALIFORNIA PACIFIC MED CTR RES INSTITUTE,R61,2020,264368,0.19755224197966675
"Cardiovascular and Cerebrovascular Risk Factors for Mobility Limitation in the Jackson Heart Study ABSTRACT Walking is a core activity of human life. Mobility limitation, or difficulty or inability to walk, can limit a person's ability to work, live independently, and participate in the community. Heart and brain health are two of the strongest modifiable pathways to mobility limitation. African Americans have a disproportionate burden of cardiovascular disease (CVD), cerebrovascular disease (CBVD), cognitive impairment, and mobility limitation, but the majority of research on the relationship between these conditions has been conducted in predominantly white populations. The biology and optimal prevention strategies for mobility limitation may differ by race/ethnicity, highlighting a critical need for research in underrepresented populations. The proposed research will add validated measures of mobility, disability, and physical performance to the Jackson Heart Study (JHS), a cohort study of African Americans, designed to investigate causes of CVD in a high-risk population. JHS participants have undergone three exams (Exam 1, 2000-2004, Exam 2, 2005-2008, Exam 3, 2009-2013); Exam 4 is scheduled on the 3,500 remaining participants (mean age = 65 years) beginning in 2020. The exam will include extensive CVD measures, socioeconomic status, psychosocial health, cognitive testing, and brain MRI. We propose an ancillary study to add established measures of mobility limitation: gait speed <0.6 m/s, and self-reported difficulty/inability to walk a quarter of a mile or climb 10 stairs. We will leverage the nearly 20 years of data on CVD/CBVD risk factors and newly collected data on subclinical vascular disease and brain health to better understand the timing of exposure to risk factors and mediating pathways to mobility limitation in African Americans. We hypothesize that exposure to high blood pressure, high fasting glucose, and adiposity in midlife will have stronger associations with mobility limitation in older adults than exposure to these risk factors in late life. We will use novel statistical mediation methods to quantify the extent to which potential mediators explain the relationship between CVD/CBVD risk factors and mobility limitation, while allowing us to test for potential interactions by these mediators. This research will support our long-term goal to enhance functional health among African Americans, in order to preserve independence and participation in the community. Understanding the link between heart and brain health and mobility limitation is critical to reduce racial disparities in health. Moreover, the addition of the functional measures will help expand JHS into a contemporary study cardiovascular health and aging in African Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE Difficulty or inability to walk, can limit a person's ability to work, live independently, and participate in the community.

"Rural Intervention for Caregivers' Heart Health (RICHH) ABSTRACT  In the patient-family caregiver dyad, emphasis traditionally has been on the patient or on helping the caregiver take care of the patient. This approach ignores the health of the caregiver. Family caregivers of patients with chronic disease are at uniquely high risk for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Because of the environment they share with the patient, lack of time for personal care due to caregiving demands, and persistent psychological distress, caregivers of patients with chronic illness have substantially higher risk for CVD than non-caregivers. To reduce this risk, cardiovascular health interventions aimed at (1) CVD risk reduction (2) improving adherence to self-management of CVD risk reducing behaviors, and (3) preventing and managing depressive symptoms are required. Rural caregivers are particularly at risk for poor health. Most rural areas are characterized by marked health disparities, including elevated CVD risk, persistent poverty, and lack of social and healthcare resources. As such, innovative intervention programs are needed to improve cardiovascular health among rural caregivers while overcoming personal and environmental barriers to achieving this goal.  The Rural Intervention for Caregivers’ Heart Health (RICHH) program proposed in this study will address the important components of CVD risk reduction for rural caregivers of patients with chronic illness – most notably improved self-management of CVD risk reduction efforts, including prevention and management of depressive symptoms. We propose an innovative delivery modality designed to overcome environmental barriers in socioeconomically austere rural areas. The purpose of the proposed 2-group (RICHH vs control) randomized clinical trial is to examine short- and long-term effects of the RICHH intervention on CVD risk (i.e., lipid profile, body mass index, and blood pressure), self-care behaviors (i.e., diet quality, physical activity level, self-reported adherence to health behaviors), and depressive symptoms, compared to usual care control in rural caregivers of persons with chronic disease. A total of 280 caregivers of patients with chronic illness will be enrolled. Rural caregivers will be randomly assigned to either the RICHH intervention group or a usual care control group. We will stratify caregivers by gender in order to examine the moderating effect of gender on intervention outcomes, given the many differences between male and female caregivers. The RICHH intervention (6 interactive modules) will be delivered for 12 weekly sessions (30- to 45 minutes per session). In order to enhance maintenance of behaviors, we will also deliver 8 biweekly (every other week) booster sessions (20-30 minutes per sessions) for 2 months and then 6 monthly sessions. All sessions are delivered individually using a video-conferencing program on a multimedia digital device (i.e., mini iPad). Data on outcomes will be collected at baseline, 4 months and 12 months. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Rural caregivers of individuals with chronic illness are at uniquely high risk for development of heart disease. We propose to test the Rural Intervention for Caregivers’ Heart Health program, an innovative self- management program designed to lower heart disease and depression risk, and overcome environmental and personal barriers to self-management.

"Implementation of EMR-Integrated Referrals to Link Clinical and Community Services to Reduce Health Inequity ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) exerts a disproportionate burden of morbidity and mortality on African Americans in the rural southeast. Much of this excess has been attributed, directly and indirectly, to social determinants of health and resulting health-related social needs. While CVD prevention interventions have reduced overall disease burden, they have failed to eliminate racial and geographic disparities in CVD. New models of care, such as Accountable Health Communities, address health-related social needs through screening, referral, and community navigation services and have begun to demonstrate improvement in health care cost, use, and CVD risk factors. Rural minority communities, where the burden of CVD risk factors and social needs are high, healthcare facilities may be more fragile and density of resources may be lower, have even greater need for effective and scalable solutions to addressing health and social needs. Our proposal is anchored by Bandura's Self-Efficacy theory, Grey's Self and Family Management Framework, and Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Services Use. We will use the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to study implementation and effectiveness of integrating health-promoting community resource data into the EMR via CommunityRx (CRx). The CRx-CVD intervention is a digital solution that links patients with community-based resources to address health-related social needs and cardiometabolic health in rural AA patients. Our overall objective is to identify factors that influence implementation and assess the health impact of a closed-loop referral system to community health-promoting resources in a rural setting. We use a hybrid II implementation effectiveness design to conduct a controlled pragmatic trial of patients (adults 18 years and over, children 2-17 years; N=750) in a system of federally qualified health centers in rural North Carolina. We hypothesize that integration of closed-loop referrals will increase patient knowledge of community resources, enhance self-efficacy to manage CVD risk factors, increase utilization of community resources and improve markers of cardiometabolic conditions. To our knowledge, this trial will be the first to evaluate the implementation and health impact of a low intensity, scalable, clinic-initiated intervention targeting AA adults and children at risk of CVD. Furthermore, we will conduct cost-effectiveness analysis related to implementation of CRx-CVD to inform scaling the intervention. The long-term goal is to identify scalable interventions to reduce CVD risk and health-related social needs of African Americans using a “whole person” approach to health. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE Heart disease prematurely ends African American lives in the rural southeast. New ways to prevent heart disease are needed that help people access resources to live a healthy life using a “whole person” approach to CVD and social needs, especially in high-need communities.",Implementation of EMR-Integrated Referrals to Link Clinical and Community Services to Reduce Health Inequity,9886378,R01HL150909,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Communities ', ' Community Services ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health care facility ', ' Health Facilities ', ' Healthcare Facility ', ' care facilities ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Hybrids ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Lipids ', ' Literature ', ' Maps ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' North Carolina ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Patients ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Stress ', ' Translations ', ' United States ', ' Weight ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' County ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Rural Community ', ' Self Management ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' density ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Application Context ', ' contextual factors ', ' Services ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' Self Efficacy ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Effectiveness ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' cost efficient analysis ', ' cost-effective analysis ', ' Cost Effectiveness Analysis ', ' Data ', ' Preventative intervention ', ' Prevention intervention ', ' preventional intervention strategy ', ' Preventive Intervention ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' Federally Qualified Health Center ', ' Clinical Services ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' burden to community ', ' community burden ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Behavioral Model ', ' family management ', ' implementation research ', ' digital ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' rural health network ', ' implementation science ', ' high risk ', ' public health relevance ', ' standard of care ', ' pragmatic effectiveness trial ', ' pragmatic trial ', ' social health determinants ', ' screening ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' health service utilization ', ' health service use ', ' data resource ', ' minority communities ', ' rural health care ', ' rural healthcare ', ' rural African American ', ' rural locality ', ' rural place ', ' rural setting ', ' care costs ', ' Cost efficiency ', ' service providers ', ' health care management ', ' healthcare management ', ' health management ', ' implementation strategy ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' community clinic ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' clinical encounter ', ' cost estimation ', ' cost estimate ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' Rural Minority ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,793622,0.20807520592574288
"Pathways to cardiovascular disease prevention and impact of specialty referral in under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV There is an urgent need to determine pathways to cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention for under- represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV and elevated cardiovascular risk. Such evidence will ultimately inform clinical care guidelines and health system interventions to improve health for health disparity populations with HIV. Thus, the long-term goal of this proposal is to generate evidence-based recommendations for the management of CVD risk in PLWH. The overall objectives of this application are to demonstrate the effect of cardiology referral on CVD health outcomes in a large racially/ethnically diverse cohort of people living with HIV (PLWH), and to generate qualitative and quantitative evidence to guide development of a future intervention. Our central hypothesis is that cardiology referral reduces incident CVD events in Blacks/African-Americans and other racial/ethnic minorities with HIV compared to non-referral. The rationale for our research is that, once it is known how these health disparity populations with HIV access cardiology referrals and the subsequent impact on CVD outcomes, an interventional can be appropriately designed to test new and innovative approaches to the management of co-morbidities for PLWH at elevated CVD risk. We plan to test our central hypothesis and thereby accomplish our overall objectives by pursuing the following three specific aims: (Aim 1) To measure the association between cardiology referral and CVD outcomes in under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV, (Aim 2) To identify the individual- and health system-level factors that impact CVD outcomes for under-represented racial/ethnic minorities, and (Aim 3) To develop a qualitative framework for an intervention to improve CVD outcomes in PLWH. We will retrospectively analyze patient-level data from electronic health records from institutions in the U.S. Southeast “HIV-belt” and “Heart Attack belt”, using PCORnet’s Common Data Model. We will retrospectively identify cohorts of African- American and other under-represented racial/ethnic minorities and non-Hispanic white patients with HIV. Start date will be first clinical contact after January 1, 2010 to create a contemporary cohort with at least 5 years of longitudinal follow-up. The main independent variable is a clinic visit with a cardiologist, compared to not having such a visit, prior to first CVD event. Our primary outcome is myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke, coronary heart disease, death or cardiovascular death after 5 years. Our scientific contribution is expected to be significant because we are addressing a dire health comorbidity for PLWH. Our group’s efforts are likely to contribute to greater understanding of how HIV-related CVD effects treatment outcomes among under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV. As a consequence of the work proposed, we expect to identify the underlying pathways to ideal CVD care for under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV. We anticipate results that lead to better integration and coordination of care and ultimately improve CVD health outcomes for health disparity populations with HIV. The proposed research is relevant to public health because cardiovascular disease comorbidity is a dire health concern for under-represented racial/ethnic minorities living with HIV. As a consequence of the work proposed, we expect to identify the underlying pathways leading to better cardiac health outcomes for under-represented racial/ethnic minorities with HIV.

"Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study Project Summary In the U.S., approximately 840,000 Americans die from cardiovascular disease (CVD) each year. The prevalence of CVD is on the rise and widespread disparities in CVD exist across economic, racial, and ethnic groups. In order to address the rising prevalence of CVD and persistent disparities, there has been a shift in focus to public health strategies addressing cardiovascular health (CVH). CVH is a broader and more positive construct beyond the absence of CVD. Despite this recent focus on improving CVH, widespread disparities still exist. Social determinants of health (SDOH) may be important contributors to these continued disparities. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines SDOH as the “structural determinants and conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, and age.” There has been limited work in studying how a diverse set of SDOH change over time and perform in the prediction of CVH. To address this need, we will identify patterns of SDOH exposure over time and determine if the addition of SDOH variables allows for better prediction of an individual's CVH status. The primary hypothesis is that a diverse set of SDOH will be associated with and improve the prediction of CVH, independent of baseline CVH and other covariates. To examine this hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: 1) identify patterns of SDOH exposure up to age 50 and define exposure subgroups and 2) determine whether overall and domain-specific patterns of SDOH exposures from young adulthood to middle age, identified in Aim 1, are associated with and improve the prediction of CVH and its component metrics. We will utilize the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, a prospective cohort study with detailed information on cardiovascular risk factors and disease in a geographically and racially diverse sample of young adults. In Aim 1, we will use a novel sequential pattern mining method to identify the associations among SDOH and determine the SDOH exposure patterns from baseline to age 50. The Aim 1 SDOH exposure definitions will be included as predictors of CVH at age 50 and beyond using supervised machine learning techniques. By including SDOH in predictive models, health services professionals and clinicians may have an improved understanding of patients at high-risk for low CVH and may better tailor social and clinical interventions to each patient's needs. If awarded, this fellowship will allow me to contribute novel research to the SDOH and cardiovascular health fields, gain competency in new research skills, and improve my writing and presentation skills. The completion of this project and training will prepare me for my long-term career goal of becoming an independent research scientist in an academic setting, studying SDOH and using data science and informatics tools to improve public health. Project Narrative The incorporation of social determinants of health (SDOH) in predictive models for cardiovascular health (CVH) may help health services professionals and clinicians in identifying patients at high-risk for low CVH. This has important public health implications because social and clinical interventions may be tailored to each patient's needs. This research may also help to identify which SDOH are predictive of CVH from young adulthood to middle age, allowing public health professionals to target specific SDOH through directed social, behavioral, and policy-related interventions.",Social Determinants of Health and Novel Prediction of Cardiovascular Health from Young Adulthood to Middle Age in the CARDIA Study,9911103,F31HL151178,"['Accounting ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' American Heart Association ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Fellowship ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Health Services ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Maintenance ', ' Methods ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Mining ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Time ', ' Work ', ' World Health Organization ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' Competence ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Mediating ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Policies ', ' machine learned ', ' Machine Learning ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' Techniques ', ' Healthy diet ', ' balanced diet ', ' good diet ', ' age group ', ' American ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' race differences ', ' racial difference ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Research Training ', ' Subgroup ', ' Smoking Status ', ' sex ', ' Behavioral ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' fasting plasma glucose ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' health economics ', ' computer based prediction ', ' prediction model ', ' prognostic model ', ' predictive modeling ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' high risk ', ' patient population ', ' social health determinants ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults ', ' Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' built environment ', ' training opportunity ', ' Predictive Analytics ', ' Data Science ', ' biracial ', ' racially diverse ', ' racial diversity ', ' Prospective cohort study ', ' secondary analysis ', ' machine learned algorithm ', ' machine learning algorithm ', ' supervised machine learning ', ' supervised learning ', ' informatics tool ', ' social factors ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,F31,2020,40733,0.12371689259712308
"Informing Cardiovascular Disease Prevention among Rural Appalachian Women: A Community-Engaged Mixed Method Study PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT In Appalachia, a largely rural and low socioeconomic status region, premature mortality rates are 25 percent higher than all US counties.1,2 Appalachian populations have significantly higher rates of heart disease mortality compared to national averages,3 including high rates for women.4,5 With high proportions of uncontrolled risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD),6-8 the need for strategies to increase CVD screening rates among rural Appalachian women is a public health priority.9 A comprehensive exploration of the complex and interconnected barriers and facilitators for CVD preventative screenings is required to better understand decision-making.10,11 Recommended screening for CVD covers physiologic tests (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure) and self-reported behaviors (e.g., smoking, physical activity).12,13 However, the completion and follow-up from screenings by rural Appalachian women remains low.11 This research builds upon available Appalachian disparity research, which suggests a range of interconnected factors combine to affect screening decision-making by rural Appalachian women.14-27 As a gap exists between knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs and screening behavior,17,20,26 this mixed method study consists of context-specific strategies to uncover interconnections between individual, social, and environmental levels and to inform interventions to increase CVD preventative screenings by rural Appalachian women.17,18 Through a novel community-engaged mixed method approach of combining spatial analysis and concept mapping, this research aims to: 1) Assess the association of county-level resource distribution and cardiovascular health outcomes for women to identify varying patterns among the rural Appalachian counties of PA and 2) Identify community perceptions of the range of barriers and facilitators to the receipt of preventive CVD screenings by rural Appalachian women. The proposed study will inform the Healthy People 2020 goal to assess health disparities in relation to demographic factors such as gender, SES, and geographic location28 and will address NHLBI’s critical challenges to further explore sex/gender-specificity in research and to advance methods for characterizing exposures to understand differences in health among populations.29 To facilitate this research, I will undertake educational and training opportunities to develop skills and knowledge in: 1) CVD prevention among women, 2) spatial analysis, 3) concept mapping methodology, 4) the role of environmental and community-level factors that affect rural women’s health in the Appalachian region, and 5) expand skills in action-oriented research with community partners. I will conduct the proposed research with support from a dedicated and multi-disciplinary mentorship team in a resource-rich environment at the University of Pittsburgh. Upon successful completion of this fellowship, I will be well-poised to meet my long-term goals of attaining a faculty position and having an independent scientific research career in chronic disease prevention, health disparities, and community-based research with specialties in rural and female Appalachian populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE This project will enhance the understanding of the complex and interconnected factors affecting the receipt of cardiovascular disease preventative screenings by women in the Appalachian region. Through a novel community-engaged mixed method approach combining spatial analysis and concept mapping, this study will identify individual, social, and environmental factors to address in future population-based interventions to contribute to increased health equity for rural Appalachian women in cardiovascular disease outcomes.",Informing Cardiovascular Disease Prevention among Rural Appalachian Women: A Community-Engaged Mixed Method Study,9981495,F31HL143871,"['Affect ', ' Appalachian Region ', ' Appalachia ', ' Appalachian ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Concept Formation ', ' conceptual processes ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Decision Making ', ' Demographic Factors ', ' Economics ', ' Environment ', ' Exercise ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Fellowship ', ' Female ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Geographic Locations ', ' Geographic Area ', ' Geographic Region ', ' Geographical Location ', ' geographic site ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Priorities ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Maps ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Motivation ', ' Pennsylvania ', ' Perception ', ' Physicians ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Smoking ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Specificity ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Universities ', ' Woman ', ' Wood material ', ' Wood ', ' County ', ' Gender ', "" Women's Health "", ' Female Health ', ' Health Care Costs ', ' Health Costs ', ' Healthcare Costs ', ' base ', ' career ', ' density ', ' rural region ', ' rural area ', ' improved ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Medical ', ' Physical activity ', ' Individual ', ' Rural ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Policies ', ' Measurement ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Event ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' Location ', ' Clinics or Hospitals ', ' Clinics and Hospitals ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' Structure ', ' skills ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' disease prevention ', ' disorder prevention ', ' Environmental Factor ', ' environmental risk ', ' Environmental Risk Factor ', ' social ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' qualitative reasoning ', ' Qualitative Methods ', ' Data ', ' sex ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' health literacy ', ' Preventative screening ', ' Preventive screening ', ' self reported behavior ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' community based design ', ' community based research ', ' participatory action research ', ' community based participatory research ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' public health priorities ', ' Healthy People 2020 ', ' screening ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' concept maps ', ' concept mapping ', ' training opportunity ', ' Preventative care ', ' Preventive care ', ' differences in health ', ' health difference ', ' rural resident ', ' rural dwellers ', ' screening participation ', ' recommended screening ', ' screening recommendations ', ' screening guidelines ', ' Rural Appalachian ', ' Rural Appalachia ', ' social factors ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,F31,2020,22362,0.14083516399944027
"Apolipoprotein-C Proteoforms in Dyslipidemia and Cardiovascular Disease Abstract Apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) is increasingly recognized as an important determinant of dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk. Although apoC-III is typically measured as total plasma apoC-III concentration, it is present in blood in several post-translational proteoforms - with the most abundant forms containing zero, one or two sialic acid molecules. However, the relationships between apoC-III proteoforms and patterns of dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk are largely unknown. We found that higher relative amounts of apoC-III with two sialic acids (but not 0 or 1) were linked in cross-sectional and prospective studies with lower triglyceride levels, and were associated with reduced risk for CVD events. Our data also indicate ratios of these proteoforms may vary with race and lipid-lowering therapies and that proteoforms of both apoC-I and C-II also demonstrate unique relationships with blood lipid concentrations. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is a large community based cohort study of CVD risk factors, subclinical measures of atherosclerosis and determinants of major CVD events. Importantly, the diverse ethnic and racial population within the study will permit a definitive study of these proteoforms and their relationships with lipid abnormalities, atherosclerosis and CVD events while exploring ethnic/racial differences. The present proposal will utilize a novel mass spectrometry immunoassay (MSIA) to investigate the relationships of apoC-III (and secondarily apo-CI and C-II) proteoforms with plasma lipid concentrations, progression of vascular calcification and carotid atherosclerosis, and development of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within the MESA cohort. Total plasma apoC-III concentrations and apoC-III relative proteoform amounts will be determined by MSIA in baseline and 10-year follow-up plasma samples. Aim 1 will examine the cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between apoC-III measures and plasma lipids. Aim 2 will determine whether apoC-III measures predict baseline atherosclerosis and atherosclerosis progression evaluated from CT scans of coronary arteries and ultrasonography-derived carotid-intima-media thickness measured during MESA. Aim 3 will determine the relationship between apoC-III measures and incident MACE and total CVD events. This will be the first large study evaluating relationships between apoC proteoforms and CVD risk. As therapies are now being developed to specifically target apoC proteins to reduce triglycerides and CVD risk, a more definitive understanding of the complexity and clinical implications of the apoC family of proteins is needed. As diabetes and lipid-lowering therapies appear to have differential effects on apoC proteoforms, targeting therapy to specific proteoforms and/or subsets of individuals may be beneficial. As we have demonstrated that there are proteoforms of many other plasma proteins, this study may also help highlight the broader value of identifying variations in post-translational protein structure and their functional differences. Narrative The present proposal will utilize a novel mass spectrometry immunoassay to investigate the relationships of apolipoprotein CIII (apoC-III) post-translational variants (proteoforms) with plasma lipid concentrations, progression of vascular calcification and carotid atherosclerosis, and development of major adverse cardiovascular events within the MESA community based cohort.

"Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults ABSTRACT  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors disproportionately affect black adults, and these disparities are evident early in the life course. Genetic factors do not appear to explain this difference, and studies have increasingly implicated socioeconomic risk factors. Among the most prominent risk factors for racial disparities in CVD is educational attainment, which is strongly correlated with smoking, hypertension, and CVD over the life course. Yet it is unclear which aspects of schooling are most salient. One possible explanation for racial disparities in CVD is that black youth often attend highly racially segregated schools. Segregation is thought to be linked with CVD due to increased stress and discrimination; social norms and peer influence; and the constraining of socioeconomic opportunities that reduces income and healthcare access later in life. Yet despite the fact that school segregation has increased in recent years, there are no studies examining the effects of recent school segregation trends on CVD risk factors. The goal of this study is to provide this urgently needed evidence. In particular, we take advantage of a unique natural experiment, overcoming methodological challenges in the previous literature on the effects of education on CVD. Since 1990, numerous local court decisions have resulted in “resegregation” in school districts across the country. We link nationwide data on these court decisions and school district-level measures of school segregation with CVD outcome data from two large nationally representative U.S. cohort studies of affected youth: the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health, N≈90,000) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (N≈8,000). We employ the quasi-experimental technique of instrumental variables analysis, which reduces typical confounding by factors such as unobserved individual and family characteristics. In Aim 1, our goal is to estimate the short- term effects of school segregation on CVD risk factors—including smoking, physical activity, obesity, and mental health—among youth while they are still in school. In Aim 2, we will examine the long-term effects of school segregation in the decades that follow, with outcomes including those in Aim 1 in addition to objectively measured CVD biomarkers, diabetes, and hypertension. We will also undertake exploratory analyses to determine possible mediating pathways. In Aim 3, we will identify vulnerable subgroups whose development of CVD risk factors differs in response to school racial segregation. This will enable future interventions to be tailored to the most vulnerable individuals. We will employ both hypothesis-driven and hypothesis-generating statistical techniques, including innovative machine learning methods that allow for more complex and robust subgroup identification. Overall, the expected outcome of this research is to produce rigorous evidence on the effects of school racial segregation on CVD risk factors, helping to inform school-based, clinical, and community interventions to reduce persistent and inequitable racial disparities in CVD. PROJECT NARRATIVE  The goal of this research is to examine the short-term and long-term effects of school racial segregation on risk factors for heart disease. We will also assess whether specific subgroups may be more vulnerable to school segregation. This will inform the development of public health programs and school-based interventions to address black-white disparities in heart disease.",Leveraging a Natural Experiment to Estimate the Effects of School Racial Segregation on Cardiovascular Risk Factors among Youth and Young Adults,9943540,R01HL151638,"['Adolescence ', ' 12-20 years old ', ' adolescence (12-20) ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Behavior ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Cognition ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Counseling ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Family Characteristics ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Literature ', ' Longitudinal Studies ', ' long-term study ', ' longitudinal outcome studies ', ' longterm study ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' middle age ', ' mid life ', ' mid-life ', ' middle aged ', ' midlife ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Public Health ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Schools ', ' Smoking ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Work ', ' Gender ', ' Measures ', ' segregation ', ' Racial Segregation ', ' forest ', ' Mediating ', ' Outcomes Research ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Specified ', ' Specific qualifier value ', ' psychological ', ' psychologic ', ' Adolescent Youth ', ' juvenile ', ' juvenile human ', ' Adolescent ', ' Link ', ' Physical activity ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' social norm ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Court Decisions ', ' Logistics ', ' Desegregation ', ' Genetic ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Hour ', ' Complex ', ' Techniques ', ' Country ', ' Occupational ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Reporting ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' response ', ' theories ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Address ', ' Preventive ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' trend ', ' Characteristics ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' community intervention ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' resilience ', ' adolescent fertility ', ' teen fertility ', ' teenage fertility ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Life Stress ', ' Natural experiment ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' peer influence ', ' treatment effect ', ' high risk ', ' new marker ', ' novel biomarker ', ' novel marker ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' peer networks ', ' disparities in race ', ' race disparity ', ' racial disparity ', ' school district ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' black/white disparity ', ' panel study of income dynamics ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' data library ', ' data archive ', ' access to health care ', ' access to healthcare ', ' accessibility of health care ', ' accessibility to health care ', ' accessibility to healthcare ', ' health care access ', ' health care service access ', ' health care service availability ', ' healthcare access ', ' healthcare accessibility ', ' healthcare availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' health care availability ', ' Add Health ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' machine learning method ', ' ']",NHLBI,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO",R01,2020,808862,0.24303802380318457

"Using agent-based modeling to compare strategies that can reduce rural-urban disparities in cardiovascular disease Project Summary Rural-urban disparities in mortality attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) have widened in the United States during the past several decades. The complex interplay of preventive health care delivery and community-level behavioral and contextual factors contribute to the differences in cardiovascular health between rural and urban residents. Recently, systems science and simulation modeling have played an important role in the evaluation, selection, and implementation of evidence-based interventions. However, existing models do not account for either the specific characteristics of populations living in rural communities, or the health care services and other contextual factors of these communities. We propose to use agent-based modeling -- a systems science approach that incorporates data from various sources and simulates real-world clinical or community settings -- to help disentangle these complexities, elucidate causal pathways, and identify potentially effective interventions in rural communities. Our long-term goal is to find effective clinical and public health solutions to reduce rural-urban disparities in cardiovascular health among rural communities in Georgia and New York. Taking an integrated preventive health care and community perspective, we will accomplish our specific aims using an agent-based model of community-based CVD prevention and test the effectiveness of the following interventions at the rural county level. First, we will estimate the health impact of improving health care delivery and access using home-based telemonitoring programs and expanding insurance coverage, focusing on three major CVD risk factors: hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol (Aim 1). Second, we will estimate the health impact of public health interventions, including improving the food environment, community-based health promotion, and increasing tobacco taxes for reducing four important lifestyle factors related with CVD: obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, and smoking (Aim 2). In Aim 3, we will use the CVD Policy Model, a well- validated US population-based CVD epidemiology simulation model and translate projected beneficial effects on the seven risk factors and lifestyles tested in Aim 1 and 2 into downstream impact on CVD events. This will allow us to assess the potential of these individual or combined interventions on rural-urban disparities in the incidence and mortality of CVD and direct medical costs at the state level. The proposed research is innovative because we develop a policy simulation model to inform decision-making for health care and public health management of CVD in rural counties, integrating clinical with community systems to find the most effective evidence-based intervention. Project Narrative As the consequence of rural-urban health disparities in cardiovascular disease risk factors, the US rural population suffers a disproportionately higher prevalence, mortality and economic burden of cardiovascular disease than the urban population. This simulation analysis study will test and compare evidence-based clinical or public health interventions and identify those interventions that promise to narrow the gaps in cardiovascular health

"Effect of GLP-1 on microvascular insulin responses in type 1 diabetes Project Summary/Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is significantly increased in type 1 diabetes (T1DM) compared with the general population. The CVD risk in T1DM is particularly exaggerated in women. Although thought of as an insulin deficient state, T1DM also exhibits insulin resistance (IR), which may relate to supraphysiologic insulin concentrations, hyperglycemia, endothelial dysfunction, and inflammation. In healthy humans, insulin causes vasodilation at the microvascular level in skeletal and cardiac muscles to increase endothelial surface area available for the delivery of nutrients, oxygen, and hormones such as insulin to these tissues. Using contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEU) and insulin clamp, we have confirmed the presence of vascular and metabolic IR in T1DM subjects. Women with T1DM may have greater IR compared with men with T1DM although this has not previously been studied at the vascular level. IR independently predicts both microvascular complications and macrovascular ones like CVD in T1DM. Thus far, there are no Federal Drug Administration approved medications which target IR or vascular complications in T1DM. In large, randomized controlled clinical trials, Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists reduce major adverse cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes. We have previously shown that GLP-1 infusion increases skeletal and cardiac microvascular perfusion in healthy humans and restores insulin-mediated increase in skeletal and cardiac microvascular perfusion in IR rodents. The impact of GLP-1 in T1DM vascular and systemic IR remains unknown. The herein proposed research addresses the hypotheses that, in humans with T1DM, GLP-1 (a) increases microvascular perfusion and improves insulin's microvascular response in skeletal muscle thereby enhancing insulin- mediated glucose disposal and muscle oxygenation and (b) increases cardiac microvascular perfusion and improves insulin's microvascular response in the heart and large vessel function. We will also test a sub- hypothesis that women with T1DM have greater microvascular IR, but similar microvascular response to GLP- 1. We will utilize CEU to directly assess (1) the microvascular responses in skeletal and cardiac muscles to insulin in men and women with T1DM, comparing the two genders, and (2) whether GLP-1 infusion improves insulin-mediated skeletal and cardiac microvascular perfusion, large vessel compliance, and endothelial dysfunction in T1DM. The proposed studies will fill a current gap in knowledge regarding microvascular IR and tissue perfusion as well as vascular and systemic responses to GLP-1 in T1DM and the associated CVD risk gender disparity. If our hypotheses are validated, it will introduce a potential treatment avenue for mitigating IR and microvascular and macrovascular complications in T1DM. Project Narrative The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is substantially higher in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) compared with the general population, and there is convincing evidence of insulin resistance (IR) in T1DM which independently predicts diabetic complications like CVD. This research will examine the effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) on metabolic and microvascular IR and endothelial dysfunction in humans with T1DM. The results of this investigation will fill a gap in current knowledge concerning mechanisms underpinning IR and vascular complications in T1DM, with a particular emphasis on gender disparities as women with T1DM have poorer CVD outcomes, and introduce a potential treatment avenue to prevent microvascular and macrovascular complications in T1DM.",Effect of GLP-1 on microvascular insulin

"My ESSENCE - Mindfulness to Reduce Stress, Improve SIeep, and Reduce Cardiovascular Risk in African-Americans with Type 2 Diabetes Project Summary African-Americans have disproportionate rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the US. African-Americans with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) have twice the risk than non-Hispanic whites for developing CVD. Poorer sleep and greater chronic psychological stress may contribute to this additional risk. Consequently, African- Americans have worse glycemic control among those with diabetes and higher CVD risk. One promising approach to improving CVD risk in African-Americans is mindfulness meditation (MM). MM can potentially reduce cardiovascular risk through attention control, emotional regulation, and self-awareness. The overall purpose of this K01 training grant is for Dr. Alana Biggers to obtain research training and develop skills needed to become an independent investigator, and use those skills to adapt and evaluate an established MM curriculum (Mindfulness Based Therapy for Insomnia, or MBT-I). The specific aims are to: (1) adapt and refine the MBT-I curriculum for African-Americans with T2DM and incorporate text messaging; (2) conduct an 8- week, pilot randomized, controlled trial of the adapted curriculum with 68 African-Americans with T2DM; and (3) explore the impact of the intervention on cardiometabolic risk factors (blood pressure, glycosylated hemoglobin, and lipid profile) and inflammatory biomarkers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α). Primary outcomes will include sleep quality and perceived stress evaluated at baseline, 8, and 16 weeks. The proposed research design consists of a pilot study, utilizes mixed-methods research, and involves both primary data collection and analysis. This K01 training grant will provide Dr. Biggers career- building activities to further develop skills and a knowledge base in quantitative and qualitative methodology, health disparities research, and mobile health (mHealth)/behavioral health strategies in minority populations. With the guidance of an interdisciplinary mentorship team and institutional support, Dr. Biggers will receive the necessary assistance and training to work toward her long-term career goal of being an independent researcher with expertise in health disparities, mixed-methods, and mHealth behavioral research. Project Narrative The proposed research and training will allow Dr. Alana Biggers to obtain critical research skills and study a mindfulness meditation program designed to improve sleep and reduce stress in African-American adults with diabetes. If effective, this program may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease among African-Americans with type 2 diabetes who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease.","My ESSENCE - Mindfulness to

"Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans ABSTRACT  This mixed-methods study utilizes a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets and qualitative data collection, to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion and Spirituality (R/S) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) risk factors. CVD risk factors, especially high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes and depression, disproportionately affect African Americans in prevalence and/or severity, contributing to the higher associated mortality rate. Further, examining lifestyle choices (for example, diet and exercise) without appropriate sociocultural context does not provide practice-ready solutions on the manifestations, root causes and potential strategies for eliminating African American’s heightened CVD risks. As such, religion and spirituality (R/S) in the African American community have been acknowledged for their positive influence on social behaviors and emotional health, but have not been sufficiently examined for their role in attenuating or exacerbating physical health outcomes and in particular, the risks associated with CVD. Most research has compared the relationship between R/S and health outcomes by examining the specific denominations of their White participants, and blanketed Black participants’ religion to the “Black Church.” This approach disregards the diversity of beliefs, behaviors and ways of thinking found in the religious affiliation and denominations of African Americans. In a rare project that examined Black health outcomes in relation to specific religious affiliation/denomination, it was revealed that religious attendance had an inverse relationship based upon religious affiliation/denomination on black mortality rates not found in white participants. Thus, the standard of relying on religious affiliation and health studies based on White participants to determine expected outcomes for Black participants is likely to cause inaccuracies in research and interventions. The overarching goals of this research are to investigate the extent to which R/S is related to CVD risk factors (obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression) through the use of robust secondary and primary data analysis. The two project Aims will use theoretically-, research- and data-driven evidence to bolster efforts to decrease CVD risk factors and improve health outcomes for African Americans. Aim 1 utilizes structural equational modeling to determine if R/S has direct and indirect effects on CVD risk factors through health behaviors. Aim 2 establishes how the relationships manifest through first-hand accounts of the attributes of specific denominations on the health outcomes of its congregants, thus allowing participants to explain how the relationships found in Aim 1 are manifested-or not, in their daily and R/S life. The purpose of this research project is to not only identify the direct and indirect relationships between CVD risk factors and R/S, but to provide in depth knowledge of core attitudes, beliefs, organizational structures, and/or practices that facilitate or attenuate positive health outcomes for African Americans. The precision and nuance of our project’s strategies will fill in significant gaps in research and practice that can be a catalyst for evidence-based interventions that examines of community and religious institutions to support positive health outcomes for African American. Project Narrative The proposed mixed-methods study will utilize a dynamic combination of large secondary data sets (Add Health, National Survey of American Life and the Jackson Heart Study) and qualitative primary data collection to garner a sophisticated understanding of the relationships between Religion/Spirituality (R/S) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors- including obesity, diabetes, hypertension and depression for African Americans, while considering religious affiliation/denomination. Our strategy will fill in significant gaps in public research and effective community and religious based interventions by providing specific and nuanced data that can help build accuracy and researcher- participant trust. Considering R/S and CVD risk factors, Aim 1 addresses what relationships are there using secondary data analysis and Aim 2 establishes how the findings in Aim 1 are manifested (or not) through interviews and focus groups with African American community members and religious leaders and congregants.","Religion, Spirituality and CVD Risks:  A Focus on African Americans",9917586,R01MD011606,"['Affect ', ' Age Factors ', ' Attitude ', ' Behavior ', ' Belief ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Goals ', ' Group Interviews ', ' Health ', ' Health behavior ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Income ', ' Economic Income ', ' Economical Income ', ' Interview ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Religion ', ' Religious Belief ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Socialization ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' Thinking ', ' thoughts ', ' United States ', ' Gender ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Mediating ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Spiritualities ', ' Spirituality ', ' Trust ', ' Protestant ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Attenuated ', ' Nature ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' Dimensions ', ' Severities ', ' Source ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' Equation ', ' Church ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' religious group ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' religious ', ' Religion and Spirituality ', ' Categories ', ' Organization Charts ', ' organizational structure ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' informant ', ' diet and exercise ', ' Outcome ', ' Prevalence ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' community setting ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' Add Health ', ' National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health ', ' National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent to Adult Health ', ' socio-cultural ', ' sociocultural ', ' social culture ', ' ']",NIMHD,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2020,555097,0.21325356453542021
"Early Psychosocial Intervention and Child and Parent Cardiovascular Disease Risk Project Summary/Abstract The roots of cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is responsible for 32% of all deaths in the U.S., can be found during the early years, beginning perinatally. Although psychosocial interventions in populations across a wide age range have been shown to improve behavioral, mental health, and physical health outcomes, the development of effective early CVD prevention strategies and a deeper understanding of the ways in which psychosocial family factors interact to promote or reduce CVD risk are needed. The proposed project will build on the Family Foundations (FF) intervention, an ongoing NICHD-funded (PI: Feinberg, HD058529) randomized controlled trial of a perinatal intervention focused on coparenting, to examine the psychosocial pathways within the family that influence child and parent CVD risk. Additionally, we will examine potential intervention effects of FF on child and parent CVD risk. As part of the proposed project, we will augment the planned home visits (N = 294 families) which include questionnaire and family interaction data collection by adding the collection of baseline blood pressure, dried blood spot samples for the assessment of metabolic and inflammatory CVD risk markers, and important potential moderators of CVD risk. First, using these data and taking advantage of data available from three previous waves of data collection, we will develop models of interactive psychosocial influences on parent and child CVD risk. Specifically, this will include the consideration of child factors (e.g., behavioral problems), parent factors (e.g., depression), and family climate factors (e.g., parenting quality, family chaos and conflict), which we expect to interact and also contribute to CVD risk in unique ways. Second, we will test the extent to which these child, parent, and family factors mediate any effect of the FF intervention on CVD. Third, we will examine whether key external risk factors (parents’ lifetime socioeconomic status (SES) and adversity and children’s lifetime SES and birth weight) moderate any associations between child, parent, and family factors and CVD risk and whether they moderate main effects of the intervention on CVD risk. This research will be conducted by an interdisciplinary team of scientists who specialize in intervention research, psychosocial influences on health, minimally invasive field-based biomarker collection, and socioeconomic health disparities. The data resulting from this project will increase our understanding of the pathways through which the psychosocial family environment influences CVD risk and whether a psychosocial intervention can reduce CVD risk. By examining the moderating role of lifetime adversity and SES, the study will further inform future intervention research to unlock the potential of such interventions to reduce SES-based CVD disparities. Project Narrative The origins of cardiovascular disease can be found in early life. This project aims to understand how mechanisms within the family influence physiological risk factors for cardiovascular disease among children and parents. We will do this by assessing parents and children part of an ongoing coparenting intervention trial, which will furthermore allow us to study potential effects of such an intervention on parent and child cardiovascular disease risk, and may inform future prevention efforts.",Early Psychosocial Intervention and Child and Parent Cardiovascular Disease Risk,9841979,R01HL137809,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Aggressive behavior ', ' Aggression ', ' Atherosclerosis ', ' Atheroscleroses ', ' Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease ', ' atheromatosis ', ' atherosclerotic disease ', ' atherosclerotic vascular disease ', ' Autopsy ', ' necropsy ', ' postmortem ', ' Birth Weight ', ' Blood ', ' Blood Reticuloendothelial System ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Rearing ', ' Parenting ', ' Parenting behavior ', ' childrearing ', ' Climate ', ' Meteorological Climate ', ' climatic ', ' Conflict (Psychology) ', ' Conflict ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Environment ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Family ', ' Family dynamics ', ' family structure/dynamics ', ' Fetus ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Low Birth Weight Infant ', ' low birth weight ', ' low birth weight infant human ', ' low birthweight ', ' Infection ', ' Inflammation ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Longevity ', ' Length of Life ', ' life span ', ' lifespan ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Stress ', ' Psychological Stress ', ' Psychologic Stress ', ' Testing ', ' United States ', ' Measures ', ' Mediating ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Peripartum ', ' Perinatal ', ' improved ', ' Chronic ', ' Physiologic ', ' Physiological ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' root ', ' Plant Roots ', ' Funding ', ' behavioral problem ', ' Problem behavior ', ' Randomized Controlled Trials ', ' Metabolic ', ' Spottings ', ' Exposure to ', ' Inflammatory ', ' Life ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' Home ', ' Home environment ', ' Pattern ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' experience ', ' interpersonal conflict ', ' expectation ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' Preventative strategy ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' Prevention ', ' Interventional trial ', ' Intervention Trial ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' parent influence ', ' parental influence ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Child Mental Health ', ' Data ', ' NICHD ', "" National Institute of Children's Health and Human Development "", ' National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ', ' Collection ', ' Observation research ', ' Observation study ', ' Observational research ', ' Observational Study ', ' Risk Marker ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' post intervention ', ' House Call ', ' home visit ', ' Home visitation ', ' cost ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' family influence ', ' perinatal intervention ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' Psychosocial Issues ', ' Psychosocial Influences ', ' minimally invasive ', ' bio-markers ', ' biologic marker ', ' biomarker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' intervention effect ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' maternal adiposity ', ' maternal obesity ', ' experiment ', ' experimental research ', ' experimental study ', ' ']",NHLBI,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R01,2020,445173,0.23453891713942904
"P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations Project Summary/Abstract The NYU Meyers College of Nursing is uniquely poised to propose a P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations to promote nursing research in metabolic syndrome (MetS) and related multiple chronic conditions (MCC). Guided by a precision health ecological framework, this center aims to (1) promote innovative research on the complexity, relatedness, biodiversity, and impact on individuals and families of MetS and MCC using a precision health ecological perspective, including biomarkers (genetics/genomics), ancestry, community, and environmental factors and the NINR CDE; (2) develop and sustain a research infrastructure to support and accelerate early career scientists in exploring MetS and MCC in diverse individuals and families from a precision health ecological perspective; and (3) facilitate the development of sustainable interdisciplinary collaborative teams dedicated to advancing the science of MCC by obtaining external funding and conducting impactful research. Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a set of inter-related health conditions placing individuals at serious risk for T2D and CVD. MetS is a prodromal state that sets the stage for CVD and T2D. Hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and obesity are common factors that comprise MetS. MetS is present in ~ 35% of adults in the US. A family history of MCC that includes type 2 diabetes (T2D), hypertension, and early cardiovascular disease (CVD) greatly increases the chance that an individual will develop MetS. Genetics and environment play a role in chronic conditions; this is particularly true of MetS. Other causes of MetS and associated T2D and CVD risk include genetic susceptibility, family history, low education and socioeconomic status, increased body mass index (BMI), and lifestyle factors, especially sedentary lifestyle/lack of regular physical activity; diet high in refined carbohydrates, sugar, and saturated fat; cigarette smoking; and substance use 1-6. Research that expands our understanding of biomarkers, lifestyle, contextual, and environmental impacts on phenotypic expression of MetS and related MCC among diverse, vulnerable populations is lacking and critically needed. The infrastructure will include 3 Cores-Administrative Core guided by an Executive Committee and an External Advisory Committee; Pilot Administrative Core with Pilot Feasibility Funding and a Scientific Review Committee; Precision Technology Resource Core, and an Enrichment Program. Two pilot projects will address symptom clusters and biomarkers of MetS related to sleep duration and fatigue. The NYU Meyers College of Nursing has faculty investigators and research scientists with programs of biobehavioral research, funded by NIH, CDC, NSF, and foundations ($9.3 million in direct costs), that address risk, management, and intervention for MCC. These researchers will serve as mentors, collaborators, and resources for the Center pilot PIs and their collaborators. The Center will allow for more individualized care and extend nursing science by offering biomarker, genetic/genomic, biobehavioral, lifestyle, and environmental explanations that will inform nursing care for diverse populations with symptoms of MetS. Project Narrative The goal of the NYU Rory Meyers College of Nursing P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations is to develop nurse scientists, and interdisciplinary teams dedicated to research that will expand knowledge on metabolic syndrome (MetS) and related multiple chronic conditions (MCC), their biological mechanisms, modifiable risk factors, and best interventions to reduce or eliminate MCC burden in diverse adult populations, within the context of individual, family and community.",P20 Exploratory Center for Precision Health in Diverse Populations,9940767,P20NR018075,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Elderly ', ' advanced age ', ' elders ', ' geriatric ', ' late life ', ' later life ', ' older adult ', ' older person ', ' senior citizen ', ' Biology ', ' Carbohydrates ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S.) ', ' CDC ', ' Centers for Disease Control ', ' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control ', ' United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Communities ', ' Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Adult-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Resistant Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Maturity-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' NIDDM ', ' Non-Insulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes ', ' Noninsulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Slow-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Stable Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T2 DM ', ' T2D ', ' T2DM ', ' Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 2 diabetes ', ' Type II Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type II diabetes ', ' adult onset diabetes ', ' ketosis resistant diabetes ', ' maturity onset diabetes ', ' type 2 DM ', ' type II DM ', ' type two diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Ecology ', ' Environmental Science ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Faculty ', ' Family ', ' Fatigue ', ' Lack of Energy ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Patient Care ', ' Patient Care Delivery ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mentors ', ' Morbidity -

"Intersection of Material-Need Insecurities and HIV and Cardiovascular Health Lack of means to consistently meet basic material needs results in poor health, particularly for those already managing chronic conditions such as HIV or cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although addressing material needs insecurities likely can be cost-effective by preventing acquisition of or exacerbation of chronic diseases, little is known about how these material needs work together to harm health. We propose to use an intersectional perspective and examine the combined effects of four different types of insecurity related to basic material needs (food, housing, financial, and healthcare) on HIV and CVD outcomes among both men and women. Material- need insecurities include absolute insufficiency of resources (hunger, homelessness, inadequate finances, no health insurance), poor quality of resources ((e.g., poor diets, healthcare coverage), uncertainty of consistently meeting future needs, and having to engage in socially unacceptable means to meet needs. An intersectional perspective allows us to examine how different combinations of these insecurities affect health in a non-additive way and may lead to more effective interventions that target co-occurring needs simultaneously, rather than investing in narrowly focused piecemeal solutions. Specifically, we aim to determine: 1) the separate and intersectional effects of four specific material-need insecurities (food, housing, financial, and healthcare insecurity) on HIV and cardiovascular outcomes using latent profile and latent transition analyses; 2) the intermediate outcomes that may be on causal paths between material-need insecurities and HIV and CVD risk outcomes using a convergent parallel mixed method design; and 3) factors that moderate effects of material- need insecurities on HIV and cardiovascular outcomes using convergent parallel mixed methods. We hypothesize that: 1) intersectional effects will more accurately identify individuals at risk for worse outcomes compared to independent effects for both HIV-infected and uninfected individuals; 2) relationships of material- need insecurities with HIV and cardiovascular outcomes are mediated by health behavior (medication non- adherence, low physical activity, missed clinic visits), mental health (stress, depression, poverty-related stigma), and physiologic (poor nutrition, inflammation) paths; and 3) inter- and intra-personal resources (e.g., social support, resilience) mitigate impacts of material-need insecurities. To address these aims, we will leverage the extensive physical exam, laboratory and survey data from the MACS and WIHS Combined Cohort Study (MWCCS), and add survey measures and blood collection in a longitudinal five-year study among over 3000 HIV-infected and at-risk MWCCS participants. We will also conduct a longitudinal qualitative study (N = 42) in three MWCCS sites. Integrating findings from this mixed-methods research will facilitate a deeper understanding of the experience, distribution, intersections, health implications, and mitigating factors of multiple material-need insecurities experienced by people living with or at-risk for HIV in the US. Subsequently, we plan to develop tailored, multi-modal interventions which can target at-risk populations and associated mechanisms. Project Narrative When people lack the means to consistently meet their material needs for food, housing, finances, and healthcare, their health suffers, particularly for those already managing chronic diseases such as HIV or diabetes. The proposed study brings together a multidisciplinary team of experts for a five-year study among over 3000 men and women living with or at risk for HIV to understand how these unmet material needs work together to harm HIV and cardiovascular disease health.

"CV Wizard: Does a Prioritized, Point-of-Care Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Guideline-Based CVD Risk Factor Control in Safety Net Clinics? PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT: Substantial progress in reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality would be achieved if evidence-based guidelines for CVD risk factor control were implemented consistently in primary care settings. Electronic health record (EHR)-based clinical decision support (CDS) systems that identify uncontrolled CVD risk factors and provide individualized care recommendations improved rates of guideline-concordant CVD care in large, integrated healthcare settings, but little is known about how effective such CDS may be in safety net community health centers (CHCs). CHCs' socioeconomically vulnerable patients have far worse CVD risk factor control and higher rates of major CVD events than the general population. Implementing CDS that leads to improved CVD risk factor control in CHCs could reduce national disparities in CVD outcomes, but CHCs rarely have the resources to develop sophisticated CDS, and very few currently have such systems for CVD care. The proposed study is designed to address this. We will randomize 60 CHCs with a shared EHR to immediate vs. delayed implementation of a sophisticated CDS system that provides point-of-care CVD care recommendations to the primary care provider and the patient, and has been proven highly successful in large, integrated care settings. Before implementing the CDS, we will ask CHC patients and providers about the particular patient needs and perspectives and clinic workflows likely to influence adoption and impact of the CDS in CHCs. This input will inform development of CHC care team training strategies, and adaptation of the patient-facing aspects of the CDS system. We will measure adoption of the CDS, and impact of its use over time on CVD risk scores and risk factor control (blood pressure, HbA1c, lipid levels; aspirin use; smoking; body mass index) in high-CVD risk CHC patients. We will also conduct a mixed methods process evaluation, to identify facilitators and barriers to use of the CDS, and to iteratively develop and test strategies for supporting its adoption and ongoing use in CHC workflows. We anticipate that this intervention could (a) improve CVD care among low-income CHC patients, (b) reduce CVD care disparities between CHC populations and national rates, and (c) facilitate greater CHC patient engagement in CVD treatment decision-making and prioritization. The proposed work directly responds to PAR 15-279 goals: it addresses gaps in guideline- based care in high-risk populations with targeted, innovative, multi-level strategies; considers setting-specific needs; and supports patient engagement. Our team's research experience and established partnerships with key healthcare system stakeholders increase the likelihood of project success. Results will yield EHR- agnostic CDS tools for use by any CHC with an implementation guide, build knowledge about how to minimize disparities in CVD care and outcomes using scalable CDS strategies, and help translate investments in informatics into clinical benefit for millions of high-risk, low-income Americans. PROJECT NARRATIVE: This project aims to reduce disparities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factor control and in rates of heart attacks and strokes among the low-income, racially / ethnically diverse Americans who receive primary care at safety net community health centers (CHCs). To achieve this important objective, we will adapt a successful clinical decision support (CDS) system currently used in CVD care at several large, integrated health care systems, to meet the patient needs and workflow processes of 60 CHCs. We will determine if use of this CDS improves CVD care, reduces disparities in CVD care and outcomes, and increases patient engagement in CVD treatment choices, in CHCs. Results of this randomized trial will help accelerate the translation of major investments in health informatics systems into substantial clinical benefits for large numbers of high-risk, low-income patients. Results will also provide a template for CVD care improvement that can be spread to other CHCs and extended to other clinical conditions.","CV Wizard: Does a Prioritized, Point-of-Care Clinical Decision Support Tool Improve Guideline-Based CVD Risk Factor Control in Safety Net Clinics?",9879758,R01HL133793,"['Adoption ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Affect ', ' Algorithms ', ' Aspirin ', ' Acetylsalicylic Acid ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Community Developments ', ' Decision Making ', ' Goals ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Heart Rate ', ' Cardiac Chronotropism ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Incidence ', ' indexing ', ' Investments ', ' Leadership ', ' Lipids ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Myocardial Infarction ', ' Cardiac infarction ', ' Myocardial Infarct ', ' cardiac infarct ', ' coronary attack ', ' coronary infarct ', ' coronary infarction ', ' heart attack ', ' heart infarct ', ' heart infarction ', ' Online Systems ', ' On-Line Systems ', ' online computer ', ' web based ', ' Patients ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Public Health ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Risk Management ', ' Smoking ', ' Stroke ', ' Apoplexy ', ' Brain Vascular Accident ', ' Cerebral Stroke ', ' Cerebrovascular Apoplexy ', ' Cerebrovascular Stroke ', ' brain attack ', ' cerebral vascular accident ', ' cerebrovascular accident ', ' Technology ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' Community Health Centers ', ' Satellite Centers ', ' Neighborhood Health Center ', ' Caring ', ' Custom ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' satisfaction ', ' uptake ', ' integrated health system ', ' integrated healthcare systems ', ' Integrated Health Care Systems ', ' integrated delivery of healthcare ', ' Integrated Delivery of Health Care ', ' Knowledge ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' Protocol ', ' Protocols documentation ', ' System ', ' Clinical Decision Support Systems ', ' Visit ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Informatics ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' General Public ', ' General Population ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Health Informatics ', ' consumer informatics ', ' Public Health Informatics ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' BMI percentile ', ' BMI z-score ', ' Quetelet index ', ' Body mass index ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' randomisation ', ' randomization ', ' randomly assigned ', ' Randomized ', ' Centers for Population Health ', ' Characteristics ', ' Process ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' point of care ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' Evidence based practice guidelines ', ' evidence based recommendations ', ' evidence based guidelines ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' patient centered ', ' patient oriented ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' primary care setting ', ' public health priorities ', ' Randomization trial ', ' randomized trial ', ' arm ', ' Precision care ', ' individualized care ', ' individualized patient care ', ' personalized patient care ', ' personalized care ', ' support tools ', ' treatment choice ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' high risk group ', ' high risk population ', ' secondary analysis ', ' primary care provider ', ' care providers ', ' healthcare settings ', ' health care settings ', ' health care outcomes ', ' healthcare outcomes ', ' care outcomes ', ' patient engagement ', ' clinical decision support ', ' ']",NHLBI,KAISER FOUNDATION RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2020,645631,0.29304808153068373
"Extending a Caribbean Based Cohort to Promote US-Caribbean Comparisons to Facilitate Research Addressing Black Health Disparities PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Fifty percent of Non-Hispanic Black immigrants in the United States (US) originate from the Caribbean. Thus the health of US and Caribbean populations are closely intertwined due to both regional proximity and the high volume of Caribbean immigration to the US3. US and Caribbean Blacks also share disease burden; cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) account for their greatest health disparities-- killing more Black individuals in the US and the Caribbean than any other ethnic/racial group. Yet, there is a paucity of cancer and CVD comparative research between the US-born Black American and African-Caribbean sub-groups. While the NIH has invested in studying US minority/immigrant populations, comparisons with Caribbean cohorts are needed to untangle the effect of biological, environmental, behavioral, and cultural health care system determinants of CVD and cancer risk and outcomes. In partnership with the University of the West Indies (UWI), the African Caribbean Cancer Consortium (AC3) is already making headway into expanding an existing population-based cohort for cancer and CVD research in Jamaica. The Jamaica Health and Lifestyle Survey (JHLS-III), conducted in 2016-17, is a national representative sample of over 3000 persons. The JHLS-III collected bio-specimens and epidemiological data on CVD, cancer, other chronic diseases and their risk factors, and medical history. To the best of our knowledge, there are no other nationally representative population-based cohorts in the Caribbean specifically targeting cancer combined with other chronic diseases. With an NCI-P20 award, the AC3, an NCI-Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program supported consortium at Fox Chase Cancer Center and UWI have established a Caribbean Regional Center of Research Excellence in Cardiometabolic Disease and Cancer. This proposal will be a natural extension of this project by expanding the JHLS-III and building the data mining, storage and analytics infrastructure needed to harness and share data from epidemiological measures and biospecimens to promote comparative research in cancer and cardiometabolic disease. This proposed infrastructure building project will harness and prepare multi-level data for future US-Caribbean comparative studies. We propose to optimize enrollment and retention of Caribbean nationals in cohort studies by (a) obtaining multi-stakeholder input and feedback from community health nurses/field workers and JHLS-III 2016/17 cohort participants to refine targeted enrollment and retention strategies; and (b) evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy relative to historical enrollment and retention rates. We will repurpose and expand the JHLS-III into a robust longitudinal cohort of 8,000 participants, collect and store biospecimens, socioecological and health status data in order to answer questions about NCD (i.e. cancer and CVD) risk and outcomes. We will establish a secure data integration and sharing platform that will enable linkages of the Jamaica cohort with the CAP3 study and other Caribbean and US-based cohorts, and conduct preliminary analytics for data verification and harmonization. PROJECT NARRATIVE Given the diversity of the US Black population and their disproportionate cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality, comparative studies of African American/immigrant Black populations with Black populations of their native countries must be prioritized to address health disparities in the US. The goal of this proposal is to repurpose and expand an existing Caribbean-based survey into a robust longitudinal cohort that will support US-Caribbean research to facilitate the identification of Black health disparities. This study will produce harmonized data and biospecimen collection methods; subsequently, facilitating an increase in data and biospecimen sharing and comparability with US-based national datasets.",Extending a Caribbean Based Cohort to Promote US-Caribbean Comparisons to Facilitate Research Addressing Black Health Disparities,9886085,R01MD013347,"['Award ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Community Health Nursing ', ' Clinical Specialist in Community Health Nursing ', ' Community Health Nurse ', ' Community Health Nurse Specialist ', ' Comparative Study ', ' Data Collection ', ' Delaware ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Feedback ', ' Field Workers ', ' Fieldworker ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Heterogeneity ', ' Immigration ', ' Incidence ', ' Interviewer ', ' Jamaica ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Mouthwash ', ' Persons ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' New Jersey ', ' New York ', ' Philadelphia ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Surveys ', ' Survey Instrument ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Urine ', ' Urine Urinary System ', ' West Indies ', ' Caribbean Islands ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Dataset ', ' Data Set ', ' base ', ' Area ', ' Variation ', ' Variant ', ' Biological ', ' Caribbean ', ' Caribbean Sea Region ', ' West Indies Region ', ' Caribbean region ', ' Link ', ' Individual ', ' African ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Personal Medical History ', ' Personal Medical History Epidemiology ', ' Medical History ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Immigrant ', ' instrument ', ' Research Specimen ', ' Specimen ', ' NHANES ', ' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey ', ' programs ', ' black Caribbean ', ' black carib ', ' African Caribbean ', ' Country ', ' cancer risk ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' metropolitan ', ' cohort ', ' Participant ', ' Sampling ', ' response ', ' Genomics ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' BRFSS ', ' Behavior Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' datamining ', ' data mining ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Subgroup ', ' COBRE ', ' Center of Biomedical Research Excellence ', ' Centers of Research Excellence ', ' Collection ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Fox Chase Cancer Center ', ' Non-Hispanic ', ' Nonhispanic ', ' Not Hispanic or Latino ', ' Behavioral ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' data integration ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' comparative ', ' population based ', ' population health ', ' surveillance study ', ' Epidemiological data ', ' Epidemiology data ', ' epidemiologic data ', ' data sharing ', ' Secure ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' Data Analytics ', ' Jamaican ', ' ethnically diverse ', ' ethnic diversity ', ' Long-term cohort ', ' Longterm cohort ', ' Longitudinal cohort ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' Infrastructure ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' sharing platform ', ' evaluate effectiveness ', ' effectiveness evaluation ', ' ']",NIMHD,RESEARCH INST OF FOX CHASE CAN CTR,R01,2020,671771,0.1628325227927161
"Reducing Cardiovascular Risk in Perimenopausal Latinas: Pilot Study of a Multi-Component Intervention PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death among women. Risk of CVD increases substantially during perimenopause, the critical window of 6-8 years before a woman’s final menstrual period. Increasing evidence suggests that Latinas have a significantly worse CVD risk factor profile than non-Hispanic women, which can be attributed to multiple sociocultural and environmental factors (e.g., lower socioeconomic position, discrimination, stress). These factors are related to CVD through their influence on health behaviors, as well as potential mechanisms involving inflammatory and neuroendocrine pathways. Although behavioral intervention research targeting CVD risk during perimenopause emerged over the past decade, no studies were designed to intervene on behavioral influences to decrease biological CVD risk among perimenopausal Latinas. Using the National Institute of Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) Framework, we will address the sociocultural and built environments and intervene on behavioral influences to decrease biologic CVD risk among perimenopausal Latinas. The aim of this investigation is to examine feasibility and initial efficacy of a behavioral intervention led by community health workers to a) decrease the primary outcomes of biologic CVD risk factors (blood pressure [BP], arterial stiffness, lipids, blood glucose); b) improve secondary outcomes (health behaviors: nutrition, physical activity, sleep, coping strategies) and other biological factors (adiposity, inflammatory and stress biomarkers, vasomotor symptoms) from baseline to 6- and 12-month follow-up. We will recruit participants from two community groups: one group will be randomly assigned to complete the intervention; the other will be a wait-list control. This intervention has 3 phases: 12 weekly sessions (Phase I: education, physical activity, stress management, coping skills training) followed by 3 monthly sessions of continued support (Phase II); and finally 6 months of skill maintenance on their own (Phase III). The long-term goal of this award is to develop Dr. Cortés’ independence as an investigator, leading a program of research dedicated to improving women’s cardiovascular health, and to implement interventions for prevention and self-management of CVD in perimenopausal women, particularly Latinas. The proposed K23 will support her development through mentorship and training in: 1) community-engaged research; 2) clinical trial design, implementation, and evaluation; 3) the effect of behavioral interventions on biologic outcomes; and 4) professional development skills in leadership, publication, and grantsmanship. To accomplish her research aims and training goals, Dr. Cortés has assembled an interdisciplinary team of scientists with expertise in community engagement, intervention design, clinical trial analysis, sociocultural and biological measures, and career development mentorship. This research holds potential to accelerate greatly the acquisition of knowledge related to CVD risk among perimenopausal Latinas, and the impact of behavioral interventions to reduce CVD risk in this underserved population. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed research is relevant to public health because perimenopausal Latinas remain considerably less likely than non-Hispanic White women to meet physical activity and dietary guidelines, or be aware that CVD is the leading cause of death among women. Because Hispanic/Latinos are the largest ethnic minority in the United States (US), progress regarding CVD risk among perimenopausal Latinas may lead to significant improvement in the overall CVD burden in the US. Furthermore, the proposed research may provide insight on the interplay among sociocultural and built environments, behavioral influences and biological influences contributing to women’s overall

"Cardiovascular Health Associations with Minority stress: Biobehavioral Evaluations and self-Reported Sociopsychological outcomes by SOGI status (CHAMBERS) PROJECT SUMMARY Sexual minority and gender minority (SGM) individuals experience a wide variety of health disparities compared to their non-SGM peers. These disparities include higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors tied to psychological distress (e.g., depression, stress), behavioral CVD risk factors (smoking, physical inactivity, diet), and clinical CVD risk factors (e.g., diabetes, obesity, hypertension, high cholesterol). Existing SGM population health studies rely primarily on self-reported measures to document CVD risk factors and disease prevalence, thus ignoring undiagnosed clinical CVD risk factors present among younger populations. Though these studies have laid important groundwork to document the existence of SGM CVD disparities, the absence of objective measures of CVD risk factors and outcomes therefore remains a critical gap in the SGM health literature. Minority stress theory (MST) is the leading framework proposed to explain the wide-ranging health disparities observed among marginalized populations. In MST models, structural stigma (e.g., anti-SGM laws) is viewed as leading to and exacerbating distal (discrimination) and proximal stressors (internalized stigma, perceived stigma). These stigma-related stressors can contribute to poor SGM health via enhanced psychosocial distress and CVD risk behaviors. These pathways add to the higher chronic stress burden associated with the development of clinical CVD risk factors. Increasingly, MST- derived frameworks also reflect that resilience promoting factors at multiple levels (e.g., identity affirmation, social support) can decrease the harmful population health effects of stigma. Applying a theoretically-driven intersectional lens, we propose to build on studies describing the existence of SGM CVD disparities by contextualizing these disparities across person, place, and time in relation to social power systems. We propose an ancillary study to CARDIA to collect sexual orientation and gender identity (SOGI) data as well as measures of SGM stigma and resilience promoting factors in the Year 35 CARDIA exam. Through an innovative collaboration, we also propose to pool CARDIA data with data from the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study on Latinos (HCHS/SOL) cohort to address the following compelling and timely Specific Aims: Aim 1: Assess how behavioral and clinical CVD risk factors vary by SGM status over the life course. Aim 2: Among SGM participants (n=734), investigate how stigma and resilience promoting factors at the internalized and interpersonal levels associated with behavioral and clinical CVD risk factors. Aim 3: Determine the influence of SGM structural stigma on behavioral and clinical CVD risk factors. Overall, the impact of these studies will be to advance CVD epidemiology and to enhance the evidence base to ameliorate SGM CVD health disparities and promote SGM CVD health equity at the intersections of multiple marginalized identities. PROJECT NARRATIVE  Sexual minority and gender minority (SGM) individuals are more likely to have poor physical health than their non-SGM peers. In this proposal, we will test if SGM people are more likely to have higher levels of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors than non-SGM people and determine if stigma against SGM people contributes to increased risk for poor CVD outcomes in these populations at the intersections of race/ethnicity, sex, and socioeconomic status. As part of our larger goal to not only decrease SGM CVD but also to enhance SGM cardiovascular health equity, we will investigate if resilience promoting factors can mediate the harmful health effects of stigma to improve the health of diverse SGM populations.",Cardiovascular Health Associations with Minority stress: Biobehavioral Evaluations and self-Reported Sociopsychological outcomes by SOGI status (CHAMBERS),10053165,R01HL149866,"['Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cholesterol ', ' Communities ', ' Mental Depression ', ' depression ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Household ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Incidence ', ' Laws ', ' Life Cycle Stages ', ' Life Cycle ', ' life course ', ' Literature ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Smoking ', ' Social Power ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' County ', ' Measures ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Mediating ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' socio-economic position ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' enhancing factor ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Cardiac artery ', ' Heart artery ', ' Coronary artery ', ' Distal ', ' Clinical ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' Link ', ' Distress ', ' Individual ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Evaluation Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Collaborations ', ' Investigation ', ' System ', ' physical health ', ' physical conditioning ', ' psychosocial ', ' cardiovascular disease epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' stressor ', ' behavioral measure ', ' behavioral measurement ', ' behavior measurement ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' Self-Report ', ' Patient Self-Report ', ' methods to study multiple-level influences ', ' multi-level analysis ', ' multi-level model ', ' multilevel model ', ' multilevel modeling ', ' multilevel analysis ', ' psychological distress ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' theories ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Chronic stress ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' sex ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' biobehavioral ', ' biobehavior ', ' Minority ', ' adjudicate ', ' resilience ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' aged ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' lenses ', ' lens ', ' evidence base ', ' health equity ', ' population health ', ' clinical risk ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' gender minority ', ' Same-sex ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' community center ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' minority communities ', ' clinical development ', ' ']",NHLBI,NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY AT CHICAGO,R01,2020,835024,0.2193394114820777
"The SMART-CV Study: Systems Modeling Approaches to Reducing Disparities in Cardiovascular Diseases ABSTRACT Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) represent the leading cause of death in the US and are costly to the nation. Despite ongoing prevention efforts, socially and economically disadvantaged populations continue to bear the highest burden of CVDs. There is growing evidence that social determinants of health can play a role in producing such disparities in CVD. Yet current interventions designed to reduce disparities in CVD seldom focus on the social determinants of cardiovascular health across multiple domains and levels of influence but tend to focus on individual-level factors. Furthermore, when designing interventions, policymakers have to consider the trade-offs between interventions that maximize health in the general population and those that minimize health disparities and failure to reach a balance between these can result in increased health disparities and suboptimal population health. Therefore, to efficiently reduce disparities in CVD—coronary heart diseases and stroke, there is a pressing need for assisting policy decision-making in the design of sustainable and affordable targeted health interventions that integrate social factors across domains and levels of influence and which targets the socially and economically disadvantaged populations. This K01 proposal will apply several analytic approaches including key informant interviews, the synthetic control method and simulation modeling and systems science (SMSS) methods to evaluate the impact and costs of intervention strategies that have the potential to efficiently reduce CVD health disparities. To carry out this proposal, Dr. Nianogo will (1) identify interventions and policies that are implemented in California which focused on the social determinants of cardiovascular health across multiple domains and levels of influence, (2) investigate the impact of three societal policy interventions on CVD incidence; (3) develop a computer simulation model to project the long-term impact and cost-effectiveness of interventions and policies targeting disadvantaged subpopulations, high-risk subpopulations. Findings from this study help identify targeted health interventions that have the potential to reduce health disparities in CVD and inform policy decision-making.  This K01 proposal builds on the candidate’s previous research that developed a computer simulation model (Virtual Los Angeles Cohort—ViLA) to study the prevalence and incidence of obesity and type 2 diabetes among a representative sample of U.S. persons born in Los Angeles and followed from birth to age 65. The proposal will be pursued within the context of a strong mentorship that has adequate extensive experience and expertise on intervention research, CVDs, health disparities and simulation modeling that is necessary for the success of this project. UCLA provides an adequate environment to conduct such innovative research. Throughout this proposal, the candidate will gain skills in SMSS and CVD disparities research; these skills are critical to providing Dr. Nianogo with the means and knowledge to become a successful independent investigator in computational epidemiology and SMSS and to secure future R01 funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE Disparities in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) abound. There is growing evidence that social determinants of health across several domains and levels of influence over the life course can play a role in producing such disparities in CVD.

"DORMIR: Determinants, Outcomes, Responses and Markers of  Insufficient sleep in Rural-Urban settings Project Summary The widening gap in all-cause and CVD-mortality and morbidity rates in rural and urban America is at an all- time high. Latino/as, the largest minority ethnic group in the U.S., appear to be most affected by rural-urban divide in CVD outcomes, as they are disproportionately burdened by CVD risk (overweight/obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes) and CVD mortality (20%, 2nd leading cause of death among Latino/as) relative to other racial/ethnic groups. Unlike other groups where individuals in rural and urban areas have differing CVD risk, rural and urban Latino/as have similarly high rates of CVD risk. Although, healthy diets/ nutrition, smoking cessation, and regular physical activity are linked to CVD risk, they have not been very effective in reducing the CVD burden among racial/ethnic groups, specifically among Latino/as. Several studies indicate that insufficient sleep (<7hrs./day) explains a significant amount of the CVD burden among Latino/as. Preliminary evidence indicates that insufficient sleep may contribute to the observed CVD burden among Latino/as, as Latino/as have greater odds of experiencing insufficient sleep compared with non-Hispanic whites. Evidence also shows that insufficient sleep, which is associated with potentially life-threatening CVD, is a key modifiable risk factor with great potential to reduce health disparities. However, it is unclear what factors contribute to insufficient sleep (IS) disparities and IS-related CVD burden among rural and urban Latino/as. To address these gaps, we will enroll 525 Latino/as in rural and urban communities to participate in home-based studies using novel mHealth devices. The multidisciplinary team will: 1) identify behavioral, genetic, psychosocial, and environmental factors that are associated with insufficient sleep and IS-related CVD and 2) assess effects of insufficient sleep on CVD risk markers (obesity, blood pressure, lipid profile, and fasting plasma glucose/ HbA1C) and inflammatory risk markers (IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α). This study will provide multi-level evidence supporting epidemiological findings of greater rates of insufficient sleep among Latino/as, which may explain their disproportionate burden of CVD risk. It will also assess whether and why rural and urban differences in IS exist among Latino/as and how that may lead to IS-related CVD outcomes. These data will provide: 1) the foundation for interventions to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep on CVD health outcomes, 2) evidence to delineate factors underlying insufficient sleep and CVD burden among Latino/as in rural and urban settings, and 3) a possible explanation of behavioral, genetic, environmental and psychosocial determinants of insufficient sleep and related CVD risk factors in rural and urban Latino/as. Findings can lead to actionable clinical, lifestyle, and policy interventions to improve Latino health. Project Narrative This proposal is predicated upon compelling data that Latino/as exhibit a greater risk of insufficient sleep (<7 hours) compared with whites, and that insufficient sleep is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease and inflammation. It will provide multi-level evidence on behavioral, genetic, psychosocial and environmental determinants of insufficient sleep and sleep-related CVD risk and inflammation markers among rural and urban Latino/as. These data will provide the foundation for interventions to mitigate adverse effects of insufficient sleep on health outcomes.","DORMIR: Determinants, Outcomes, Responses and Markers of  Insufficient sleep in Rural-Urban settings",9976872,R01HL152453,"['Affect ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Air ', ' Americas ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Blood Pressure ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Communities ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Environment ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Foundations ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Behavioral Genetics ', ' Genetic Determinants of Behavior ', ' behavior genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Glucose ', ' D-Glucose ', ' Dextrose ', ' Health ', ' Glycosylated hemoglobin A ', ' Glycohemoglobin A ', ' Hb A1 ', ' Hb A1a+b ', ' Hb A1c ', ' HbA1 ', ' HbA1c ', ' Hemoglobin A(1) ', ' hemoglobin A1c ', ' Household ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Inflammation ', ' instrumentation ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Interleukin-6 ', ' B cell differentiation factor ', ' B cell stimulating factor 2 ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor ', ' B-Cell Differentiation Factor-2 ', ' B-Cell Stimulatory Factor-2 ', ' BCDF ', ' BSF-2 ', ' BSF2 ', ' HPGF ', ' Hepatocyte-Stimulating Factor ', ' Hybridoma Growth Factor ', ' IFN-beta 2 ', ' IFNB2 ', ' IL-6 ', ' IL6 Protein ', ' MGI-2 ', ' Myeloid Differentiation-Inducing Protein ', ' Plasmacytoma Growth Factor ', ' interferon beta 2 ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Length of Stay ', ' Number of Days in Hospital ', ' hospital days ', ' hospital length of stay ', ' hospital stay ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' Lipids ', ' Methodology ', ' Morbidity -

"The Development and Implementation of a Culturally-Congruent Educational Film designed for PLWHIV to Address Patients' Trauma Histories, Barriers to Care, and CVD Risk Reduction Abstract/Project Summary (Parent Award) Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has emerged as an increasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Now that HIV is considered a manageable chronic disease, the identification and treatment of comorbid medical conditions including CVD are increasingly the focus of research and clinical attention. What is missing, however, is yet another critical component of care for PLWHIV: integrated care for histories of trauma. Experiences of trauma increase the likelihood of HIV infection as well as CVD risk, yet health care for PLWHIV is rarely coordinated to address these three intersecting issues of HIV, CVD, and trauma, particularly among those disproportionately affected by HIV, i.e., ethnic minority patients. Histories of trauma among PLWHIV are associated with inconsistent treatment adherence and non-adherence, and trauma history alone is associated with poor CVD outcomes. Failure to address trauma poses significant barriers to the adoption of CVD risk strategies among PLWHIV. Health systems that coordinate and integrate care across HIV and chronic conditions such as CVD may provide the infrastructure needed to address the complex interplay of these conditions and their therapies. We have designed a novel blended, culturally congruent, evidence-informed care model, “Healing our Hearts, Minds and Bodies” (HHMB), to address patients' trauma histories and barriers to care, and to prepare patients to engage in CVD risk reduction. Recognizing the need to ensure that PLWHIV receive CVD guideline- concordant care, we have also identified implementation strategies to prepare providers and clinics for addressing CVD risk among their HIV-positive patients. Therefore, using a hybrid type II effectiveness/implementation study design, the goal of this study is to increase both patient and organizational readiness to address trauma and CVD risk among PLWHIV. The Specific Aims are: (1) to assess and enhance organizational readiness for addressing trauma and CVD risk among ethnic minority PLWHIV; specifically, a phased approach will drive the use of implementation strategies designed to educate, monitor, and support providers and staff in adhering to CVD care guidelines; (2) using mixed methods, to (a) evaluate the use and effectiveness of implementation strategies over time, and (b) identify barriers and facilitators to organizational adoption of guidelines, provider adherence to guidelines, feasibility, and sustainability; and (3) to evaluate the effect of HHMB on cognitive-behavioral, emotional, and physical outcomes among 260 PLWHIV, specifically patient activation, engagement in care, knowledge of CVD risk, adherence to clinicians' recommendations, cardiovascular health, mental health symptoms, and satisfaction with care. We will use the RE-AIM framework to guide the evaluation and the Replicating Effective Programs (REP) Framework to guide the use of implementation strategies and the tailoring of the care model within our participating implementation settings. Project Narrative: Now that HIV is considered a manageable chronic disease, multi-morbidity conditions have increasingly become a focus for research and clinical attention. Yet, there is a paucity of culturally congruent interventions designed to address the intersections of health related issues and tailored to those that are disproportionately affected by the HIV — i.e., people of color. This study examines the development and implementation of a culturally congruent narrative film; it is designed as an enhancement to curricula integrating care across HIV and chronic conditions specifically focusing on HIV, Cardiovascular disease (CVD), and trauma.","The Development and Implementation of a Culturally-Congruent Educational Film designed for PLWHIV to Address Patients' Trauma Histories, Barriers to Care, and CVD Risk Reduction",10019763,U01HL142109,"['Adoption ', ' Affect ', ' Anxiety ', ' Attention ', ' Award ', ' Behavior ', ' California ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Client ', ' Color ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Computers ', ' Confounding Factors (Epidemiology) ', ' Confounding Variables ', ' Epidemiologic Confounding Factor ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Data Collection ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Environment ', ' Focus Groups ', ' Future ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Heart ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' HIV ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' HIV Infections ', ' HTLV-III Infections ', ' HTLV-III-LAV Infections ', ' Human T-Lymphotropic Virus Type III Infections ', ' HIV Seropositivity ', ' Anti-HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Positive ', ' HIV Positivity ', ' HIV Seroconversion ', ' HIV antibody positive ', ' HTLV-III Seroconversion ', ' HTLV-III Seropositivity ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hybrids ', ' Institutes ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Neurosciences ', ' Parents ', ' Patients ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Questionnaires ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Recommendation ', ' Research ', ' Research Design ', ' Study Type ', ' study design ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Telephone ', ' Phone ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Use Effectiveness ', ' Writing ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Emotional Depression ', ' depression symptom ', ' depressive ', ' depressive symptoms ', ' Film ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Caring ', ' Guidelines ', ' base ', ' dosage ', ' Site ', ' Chronic ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Failure ', ' satisfaction ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Complex ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Emotional ', ' Modeling ', ' Sampling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Provider ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Symptoms ', ' Adherence ', ' Effectiveness of Interventions ', ' Cognitive ', ' Monitor ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' active followup ', ' follow up ', ' followed up ', ' followup ', ' follow-up ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' post intervention ', ' healing ', ' Post-traumatic growth ', ' Posttraumatic growth ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Mind ', ' Quasi-experiment ', ' Trauma ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' emotional regulation ', ' emotion regulation ', ' intervention design ', ' treatment design ', ' therapy design ', ' parent grant ', ' treatment adherence ', ' efficacy testing ', ' compare efficacy ', ' comparative efficacy ', ' multimorbidity ', ' multiple chronic conditions ', ' Trauma patient ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' retention strategy ', ' student retention ', ' retention rate ', ' recruit ', ' barrier to health care ', ' barrier to healthcare ', ' barrier to treatment ', ' obstacle to care ', ' obstacle to healthcare ', ' barrier to care ', ' implementation strategy ', ' Infrastructure ', ' post-traumatic stress symptoms ', ' posttraumatic stress symptoms ', ' posttraumatic symptoms ', ' post-traumatic symptoms ', ' compare intervention ', ' comparison intervention ', ' effectiveness implementation hybrid ', ' effectiveness implementation study ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA LOS ANGELES,U01,2020,21626,0.20908147104266264
"Heart of the Family: A Cardiovascular Disease and Type 2 Diabetes Risk Reduction Intervention in High-Risk Rural Families ABSTRACT Rural populations in the U.S. have disproportionately higher prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) compared to urban populations. Many rural communities also have greater risk factor burden than urban communities including unhealthier diet, higher rates of physical inactivity, obesity, and smoking, and higher prevalence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperglycemia. Compounding these are poor socioeconomic conditions and limited health resources. Hispanic residents of rural communities may experience worse CVD and T2D disease and risk burden than non-Hispanic residents due to higher rates of poverty, lower educational attainment, and greater barriers accessing resources. U.S. Hispanics have among the highest rates of T2D of any racial or ethnic group. Culturally responsive lifestyle modification interventions are needed to reduce T2D and CVD risk in rural Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. Modification strategies commonly target individuals and, while these may result in behavior change immediate post-intervention, sustained engagement in healthy behaviors is seldom achieved. Family engagement in lifestyle interventions may support sustained engagement in healthy behaviors especially in rural and Hispanic populations that often have greater reliance on family members for social support. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effects of a dyadic intervention, Heart of the Family, to an active control intervention. We will compare 3-month (short-term) and 12-month (long-term) impact of the Heart of the Family intervention on biological and behavioral T2D and CVD risk factors and evaluate whether ethnicity moderates intervention effects. We will also examine how each active intervention dyad member’s engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors and level of support for their partner’s engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors affects their own and their partner’s outcomes. A family focused intervention may better support long-term engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to reduce T2D and CVD risk among at-risk rural Hispanics and non-Hispanics. Further, this community-based intervention has significant potential for broad implementation to successfully address T2D and CVD health disparities across U.S. Hispanic communities. NARRATIVE Rural populations in the U.S. are disproportionately burdened by cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle modification interventions are needed that support long-term engagement in risk-reducing health behaviors. Our proposal will study the effects of a family focused, lifestyle intervention that is culturally tailored for use with rural Hispanic and non-Hispanic adults and will have significant potential for

"20th Anniversary Conference: Every Heartbeat Matters: Changing the Future of Heart Health Contact PD/PI: Sims, Mario PROJECT SUMMARY Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death in the US, and African Americans (AAs) experience a disproportionate burden of CVD. The Jackson Heart Study (JHS) is a community-based, cohort study of CVD and related risk factors (biological, behavioral, and social determinants) among AAs in Jackson, MS, that serves as a rich resource to the scientific community for novel research on the etiology of CVD among AAs. We propose a 2-day 20th Anniversary JHS Conference to accomplish the following aims that incorporate major themes of the NHLBI mission and its 2020 Strategic Vision including: Aim 1. Advance scientific knowledge of CVD disparities among AAs through the following activities: (a) present 20 years of scientific findings on cardiovascular (CV) health among AAs and (b) stimulate novel research methods for future scientific studies. Aim 2. Promote workforce diversity by focusing on training and mentoring through the following activities: (a) Identification of strategies to build successful mentorship and traineeship of underrepresented minorities, and (b) Provide Early Stage Investigators with mentorship opportunities for developing and submitting high-quality manuscripts. Aim 3. Advance translation and dissemination of findings through the following activities: (a) Review of the process for translating and disseminating research findings into the community, and (b) Overview of methods for translating research findings into novel health promotion messages. Our Conference is highly significant because it involves a collaboration between a major medical research center (UMMC), two historically black colleges and universities (Tougaloo College and Jackson State University) and a state health department (Mississippi State Department of Health) that uses a multi-level approach to address CVD disparities in a state with a high burden of CVD among AAs. Contact PD/PI: Sims, Mario PROJECT NARRATIVE Despite declines in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, CVD remains the leading cause of death in the US, and African Americans (AAs) in the southeastern US continue to experience a disproportionate burden of CVD. The JHS has contributed to the scientific understanding of this burden over the last twenty years. We propose a two-day conference (“Jackson Heart Study 20th Anniversary Conference: Every Heartbeat Matters – Changing the Future of Heart Health”) that will accomplish the following: (1) advance scientific knowledge of CVD findings among AAs; (2) promote workforce diversity through training underrepresented minorities CVD epidemiology; and (3) translate research into health promotion tools in the community.",20th Anniversary Conference: Every Heartbeat Matters: Changing the Future of Heart Health,10069914,R13HL154550,"['Anniversary ', ' Awareness ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cause of Death ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' promoting health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' Mission ', ' Mississippi ', ' mortality ', ' Publishing ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Talents ', ' Traineeship ', ' Training Activity ', ' training module ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Woman ', ' Writing ', ' Medical Research ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' base ', ' Clinical ', ' Biological ', ' Training ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' collegiate ', ' college ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' cardiovascular disease epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular epidemiology ', ' cardiovascular disorder epidemiology ', ' experience ', ' Manuscripts ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Pathogenesis ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Future Generations ', ' Causality ', ' causation ', ' disease causation ', ' Etiology ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' scientific accomplishments ', ' scientific advances ', ' Scientific Advances and Accomplishments ', ' investigator training ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Update ', ' Monitor ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' work group ', ' working group ', ' NHLBI ', ' National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Jackson Heart Study ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' Heart health ', ' Cardiac health ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIVERSITY OF MISSISSIPPI MED CTR,R13,2020,15560,0.12488196640506961
"Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI Persons with serious mental illness (SMI) comprise one of the most highly vulnerable groups in the US, dying 10 to 20 years earlier and with mortality rates two to over three times higher than the overall population. Much of this premature death is attributable to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is potentially preventable; all CVD risk behaviors (unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco smoking) and risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia) are markedly elevated in persons with SMI. Concomitantly, persons with SMI often receive poor quality of care for these conditions. While these health and mortality gaps are widely recognized as a public health crisis, individual, provider, organizational, and policy level barriers impede progress. While many persons with SMI receive most of their care from the public mental health sector, tailored interventions to decrease CVD risk shown effective in clinical trials for those with SMI (e.g., for weight loss, smoking cessation) have not been widely adopted in community mental health settings. Meaningfully advancing health and decreasing mortality disparities for persons with SMI requires urgent development and testing of implementation strategies for scale-up of practical, effective interventions.  In response to this extraordinary burden of years of life lost, our goal is to create the Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI that will use cutting-edge transdisciplinary methods towards short and long-term progress to reduce CVD risk in this highly vulnerable population. The Center’s uniquely qualified team will conduct 3 R34 studies to develop and pilot test innovative implementation strategies to address all CVD risk behaviors and risk factors in persons with SMI in community mental health settings. The R34s will focus on evidence-based approaches for: 1) behavioral weight loss with diet and physical activity; 2) tobacco smoking cessation treatment; 3) care delivery for diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. The Methods Core will use a transdisciplinary approach incorporating clinical and behavioral intervention research, implementation science, human factors engineering, systems science, and health services research to support Center research. The Methods Core will also advance research methods in 1) human factors engineering to support implementation; 2) avatar-assisted training and assessment in motivational interviewing; 3) quantitative methods to support intervention scale-up; 4) and systems science. The Administrative Core will engage stakeholders, building on well-established partnerships in Maryland and nationally, and bring together all of the Center’s activities. The gaping differential in life expectancy and CVD risk factor burden in persons with SMI calls for concentrated, transdisciplinary approaches to solutions. This Center will create a nexus of innovation and momentum around T2 translation to reduce premature mortality in SMI. Our vision is health equity – that persons with SMI, similar to persons without SMI, live long healthy lives. Persons with serious mental illness (SMI) are one of the most highly vulnerable groups in the US, dying 10 to 20 years earlier than the overall population, primarily due to cardiovascular disease. The proposed Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI will develop and test innovative strategies for scaling-up effective interventions to address cardiovascular risk behaviors (unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco smoking) and risk factors (obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia) among consumers with SMI. If interventions shown to be effective in clinical trials can be implemented on a large scale, we can ultimately save thousands of live each year; our vision is health equity – that persons with SMI, similar to persons without SMI, live long healthy lives.",Center to Accelerate Translation of Interventions to Decrease Premature Mortality in SMI,9964916,P50MH115842,"['Adoption ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Behavioral Research ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' comorbidity ', ' co-morbid ', ' co-morbidity ', ' Consultations ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Diet ', ' dietary ', ' Engineering ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Health Services Research ', ' Health Services Evaluation ', ' Medical Care Research ', ' services research ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Hypertension ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disease ', ' Vascular Hypertensive Disorder ', ' high blood pressure ', ' hyperpiesia ', ' hyperpiesis ', ' hypertensive disease ', ' Intervention Studies ', ' intervention research ', ' interventional research ', ' interventional study ', ' interventions research ', ' Life Expectancy ', ' Maryland ', ' Mental Health ', ' Mental Hygiene ', ' Psychological Health ', ' Mentorship ', ' Methods ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' Obesity ', ' adiposity ', ' corpulence ', ' corpulency ', ' corpulentia ', ' obese ', ' obese people ', ' obese person ', ' obese population ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' medical specialties ', ' Specialty ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Translations ', ' Vision ', ' Sight ', ' visual function ', ' Body Weight decreased ', ' Weight Loss ', ' Weight Reduction ', ' body weight loss ', ' wt-loss ', ' Organizational Policy ', ' smoking cessation ', ' cease smoking ', ' quit smoking ', ' stop smoking ', ' Criminal Justice ', ' Family member ', ' Research Methods ', ' Research Methodology ', ' Risky Behavior ', ' at risk behavior ', ' Risk Behaviors ', ' Advocacy ', ' Caring ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' prematurity ', ' premature ', ' Medical ', ' Communicating Junction ', ' Low-resistance Junction ', ' Nexus ', ' Nexus Junction ', ' Gap Junctions ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Discipline ', ' homeless ', ' unhoused ', ' Homelessness ', ' Individual ', ' Policy Maker ', ' Dyslipidemias ', ' Premature Mortality ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Adopted ', ' System ', ' Tobacco smoking ', ' Tobacco smoking behavior ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' health care organization ', ' healthcare organization ', ' healthcare service organization ', ' health care service organization ', ' care delivery ', ' synergism ', ' cohort ', ' Speed ', ' peer ', ' Communication Methods ', ' research study ', ' motivational interview ', ' motivational enhancement therapy ', ' social ', ' cardiovascular risk ', ' cardiovascular risk factor ', ' QOC ', ' Quality of Care ', ' response ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Provider ', ' smoking cessation treatment ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Health Communication ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' years of life lost ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' chronic mental illness ', ' persistent mental illness ', ' serious mental disorder ', ' serious mental illness ', ' severe mental disorder ', ' severe mental illness ', ' scale up ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' Health behavior change ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' implementation science ', ' research into practice ', ' research to practice ', ' effective intervention ', ' evidence base ', ' health equity ', ' lack of physical activity ', ' physical inactivity ', ' disparities in mortality ', ' mortality disparity ', ' system-level barriers ', ' implementation strategy ', ' Unhealthy Diet ', ' ']",NIMH,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,P50,2020,1553840,0.045036871916537324
"SURPASS: (Statin Use and Risk Prediction of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease in minority Subgroups) PROJECT SUMMARY Despite advances in technology, cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death, disability, and healthcare costs in the U.S. Yet, there is a tremendous gap in accurate cardiovascular risk prediction and prevention, particularly in racial/ethnic minorities. Furthermore, there is significant heterogeneity in CVD risks and outcomes for disaggregated Hispanic and Asian subgroups. The current cardiovascular risk assessment tools have not been well-validated in these diverse populations, and it remains largely unknown why minority patients are less likely to start and more likely to stop life-saving therapies. The overall goal of Dr. Rodriguez’s K01 application is to address gaps in knowledge about CVD prediction and treatment in understudied racial/ethnic minority populations. The proposed study will utilize the electronic health record (EHR) data from an established NHLBI-funded cohort enriched with disaggregated Hispanic and Asian patients. Using this cohort, Dr. Rodriguez will first test the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations in disaggregated Asian and Hispanic subgroups using a large diverse mixed-payer cohort of 1,234,751 patients from two large healthcare systems in Northern California and Hawaii. Secondly, she will build new CVD risk prediction models for diverse patient subgroups using machine learning techniques. Finally, she will identify reasons for statin underuse and discontinuation using natural language processing in the EHR. This study, which will evaluate existing data from real-world clinical practice in a stable population, will inform future risk prediction models and cholesterol treatment guidelines for diverse racial/ethnic groups. The proposal is aligned with the NHBLI’s strategic goals to eliminate health disparities and inequities by leveraging epidemiology and data science to understand and solve complex health problems. This proposal will also prepare Dr. Rodriguez to meet her long-term goal of becoming a national leader and independent investigator in CVD prevention and minority health. The proposed didactic and applied data science experiences, including training in advanced epidemiological methods and machine learning, will prepare Dr. Rodriguez to apply her research to other areas of CVD prevention and populations. This training program builds on the strengths of Stanford University in health services research, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Her mentorship team, led by Dr. Latha Palaniappan, includes experts in cardiovascular prevention and health services research (Dr. Heidenreich, co-mentor), applied statistical analyses (Dr. Robert Tibshirani, advisor), machine learning in the EHR (Dr. Nigam Shah, advisor), and chronic disease prediction and medical decision making (Dr. Michael Pignone, advisor). Dr. Rodriguez’s team is committed to ensuring the success of the proposal as well as overseeing her advanced training in their respective areas of expertise. The research and training plan proposed in this K01 application will develop Dr. Rodriguez into a unique and highly-skilled clinician researcher ready to compete for R-level funding and launch her independent research career. ! PROJECT NARRATIVE Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death for racial/ethnic minority groups in the U.S., yet current CVD risk prediction algorithms fail to adequately assess risk in these populations. The proposal will address this substantial knowledge gap by validating current risk prediction models in racial/ethnic minority subgroups, improving risk prediction using modern machine learning techniques, and identifying reasons for statin discontinuation. Findings from this study will provide the foundation for clinical guidelines, research agendas, and public health interventions to improve CVD prevention strategies in diverse populations. !",SURPASS:

"The role of epigenetic transcriptional memory in monocyte-macrophage cells and cardiovascular disease risk Project Summary/Abstract This proposal details a five-year training program to support the candidate to achieve his long-term career goal of building a successful independent transdisciplinary research program featuring clinical, immunology, and epigenetic research to address the impact of epigenetic transcriptional memory in immune cells on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in minority populations. The candidate has a strong scientific skillset and knowledge in epigenetics that provides a solid background to ensure his success in pursuing transdisciplinary clinical research focused on CVD. The candidate seeks to focus his career development and enhance his experience and technical research skills in immunology and clinical CVD research. The candidate will acquire essential research skills including flow cytometry, in vitro and ex-vivo monocyte/macrophage functional assays of human cells, and integrative bioinformatics to establish his independence in using his expertise in epigenetics to address CVD. He has already established his own independent research project aimed at defining the role of epigenetic regulation of monocyte/macrophage cellular responses across ethnicities with CVD health disparities. The scientific and institutional environment at the University of Hawaii is well-matched to ensuring the candidate achieves his career goals to study the immune system and CVD. There are multiple independently funded research programs such as the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Research, COBRE Diabetes Center, and Research Multidisciplinary and Translational Research Infrastructure Expansion project that will provide shared resources and core facilities and offer numerous collaborative opportunities in cardiometabolic disease research. A key component of the research career development plan is mentorship from a multi-disciplinary mentoring team focused on cardiovascular disease research consisting of immunology, clinical, and health disparity research experts committed toward contributing their expertise to support the candidate’s career development and expand his research training. The candidate will pursue a hypothesis that dysfunctional monocyte responses associated with high cardiovascular disease risk are related to epigenomic programming differences at inflammatory and metabolic genes and are exacerbated in Native Hawaiians compared to Caucasians. To test this hypothesis, a cross-sectional study of viably cryopreserved blood specimens from 200 Native Hawaiians and age gender research project aimed at addressing the matched Caucasians with clinically defined high and low CVD risk. The specific aims are (1) To measure and compare functional responses of isolated monocyte and macrophage cells from NHOPI and Caucasians with clinically defined low or high CVD risk in the Multiethnic cohort. (2) Determine if epigenetically regulated inflammatory and metabolic genes in isolated monocyte cells from NHOPI and Caucasians associate with CVD risk and differ by ethnicity. (3) Within monocytes from high CVD risk NHOPI and Caucasians, to examine the impact of metformin on the epigenetic state of inflammatory and metabolic genes. Project Narrative Cardiovascular disease disproportionately affects ethnic/racial minorities. Epigenetic studies of immune cells from clinically-defined multiethnic cohorts may reveal new molecular signatures of CVD risk.

"Polygenic Risk Scores for Diverse Populations - Bridging Research and Clinical Care Abstract Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors impose major societal burdens and are leading causes of morbidity, mortality, and disability. Precision medicine is uniquely positioned to address CVD and its risk factors, enabled by decades of investigation and billions of dollars of investment that have established their strong underlying genetic basis. Polygenic risk scores (PRS), the aggregation of risk variants into a single score, provides one such example. Research on PRS in CVD has transitioned from estimation to examining the clinical utility; i.e., determining when and how PRS adoption will occur and how similarly conceived environmental/lifestyle risk scores (ERS) can be used clinically in concert with PRS. However, the majority of participants included in large-scale CVD research have been of European ancestry (EA), limiting the global translation of genetic associations into clinical and public health applications relevant for all populations. The PAGE consortium and others have demonstrated that EA-derived PRS are not directly translatable to racially/ethnically diverse populations. Statistical tools for PRS estimation and interpretation are founded on strong assumptions that are violated, and create bias, in the context of population structure that characterizes racially/ethnically diverse populations. These research gaps will exacerbate long-standing racial/ethnic disparities in CVD and its risk factors, underscoring the need for research that enables all groups to reap the benefits of PRS-enabled personalized prevention. In this revised application, we address the limitations previously identified in our original application by leveraging high-quality, harmonized, and centrally available data from a network of cohorts and biobanks with linked electronic health records, capturing CVD and its risk factors. Through this effort, we will include over 1.5M non- European ancestry participants to develop and validate PRS for CVD-associated traits in racially/ethnically diverse populations. We will create the methods, resources, and best practices for the clinical and public health communities. This research will permit adoption and application of PRS for the detection, intervention, and treatment of CVD risk factors. Our ultimate goal is to reduce and prevent the burden of CVD in all populations. Our Specific Aims are (1) Creation of unbiased PRS: Develop and evaluate CVD PRS in combination with ERS in the large and racially/ethnically diverse PAGE study; and (2) Validation, calibration and dissemination: Externally validate and improve upon risk score models in biobanks and translate risk score models for improved access and understanding for the medical community. We will build the next generation of methods, resources, and best-practices to empower appropriate development of PRS and subsequent prediction and clinical interrogation in CVD. Deliberate focus on non-EA populations will ensure that they are not the last to benefit in the new era of genomic medicine. Narrative In this application, we address major limitations in the science of polygenic risk scores (PRS) by leveraging high- quality, harmonized, and centrally available data from the multi-ethnic PAGE study with extension to a network of biobanks with linked electronic health records (EHR), thereby capturing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors to demonstrate the utility of PRS for CVD in racially/ethnically diverse populations.",Polygenic Risk Scores for Diverse Populations - Bridging Research and Clinical Care,10071409,R01HL151152,"['Adoption ', ' Architecture ', ' Engineering / Architecture ', ' Calibration ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cohort Studies ', ' Concurrent Studies ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiologic ', ' epidemiological ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Genetic Techniques ', ' Genetic Technics ', ' Population Genetics ', ' Genotype ', ' Goals ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Investments ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Phenotype ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Science ', ' Translating ', ' Genetic Translation ', ' mRNA Translation ', ' Weight ', ' World Health ', ' Asians ', ' oriental ', ' Measures ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' disability ', ' European ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' tool ', ' Investigation ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' CVD prevention ', ' cardiac disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disease prevention ', ' cardiovascular disorder prevention ', ' Performance ', ' cohort ', ' trait ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' outreach ', ' Document Type ', ' Report (document) ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' epidemiology study ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' Genomics ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' genetic association ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Detection ', ' Improve Access ', ' Public Health Applications ', ' Public Health Applications Research ', ' Validation ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' electronic health care record ', ' electronic healthcare record ', ' Electronic Health Record ', ' next generation ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' clinical relevance ', ' clinically relevant ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' racial and ethnic disparities ', ' clinical care ', ' nongenetic ', ' non-genetic ', ' clinical practice ', ' biorepository ', ' biobank ', ' Risk-associated variant ', ' risk allele ', ' risk gene ', ' risk genotype ', ' risk loci ', ' risk locus ', ' risk variant ', ' precision-based medicine ', ' precision medicine ', ' personalized prevention ', ' precision prevention ', ' individualized prevention ', ' internet portal ', ' on-line portal ', ' online portal ', ' web-based portal ', ' web portal ', ' Genomic medicine ', ' phenotypic data ', ' genomic epidemiology ', ' secondary analysis ', ' harmonized data ', ' data harmonization ', ' polygenic risk score ', ' ']",NHLBI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,R01,2020,2404260,0.21436609868751605
"Cardiovascular Health of Sexual and Gender Minorities in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SGM HCHS/SOL) Project Summary/Abstract Hispanic/Latino sexual and gender minorities (SGM) are the fastest growing ethnic group of SGM in the U.S. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among Hispanic/Latinos. SGM inequities in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk have been identified as early as young adulthood; and minority stress has been identified as a potential moderator. Yet, small numbers of ethnic minority participants in SGM studies have precluded examination of the intersections of sexual orientation, gender identity, and ethnicity. We propose a cost-effective ancillary study that will leverage existing data from the parent Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (HCHS/SOL) while collecting new data on sexual orientation, gender identity, stigma, discrimination, stress, coping, social support, and CVD risk. The proposed study is timely because HCHS/SOL participants will be scheduled for their third in-person visits (V3) starting in November 2019. In this study, we will (1) examine the influence of sexual orientation and gender identity on CVD risk among all HCHS/SOL participants at V3 (~9300); (2) model pathways from sexual orientation and gender identity to CVD risk through stigma, discrimination, and stress among a 1:2 matched sub-cohort of SGM and non-SGM participants at V3 (~1680); and (3) examine the influence of stigma/discrimination on sexual orientation and CVD risk relationships among sub-cohort participants at V3. Data analysis will follow a conceptual model derived from the LGBT Minority Stress Model in which excess stigma discrimination against SGM leads to minority stress that increases CVD risk. In this model, coping and social support serve as resilience factors that mitigate the impact of minority stress on CVD risk. Cross-sectional and longitudinal regression models as well as structural equation models will be used to test these relationships. Understanding the influence of stigma-induced stress on CVD risk among Hispanic/Latino SGM has significant implications for the development of culturally-specific CVD risk reduction strategies. Study findings will be used to build on identified Hispanic/Latino cultural strengths to inform adaptation and testing of family and community acceptance interventions. . Project Narrative/Public Health Relevance The cardiovascular health of Hispanic/Latino sexual and gender minorities has been understudied. The goal of this study is to examine relationships between sexual/gender minority stress, coping, social support, and heart disease - a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among Hispanic/Latinos in the U.S. Findings will inform development of culturally-appropriate interventions to address psychosocial factors that may contribute to cardiovascular health disparities by sexual orientation and gender identity.",Cardiovascular Health of Sexual and Gender Minorities in the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos (SGM HCHS/SOL),9863147,R01HL149778,"['Acculturation ', ' Cultural Assimilation ', ' Adult ', ' 21+ years old ', ' Adult Human ', ' adulthood ', ' Age ', ' ages ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Chicago ', ' Communities ', ' Data Analyses ', ' Data Analysis ', ' data interpretation ', ' Discrimination ', ' Cognitive Discrimination ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Face ', ' faces ', ' facial ', ' Family ', ' Gender Identity ', ' Goals ', ' Health ', ' Heart Diseases ', ' Cardiac Diseases ', ' Cardiac Disorders ', ' heart disorder ', ' Linear Regressions ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Persons ', ' New York ', ' Parents ', ' Personal Satisfaction ', ' well-being ', ' wellbeing ', ' Psychometrics ', ' Psychosocial Factor ', ' psychosocial variables ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' Research Support ', ' Residencies ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Social Identification ', ' Social Identity ', ' Social support ', ' social support network ', ' Stigmatization ', ' Stress ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Gender ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Latino Population ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' hispanic community ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Schedule ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' analytical method ', ' Site ', ' Sexual Orientation ', ' Sex Orientation ', ' adult youth ', ' young adulthood ', ' young adult ', ' Ethnicity ', ' Ethnic Origin ', ' Immigrant ', ' Attenuated ', ' instrument ', ' Knowledge ', ' Scientist ', ' Country ', ' Visit ', ' Equation ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Structure ', ' Participant ', ' social ', ' Modeling ', ' stigma ', ' social stigma ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Length ', ' Data ', ' High Prevalence ', ' Stress and Coping ', ' Ancillary Study ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Epidemiologist ', ' Funding Opportunities ', ' sex ', ' Modification ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' Minority ', ' resilience ', ' cost effective ', ' coping ', ' Population ', ' Psychosocial Stress ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' eligible participant ', ' public health relevance ', ' effective intervention ', ' sexual minority ', ' LGBT ', ' Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender ', ' Gender and Sexual Minorities ', ' Sexual and Gender Minorities ', ' gender minority ', ' cardiovascular health ', ' HCHS/SOL Study ', ' HCHS/SOL cohort ', ' Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos ', ' intersectionalities ', ' intersectionality ', ' Long-term cohort study ', ' Longterm cohort study ', ' Longitudinal cohort study ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NHLBI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R01,2020,818668,0.10712468806176702
"Estrogen-Mediated Impairments of Vascular Health in Diabetes Diabetes has recently been referred to as “the epidemic of the 21st century” and contributes to a substantial economic burden on the United States public health. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 80% of morbidity and mortality in diabetes, however, women with type 1 diabetes have a substantially greater risk for CVD compared to men with diabetes. A critical barrier to understanding this sexual dimorphism in CVD risk is the lack of knowledge regarding the role of estrogen (E2) on vascular health in diabetic women. Oxidative stress is a common phenotype in patients with diabetes and is routinley associated with hyperglycemia and diabetic complications. In addition, sirtuin1 (Sirt1) has been proposed to play a fundemental role in regulating nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, and is lower in patients with diabetes. Accordingly, our central hypothesis is that an elevated concentration of E2 in women with type 1 diabetes contributes to a reduction in NO- bioavailability and vascular health through two separate pathways; an increase in oxidative stress and a decrease in circulating Sirt1. In support, compelling preliminary data indicate that the natural increase in vascular health from menses to the late follicular phase of the menstrual cycle is lost in the presence of type 1 diabetes. In addition, this loss is associated with increased oxidative stress and lower Sirt1. To investigate the impact of E2 on vascular health in women with diabetes, we propose to utilize the menstrual cycle as a natural and novel method to investigate changes in sex-steroid hormones. We will perform a comprehensive assessment of vascular health in men and at two different times during the menstrual cycle in premenopausal women with and without type 1 diabetes: 1) during the menses (low estrogen/low progesterone) and 2) late follicular (elevated estrogen/low progesterone) phases. In addition, we will employ two novel treatments that may mitigate future CVD risk in patients with diabetes. Findings will not only contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with sex disparities of CVD risk in diabetes, they may identify novel therapeutic approaches to decrease estrogen-mediated vascular dysfunction in women with diabetes. This proposal demonstrates the true model of translational research and represents a major shift in the approach to understanding the sexual dimorphism of CVD risk in patients with type 1 diabetes. Diabetes has recently been referred to as “the epidemic of the 21st century”. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for 80% of diabetes-associated morbidity and mortality and women with type 1 diabetes suffer substantially more risk for CVD compared to men with diabetes. However, the reason for this sex-disparity in CVD risk is unknown. Findings from this proposal will not only uncover circulating levels of estrogen throughout the menstrual cycle as a contributor of poor vascular health, it will identify 2 potential therapeutic treatment options to improve blood vessel function in patients with type 1 diabetes.",Estrogen-Mediated Impairments of Vascular Health in Diabetes,9843557,R01HL137087,"['Aftercare ', ' After Care ', ' After-Treatment ', ' post treatment ', ' Antioxidants ', ' anti-oxidant ', ' Ascorbic Acid ', ' VIT C ', ' Vitamin C ', ' Biological Availability ', ' Bioavailability ', ' Biologic Availability ', ' Physiologic Availability ', ' Blood Vessels ', ' vascular ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Diabetes Mellitus ', ' diabetes ', ' Experimental Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Experimental Diabetes ', ' Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Brittle Diabetes Mellitus ', ' IDDM ', ' Juvenile-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Ketosis-Prone Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Sudden-Onset Diabetes Mellitus ', ' T1 DM ', ' T1 diabetes ', ' T1D ', ' T1DM ', ' Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus ', ' Type 1 diabetes ', ' Type I Diabetes Mellitus ', ' insulin dependent diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes ', ' juvenile diabetes mellitus ', ' ketosis prone diabetes ', ' type I diabetes ', ' type one diabetes ', ' Double-Blind Method ', ' Double-Blind Study ', ' Double-Blinded ', ' Double-Masked Method ', ' Double-Masked Study ', ' Endothelium ', ' Epidemic ', ' Estrogens ', ' Therapeutic Estrogen ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' proliferative phase Menstrual cycle ', ' Follicular Phase ', ' Follicular Phase Menstrual Cycle ', ' Menstrual Proliferative Phase ', ' Preovulatory Phase ', ' Future ', ' Health ', ' Hyperglycemia ', ' hyperglycemic ', ' indexing ', ' Iontophoresis ', ' Drug Iontophoresis ', ' iontophoresis therapy ', ' Lasers ', ' Laser Electromagnetic ', ' Laser Radiation ', ' Thioctic Acid ', ' 1,2-Dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid ', ' Lipoic Acid ', ' alpha-Lipoic Acid ', ' men ', "" men's "", ' Menstrual cycle ', ' Menstruation ', ' Menses ', ' menstrual period ', ' monthly period ', ' Methods ', ' Morbidity -

"Corazón de la Familia (Heart of the Family) ABSTRACT Hispanics have significantly higher rates of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk burden compared to non-Hispanic whites. Dramatic increases in rates of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in U.S. Hispanics are anticipated as the population ages and acculturation lends to engagement in unhealthy behaviors. Culturally appropriate lifestyle modification strategies are needed for effective risk reduction. Most lifestyle modification strategies have focused on individuals and sustained engagement in healthy behaviors is seldom achieved. Respectful of the Hispanic cultural value of familismo, prioritizing of the well-being of the family over that of the individual, we propose to conduct a family dyad-focused intervention that addresses family members as active participants in a lifestyle intervention for Hispanics with high risk for T2D or CVD. “Corazón de la Familia” (“Heart of the Family”) is a promotores’- (community health workers’) facilitated intervention that integrates evidence-based education and health behavior skills development with social support strategies through the involvement of family members. We will conduct a randomized controlled trial using a 2-group design and compare the short-term and long-term impact of the family dyad-focused active intervention to an individual-focused control condition on biological and behavioral T2D and CVD risk factors. Furthermore, we will determine how each active intervention dyad member’s engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors and level of support for their partner’s engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors affects their own and their partner’s outcomes. Guided by community-based participatory research principles, our community-academic partnership was formed in response to needs recognized by Hispanic residents of Kentucky for socioculturally tailored health promotion programs to reduce T2D and CVD risk. Hispanic community partners have been integrally involved in all phases of sociocultural tailoring and pilot testing the Corazón de la Familia intervention. The result of the work of our community-academic partnership is a family dyad-focused intervention that provides a unique approach to sustain engagement in healthy lifestyle behaviors to reduce T2D and CVD risk among at-risk Hispanics. Further, this community-based intervention has significant potential for broad implementation to successfully address T2D and CVD health disparities across U.S. Hispanic communities. PROJECT NARRATIVE Using a community-based participatory research approach, this is a community-academic partnership initiative to reduce type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk in Hispanic community members with high risk for these diseases. The promotores (community health workers) facilitated intervention engages family dyads to support healthy lifestyle behaviors among dyad members, integrating skills-based risk reduction approaches with social support strategies.

"Particulate Matter (PM) Metals and Racial Disparity in Cardiovascular (CVD) Risk Factors Summary/Abstract Given the complex composition of pollutants such as particulate matter PM in the environment, it is believed that our exposure is not limited to one chemical at a time but to several possible mixtures with varying composition and mix ratios. These mixtures could be formed because they are emitted at the same time from the same source origin as latent factors. As a result, humans are more susceptible to exposure to these mixtures as characterized by these latent factors. Factor analysis is one tool used in the literature to define mixtures. Unfortunately statistical methods of identifying mixtures are limited. Additionally, exposure to PM chemicals during pregnancy is known to be harmful to both mother and child. To address the problem a new method of identifying mixtures exposure based on extension of the traditional factor analysis combined with source apportionment methods will be used. This proposal will test the following hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: Exposure to PM mixture metals during pregnancy increased the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors among black and Hispanic minorities and vary by trimester. Hypothesis 2: CVD risk factors are mediators between PM metals exposure and child development, through the following Aims. 1) Quantify mixtures and estimate mother's exposure during various trimesters of pregnancy. We will use the newly developed Bayesian extended factor analysis (FA), based on the flexibility of Bayesian statistics and the decomposition of the error covariance matrix combined with SAM models to estimate metal mixtures. We will perform a spatio-temporal analysis of the mixtures using Generalized Additive Mixed Models(GAMM). We will use the inverse distance weighting method to estimate mother's inhaled quantities during each trimester of pregnancy. 2) Investigate CVD risk factors difference among black and white and interaction between air pollution and race/ethnicity by trimester. We will use logistic regression analysis and generalized spatial linear model for this aim. 3) Investigate CVD risk factors moderating between mixture metals exposure and infant mortality. We will use structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate wich risk factors is in the pathway between exposure and child mortality. Results from the proposed studies could have implications in identifying mixtures exposures, their chemical toxicity and relative implication in CVD during pregnancy. Project Narrative Exposure to Particulate Matter (PM) metals during pregnancy is known to be harmful to both mother and the new born. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is one such harmful effect of exposure to PM metals. In the natural environment we are always exposed to mixtures of chemicals with different toxicities. Unfortunately, methods of identifying those mixtures are limited. In this K01 application, we are proposing a novel method of pollutant mixtures identification and we will investigate their association with CVD risk factors.",Particulate Matter (PM) Metals and Racial Disparity in Cardiovascular (CVD) Risk Factors,9892567,K01HL146944,"['Air ', ' Air Pollutants ', ' Air Pollution ', ' Aluminum ', ' Al element ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Cadmium ', ' Cd element ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Cardiovascular system ', ' Cardiovascular ', ' Cardiovascular Body System ', ' Cardiovascular Organ System ', ' Heart Vascular ', ' circulatory system ', ' Child ', ' 0-11 years old ', ' Child Youth ', ' Children (0-21) ', ' children ', "" childrens' "", ' youngster ', ' Child Development ', ' Infant and Child Development ', ' Child Mortality ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Embryology ', ' Environment ', ' Fetal Development ', ' Developing fetus ', ' Fetus ', ' Florida ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Growth and Development function ', ' Growth and Development ', ' Health ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Infant Mortality ', ' Infant Mortality Total ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Linear Models ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Mercury ', ' Hg element ', ' Metals ', ' Methods ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity -

"Impact of Interventions on Future Trends in Subnational Burden of Cardiovascular Diseases in the US PROJECT SUMMARY Geographic and racial/ethnic disparities in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) – the leading cause of death in the U.S. – remain large. Since 2010, CVD death rates are no longer declining in many states, and for some groups, mortality is increasing. Reduction in CVD disparities is a major stated goal of U.S. health policy, but national-level strategies, such as Healthy People 2020 and the Million Hearts campaign, do not directly address these large geographic differences in CVD between states. The U.S. is rich in local health data, yet it is poorly integrated, so there is little evidence available to guide states or local health systems when selecting among primary prevention interventions and policies. Health policy models are an important way to integrate complex patterns of risk exposure and disease burden with other population trends including income, education, aging, migration, and health care access. Previous CVD forecasts and policy models have produced only single geography – primarily national – estimates, which cannot provide the evidence needed to address geographic disparities. The overarching goal for this study will be: a systematic analysis of why CVD patterns vary by age, sex, race/ethnicity, and state in the U.S.; how this variation will lead to future divergence in CVD mortality rates; and the variable impact that similar risk reduction strategies will then have on different U.S. states. For this work, we will adapt econometric, geospatial, and epidemiologic modelling methods by leveraging the large data and computational resources of the Global Burden of Disease Study. Aim 1 is a CVD population health projection that will estimate future burden of CVD for each U.S. state by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Using observed past trends in CVD and major modifiable causal risk factors, we will project health loss due to CVD, including disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), through 2040 for each U.S. state. We will integrate multiple sources of existing health surveillance data with the results of state-level health examination surveys. Estimates will be produced separately by sex and 5-year age groups, for four collectively exhaustive race/ethnicity categories for CVD overall, and separately for ischemic heart disease, heart failure, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, aortic aneurysm, and chronic kidney disease. Aim 2 is a new set of CVD health policy models that estimate the impact within each state of interventions shown to improve the delivery of pharmacotherapies that lower blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol. Aim 3 is a new set of CVD health policy models that estimate the impact of behavioral interventions shown to reduce CVD risk factors. Projections and policy models for CVD are a necessary step in reducing U.S. health disparities. Our results will be able to guide local decision-makers considering a range of policy options to reduce the burden of CVD. We will then implement a broad dissemination plan designed to expand the impact of our work beyond academic audiences, providing webinars, policy reports, and outreach to health departments and other stakeholders actively engaged in policy work in key states. PROJECT NARRATIVE The proposed project is a systematic analysis of why the burden of cardiovascular diseases vary by race/ethnicity and state in the U.S., the extent to which this variation will lead to future divergence in mortality rates, and the variable impact that similar risk reduction strategies will have on different U.S. states. This project will build on the data and computational infrastructure of the Global Burden of Disease Study to: a) produce a new set of population health projections stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, estimating the trajectory of cardiovascular diseases for the next 20 years in each U.S. state, and b) develop new health policy models that allow each state to examine the local impact of a broad range of interventions that improve cardiometabolic health. The results of this project will provide new evidence on the impact of interventions tailored to each U.S. state, allowing policymakers to improve their selection of policies that can reduce

"Hotspotting Cardiometabolic Disparities for Simulated Advances in Population Care Project Summary Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major public health problem, particularly for patients and neighborhoods with low socioeconomic status. Growing evidence has encouraged health systems to explore the use of community health workers (CHWs) to improve screening and management of CVD and cardiometabolic risks (CMR) among patients and communities with disparate disease burden. Yet broad systems change has been limited by a lack of outcome and cost data of sufficient scope and duration. We propose using innovative systems-science methods to model and analyze the effectiveness and cost of individually-targeted and neighborhood-targeted CHW interventions to reduce CVD disparities. The results will provide sought-after guidance for health systems implementation of optimally targeted programs to improve population health disparities. Public health in general will benefit significantly from the creation and validation of a systems-based framework for targeting communities experiencing CVD disparities with coordinated clinic- and community-based CHW programs. By merging spatial hotspot analysis with established microsimulation, this study's innovative methodology will provide novel and actionable knowledge based on simulated large- scale implementation of CHW interventions currently supported by small-scale trial data, yielding a replicable means for health systems and policymakers to identify, model, and improve health disparities in the future. The project has five stages. Stage 1: Data collection, geocoding, and spatial aggregation of de-identified data; Stage 2: identification of geographic hotspots of CVD and spatial statistical analysis to determine factors of neighborhood risk; Stage 3: adaptation of our established microsimulation model to the disease, demographic, and social characteristics of hotspots and to the parameters of CHW interventions; Stage 4: microsimulation modeling of clinic-based CHW interventions targeted to patients with individual and neighborhood CVD risks and community-based CHW programs targeted to neighborhoods according to disparate burdens of CMR and CVD; Stage 5: comparison of the disease outcomes, geographic clustering of CVD, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability for CHW interventions for CMR and CVD along 2-, 10-, and 20-year time frames. We will collect, de-identify, and aggregate service data from the 2 safety-net health care systems serving most patients and high-risk communities in a Midwestern metropolitan area. That data will provide a granular view of the neighborhood distribution of CVD and CMR illness burden across the metropolitan area to allow for robust spatial analysis and microsimulation modeling. Microsimulation analyses informed by empiric data will allow us to compare the effects of targeted clinic- and community-based CHW programs on disparities within communities across the metropolitan area. By melding spatial hotspot analysis with microsimulation in an innovative systems-science approach, this study will provide useful insights into the impact, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability of programs to reduce CVD disparities that are currently supported only by pilot data. Project Narrative This project will provide evidence for health systems change to address community health by (1) using geographic hotspot analysis to identify communities with disparate cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden and neighborhood risk, then (2) populating a detailed microsimulation model with empirical data from those populations, in order to (3) compare the impact of individual and neighborhood targeting of community health worker efforts on CVD outcomes and disparities, cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability over short-, intermediate-, and long-term horizons.",Hotspotting Cardiometabolic Disparities for Simulated Advances in Population Care,9984222,R01AG052533,"['Adoption ', ' Attention ', ' Cardiovascular Diseases ', ' cardiovascular disorder ', ' Censuses ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Aides ', ' community health worker ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' cost effectiveness ', ' Data Collection ', ' Statistical Data Interpretation ', ' Statistical Data Analyses ', ' Statistical Data Analysis ', ' statistical analysis ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Future ', ' Geography ', ' Health ', ' Healthcare Systems ', ' Health Care Systems ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' health care worker ', ' health provider ', ' health workforce ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' medical personnel ', ' treatment provider ', ' Hospitals ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Inpatients ', ' Investments ', ' Long-Term Effects ', ' Longterm Effects ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Minnesota ', ' Neighborhoods ', ' Outpatients ', ' Out-patients ', ' Patients ', ' Public Health ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Risk ', ' Science ', ' Social Characteristics ', ' Standardization ', ' Testing ', ' Time ', ' Computerized Medical Record ', ' Electronic Medical Record ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Acute ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' insight ', ' Individual ', ' Program Sustainabilities ', ' Program Sustainability ', ' programs ', ' Adopted ', ' Event ', ' Clinic ', ' System ', ' Services ', ' experience ', ' Medicare/Medicaid ', ' metropolitan ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' simulation ', ' Disease Outcome ', ' novel ', ' Geographic Distribution ', ' disease risk ', ' disorder risk ', ' Manpower ', ' personnel ', ' Human Resources ', ' Modeling ', ' deprivation ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention ', ' cardiovascular disease risk ', ' cardiovascular disorder risk ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Effectiveness ', ' low SES ', ' low socio-economic position ', ' low socio-economic status ', ' low socioeconomic position ', ' low socioeconomic status ', ' Low income ', ' Address ', ' Health system ', ' Data ', ' Validation ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cost ', ' burden of disease ', ' disease burden ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' Outcome ', ' cost effective ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' safety net ', ' demographics ', ' high risk ', ' clinical care ', ' evidence base ', ' population health ', ' screening ', ' Patient risk ', ' cardiometabolic risk ', ' dynamical system ', ' dynamic system ', ' individual patient ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' compare cost effectiveness ', ' comparative cost effectiveness ', ' cardiometabolic ', ' cardiometabolism ', ' Infrastructure ', ' sociodeterminant ', ' social determinants ', ' data deidentification ', ' de-identified data ', ' deidentified data ', ' data de-identification ', ' ']",NIA,HEALTHPARTNERS INSTITUTE,R01,2020,496463,0.1596444042281499
"Project Title: PROSPECT: Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic Disease Trends PROJECT SUMMARY  Despite efforts to prevent chronic diseases, they continue to increase, with underserved ethnic minorities bearing the greatest burden. The United States (US) territory of Puerto Rico (PR) has high prevalence of multiple cardiometabolic conditions that increase risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence supports a direct link between psychosocial and food-related environmental risk factors, and cardiometabolic conditions, but these remain markedly understudied at the island-wide population level in PR, despite the clear and pressing need to alleviate the burden of chronic disease in the island. On September 2017, hurricane Maria devastated PR, imposing urgency for studying trends and associations of risk factors for cardiometabolic conditions under times of distress. Thus, the overall goal for this application is to identify trends and longitudinal associations in psychosocial, food-related, and cardiometabolic risk factors that can guide public health priorities and future research needs aimed at reducing CVD-related disparities in PR. To this end, we will establish `PROSPECT: Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic disease Trends', an island-wide, longitudinal population cohort of 2,000 adults (30-75y) in PR recruited with a multi-frame sampling of probabilistic plus community approaches, and assessed in a network of several partner clinics across the island. The study will collect comprehensive data on multiple psychosocial, dietary, and food-related factors, CVD biological markers, and medical record data, with follow-up at 2-years, and will assess variations by urban-rural area and by timing before-after Maria. PROSPECT builds upon the feasibility and resources established by a 2015 pilot study in PR, and emulates the goals and methods of US and Caribbean cohorts inclusive of mainland Puerto Ricans and other Latinos for comparison.  Our specific aims are to: (1) estimate baseline and 2y prevalence of psychosocial, diet and food-related environment, and biological CVD risk factors, (2) determine longitudinal associations between 2y changes in psychosocial factors and biological CVD risk factors, (3) determine longitudinal associations between 2y changes in diet and food-related factors, and biological CVD risk factors, and (4) estimate differences in prevalence and 2y changes in risk factors by urban vs. rural area, and pre vs. post-Maria.  PROSPECT will identify priorities for addressing CVD risk factors, and will let us plan and implement tailored public health programs and interventions to effectively improve cardiometabolic health in a high-risk, underserved group. The project will enhance collaborative health research, leadership, and capacity in PR, and has high potential for sustainability by using existing infrastructure, and for comparability with US cohorts. Our new island-wide probabilistic comprehensive longitudinal study will bridge a gap in knowledge in PR, create a biorepository and participant database for future use, yield seminal data to support tailored translation into programs and policy, and compellingly reduce disparities in cardiometabolic health in PR. NARRATIVE Cardiometabolic conditions, and the psychosocial and food-related (e.g. diet) factors that may influence them, have not been properly studied in Puerto Rico (PR), despite high prevalence of chronic disease in this US territory. This is important to understand after hurricane Maria. Our goal is to build a longitudinal island-wide population cohort of adults in PR (`PROSPECT') with comprehensive data on risk factors and cardiovascular biomarkers, in order to enhance collaborative health research, leadership, and capacity in PR, create a biorepository and participant database, and yield seminal data on trends that can guide tailored public health programs and policy and future research aimed at reducing cardiometabolic disparities in PR.","Project Title: PROSPECT: Puerto Rico Observational Study of Psychosocial, Environmental, and Chronic Disease
