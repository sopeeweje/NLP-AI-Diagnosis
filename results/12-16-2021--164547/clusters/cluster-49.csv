"Comprehensive MMC/VICC Cancer Research Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) It is well known that minority groups suffer disproportionately from cancers with disparities existing in both the mortality and incidence rates. Other well-recognized problems are the paucity of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and the disproportionate number of minorities being entered into clinical trials. Meharry Medical College (MMC) has a distinguished history of training a large percentage of the African American physicians currently active in the United States. While MMC has long been active in cancer research, the promise of these activities has not yet reached fruition. Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) is a research intensive NCI-designated cancer center with very strong basic, translational, clinical, prevention and population-based research programs. MMC and VICC are located approximately two miles apart within Nashville. There has been a long history of faculty interactions between the two institutions, and the more recent establishment of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance has provided the infrastructure for the rapid development of a MSI/CC partnership with support from the CCSG supplement. The overall objectives of this U54 application are to strengthen and expand the existing partnership for cancer research between MMC and the VICC to achieve three ends: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC; (2) to create stable, long term collaborative relationships between MMC and the VICC in cancer research, research training and career development; and, (3) to improve the effectiveness of MMC and the VICC in conducting activities focused on the disproportionate incidence, mortality and morbidity in minority populations in the mid-south. The programs we have designed to achieve these ends are guided by modest cores for administration at each institution and for planning and evaluation. Research activities for the project are contained in a development core that consists of components in basic science, cancer prevention, outcomes and outreach, and clinical investigations. We propose funding of six pilot projects and four shared resources. Two basic scientists, one medical oncologist one surgical oncologists and two epidemiologists, will be recruited to join the MMC faculty with joint appointments at Vanderbilt under the auspices of this grant. We propose career development of MMC faculty through formal training programs and training of a minority medical oncologist, minority research nurses and data managers, minority Ph.D. candidates, and MMC medical students in basic and clinical cancer research.

"Partnership to Increase Hispanic Cancer Research for Co* DESCRIPTION: (Applicant?s Description) This proposal titled ""Partnership to Increase Hispanic Cancer Research for Colorado"", is a partnership approach to reduce the disparities of cancer, cancer control, and prevention activities in the Hispanic community across Colorado. The University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) and the University of Southern Colorado (USC) an Hispanic Serving Institution) will work in collaboration to increase community education of cancer, increase the pool of qualified undergraduates and graduates pursuing a career in cancer research and establish cancer research projects conducted at USC in collaboration with scientists at UCCCC.  The goal of this application is to develop a sustainable partnership between the two institutions creating an infrastructure for ongoing cancer research and cancer education. There are four specific objectives of this long-term collaborative program between the UCCCC and USC: 1) To increase the participation of USC in research relevant to cancer; 2) To increase the effectiveness of the UCCCC via the USC partnership in cancer training/education for Hispanics in Colorado; 3) To develop NCI-funded collaborative research between the faculty of the UCCCC and USC in cancer biology and cancer prevention; and 4) To positively impact the cancer problem among Hispanics in Colorado by strengthening the research expertise and cancer educational programs at both institutions. Our objectives will be met by joint USC-UCCCC collaborations to achieve the following five specific aims:  1) Develop and implement a cancer research pilot program at USC;  2) Sustain academic interactions between USC and UCCCC via academic exchanges of faculty in both directions;  3) Develop a pre-collegiate cancer biosciences outreach educational program at USC;  4) Expand the already successful pre-collegiate biosciences educational outreach programs at USC to include a cancer focus effectively supporting the educational pipeline of Hispanic students to both institutions; and  5) Expand the curricula of the to the USC Nursing Department in terms of graduate offerings in the area of oncology, career development, and oncology colloquiums.   During the course of this proposal pilot research projects will be developed. These projects will be conducted at USC in collaboration with UCCCC and include research in the specific areas of attachment and metastasis, environmental contaminants and the etiology of breast and prostate cancer, and analysis of the p53 gene mutation. These projects will serve to increase the participation of USC in research relevant to cancer by establishing collaborations between faculty of both institutions and, as a result, provide training in the area of cancer research for Hispanic undergraduate and graduate students attending USC. To accomplish this, we propose to establish formal clinical partnerships to enhance training opportunities for minority scientists and to establish formal academic partnerships to facilitate planning and pursuit of pilot projects. Part of this formal partnership will involve the expansion of undergraduate oncology nursing research and education and the collaborative development of a post-graduate nursing program with an emphasis in oncology nursing education in a rural setting. The outcome of the project with have a positive impact on both  the institutions and communities involved in the collaboration but additionally. Additionally, and more importantly, it has potential to impact cancer incidence and outcomes within Colorado through our increased collaborative cancer research, education and clinical practice endeavors.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Partnership Program The University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCFCC) and San Francisco State University (SFSU) propose a U56 program that combines research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer, a training program to prepare minority students for highly competitive Ph.D. programs with a focus on cancer research and health disparities., and a recruitment activity that will result in establishment of a biobehavioral research center focused on cancer research at SFSU. Our plan also incorporates community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities within our pilot projects and pilot programs. Our proposal is the result of extensive planning between faculty and administrators at the UCSFCC and SFSU which has taken into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions can complement and strengthen each other's work. The resulting proposed activities were selected to benefit both partners and surrounding community, especially economically disadvantaged neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. A major effort will be direct at increasing the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally underrepresented in biomedical and biobehavioral research, and eliminating health disparities. Faculty and administrators from the UCSFCC and SFSU are committed to this program and will continue to work together to develop a stable cancer research program at SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, and to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the UCSFCC/SFSU partnership and the support of the NCI.

"Comprehensive MMC/VICC Cancer Research Partnership It is well known that minority groups suffer disproportionately from cancers with disparities existing in both the mortality and incidence rates. Other well-recognized problems are the paucity of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and the disproportionate number of minorities being entered into clinical trials. Meharry Medical College (MMC) has a distinguished history of training a large percentage of the African American physicians currently active in the United States. While MMC has long been active in cancer research, the promise of these activities has not yet reached fruition. Vanderbilt- Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) is a research intensive NCI-designated cancer center with very strong basic, translational, clinical, prevention and population-based research programs. MMC and VICC are located approximately two miles apart within Nashville. There has been a long history of faculty interactions between the two institutions, and the more recent establishment of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance has provided the infrastructure for the rapid development of a MSI/CC partnership with support from the CCSG supplement. The overall objectives of this U54 application are to strengthen and expand the existing partnership for cancer research between MMC and the VICC to achieve three ends: (1) to expand the existing partnership for cancer research between MMC and the VICC to achieve three ends: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC; (2) to create, stable, long term collaborative relationships between MMC and VICC in conducting activities focused on the disproportionate incidence, mortality and morbidity in minority populations in the mid-south. The programs we have designed to achieve these ends are guided by modest cores for administration at each institution and for planning and evaluation. Research activities for the project are contained in a development core that consists of components in basic science, cancer prevention, outcomes and outreach, and clinical investigations. We propose funding of six pilot projects and four shared resources. Two basic scientists, one medical oncologist, one surgical oncologists and two epidemiologists, will be recruited to join the MMC faculty with joint appointments at Vanderbilt under the auspices of this grant. We propose career development of MMC faculty through formal training programs and training of a minority medical oncologist, minority research nurses and data managers, minority Ph.D. candidates, and MMC medical students in basic and clinical cancer research.

"UAB Comprehensive Cancer Ctr/Tuskegee Univ Partnership Ethnic minorities continue to suffer a disparage burden from this disease even though there has been a drop in the overall incidence of cancer mortality. For example, African Americans have a higher mortality rate for breast, colorectal, long, prostate, and cervical cancer. Minority Serving Institutions such as Tuskegee University and Comprehensive Cancer Centers such as the University of Alabama at Birmingham each play a significant role conducting high quality research and educational programs designed to eliminate this disparity. By joining together in a partnership, each institution is thus able to enhance the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses of the respective institutions in respect to cancer research. We propose to utilize this P20 Planning Grant to develop a sustain a collaboration between Tuskegee University (TU) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC). This partnership will be forged through the develops of programs in the following areas of cancer: 1) research, 2) research training and career development, 3) education, and 4) community outreach. We propose that this partnership will: 1) provide TU researchers with training opportunities in cancer research being conducted at UABCCC, 2) increase the number of TU students in cancer research, 3) increase the number of minority research with Bioethics training, and 4) expose both UABCCC and TU researchers to training in the areas of Bioethics in research, cultural sensitivity, and community outreach research. In addition, urban and rural AFRICAN American communities will reap benefits from the development and implementation of the proposed programs.

"Partnership To Increase Hispanic Cancer Res/Edu. in Col. DESCRIPTION: (Applicant?s Description) The University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) and the University of Southern Colorado(USC; a Minority Institution will work in collaboration to increase the pool of qualified students pursuing a career in cancer research, and to establish cancer research projects conducted at USC in collaboration with UCCCC. This proposal is a partnership approach aimed at reducing the disparities in cancer control and prevention, and to develop a pipeline for students from secondary education through undergraduate programs in the region to access graduate programs at UCCCC. The proposed pilot cancer research projects conducted at USC in collaboration with UCCCC include research in the specific areas of attachment and metastasis, analysis of the p53 gene mutation in both lung and breast cancer, and determination of the relationship between environmental insults and cancer incidence in the geographical area of Pueblo County, Colorado. These projects will serve to increase the participation of USC in research relevant to cancer by establishing collaborations between faculty at both institutions. To accomplish this we propose to establish formal clinical/academic partnerships to enhance training opportunities for minority scientists. Part of this formal partnership will involve the expansion of undergraduate oncology nursing research and education and the collaborative development of a post-graduate nursing program with an emphasis in oncology training in a rural setting. To address the lack of cancer education within the Colorado minority community we propose to generate an educational tract that links high school students to USC through a summer Pre-Collegiate Program. This linkage will continue at the college level with the development of a pipeline from two-year institutions to a 4-year program at USC. In addition, a week-long cancer educational workshop will be included in the established Bridges to Biomedical Careers program currently existing at USC, a program designed to increase the qualified pool of Hispanic students pursuing a biomedical research degree. We intend to enhance cancer awareness through these educational pipeline projects and to stimulate an interest in cancer research by these pipeline students. The outcome of this project will have a positive impact on both the institutions and communities involved in the collaboration and additionally it has the potential to impact cancer incidence and outcomes within Colorado through our increased collaborative cancer research, education and clinical practice endeavors.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive cancer Partnership Program San Francisco State University (SFSU) and the University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSFCC) propose a 56 planning program comprised of two research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer and a training program to encourage and prepare minority nursing students to earn Ph.D. degrees focusing on cancer research and health disparities. It also includes community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities incorporated within the pilot projects and program. One of the major activities of the proposed program is a recruitment activity that will result in the immediate hiring of a senior-level biobehavioral researcher at SFSU and, over the next five years, the hiring of six junior-faculty researchers-all of whom will form the core of a new Biobehavioral Research Center at SFSU.. The President of SFSU has committed $1M to help build-out this new Center, and to allocating ongoing personnel funds for a tenured, senior level professor to fill this position. The proposal is the result of extensive planning among faculty and administrators at SFSU and the UCSFCC who took into careful consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions could complement and strengthen each other's work. Projects, programs, and activities selected for this proposal are those that will mutually benefit both partners and surrounding neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. One such direct benefit will be the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials.

"Building Minority Cancer Research Capacity: NMSU & FHCRC Minorities are more likely to suffer the ill effects of cancer than their white counterparts and few enter the field of cancer research. In response to these disparities, NCI has initiated a Minority Institution (MI)/Cancer Center (CC) Partnership program. The program is directed at building cancer research capacity at the MI and increasing the number of under- represented minorities involved in cancer research. New Mexico State University (NMSU) is a Carnegie Foundation ""Doctoral/Research University-Extensive"" MI with a successful history of training underrepresented and conducting biomedical research. Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) is an internationally recognized NCI designated cancer center. The partnership between NMSU and FHCRC will provide NMSU formal access to resources and expertise in cancer research. The FHCRC will gain a formal linking with an accomplished NI in order to increase minority presence in its training and research programs. The long term objective of this program is to build cancer research capacity at NMSU and increase minority participation in FHCRC cancer research and education programs. The objectives of this partnership are to: 1) Establish a long-lasting infrastructure to conduct cancer research at NMSU. Components of the infrastructure will include a) a plan for recruiting new and existing NMSU faculty into cancer research; 2) the development of an exchange program for faculty and students between the two institutions; and c) the establishment of a research curriculum t NMSU that will increase knowledge of and skills to address cancer disparities among minority populations. 2.) Develop a structure to recruit, train, train, and mentor undergraduate and graduate minority students for careers in cancer research. Building on existing programs at NMSU, formal links will be established to ensure that such avenues are available for minority students. 3) Provide both NMSU and FHCRC with new research experiences that will benefit scientists at both institutions as well as the populations served by each institution. This will be accomplished initially by conducting 5 pilot projects during the first three years of the grant with others to follow in years 4 and 5.

"PRCC/MDACC:Partners for Excellence in Cancer Research DESCRIPTION: (Applicant's Description) Significant disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes exist among ethnic minority populations. Addressing this disparities requires a combined effort from Minority Serving Institutions, and Comprehensive Cancer Centers. The overall goal of this project is to establish a comprehensive long-term partnership between the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (UTMDACC) and the University of Puerto Rico Cancer Center (PRCC) which was initiated three years ago through the support of a P30 grant. Specific objectives of this project include: a) the development of independent investigators through collaborative research projects, b) establishing a stable, long-term collaborative relation between UTMDACC and PRCC in the areas of cancer research, training, and career development, and c) improving the effectiveness of UTMDACC activities designed to benefit the Hispanic population and other minority populations served by the institution. Specifically, efforts will be focused on the development of collaboration in the following areas: 1) Cancer research. Two major and two pilot projects have been identified, 2) Research training. PRCC and UTMDACC will continue the establishment of a comprehensive pipeline program ; 3) Combined infrastructure. Include the frequent use of videoconferences, library services, and establishment of a tissue bank. In addition, a program will be developed which will eventually allow PRCC to establish its own Department of Scientific Publications and Biostatistic Support. Furthermore, this grant will support the recruitment efforts of the PRCC to develop the necessary critical mass in cancer research. By sharing resources and combining the unique strengths and capabilities of the two institutions, it is expected that this collaboration will result in improved research capability, increasing numbers of minority cancer investigators, and more focused and successful attempt to address the disproportionate burden of cancer in Hispanic populations. Both institutions will benefit extremely through the interactions. The extensive interactions will enhance the opportunities for both institutions for apply for SPORES, PC1 and other grants with emphasis on minority/disparity populations. Finally, the one of the major goals of the PRCC is to regain the status of an NCI-designated Cancer Center.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Partnership Program The University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCFCC) and San Francisco State University (SFSU) propose a U56 program that combines research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer, a training program to prepare minority students for highly competitive Ph.D. programs with a focus on cancer research and health disparities., and a recruitment activity that will result in establishment of a biobehavioral research center focused on cancer research at SFSU. Our plan also incorporates community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities within our pilot projects and pilot programs. Our proposal is the result of extensive planning between faculty and administrators at the UCSFCC and SFSU which has taken into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions can complement and strengthen each other's work. The resulting proposed activities were selected to benefit both partners and surrounding community, especially economically disadvantaged neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. A major effort will be direct at increasing the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally underrepresented in biomedical and biobehavioral research, and eliminating health disparities. Faculty and administrators from the UCSFCC and SFSU are committed to this program and will continue to work together to develop a stable cancer research program at SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, and to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the UCSFCC/SFSU partnership and the support of the NCI.

Chambers Biomedical Biotechnology Research Institute (UNC LCCC) at North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (UNC LCCC) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) propose to continue an effective, sustainable, and mutually beneficial partnership in cancer research that focuses on African-American health disparities. During the past year and with funding from the National Cancer Institute, the two institutions have firmly established the Partnership by building on complementary institutional strengths conducting joint planning in the molecular and population sciences, and emphasizing a concrete and feasible ""gateway"" initiative: establishment of an NCCU Cancer Core Laboratory for molecular/genetic analysis in cancer research. The Partnership now proposes to expand its initiatives through an NCI-funded Cooperative Planning Grant (U56) for Comprehensive Minority Institution/Cancer Partnership. In addition to continued efforts in molecular/genetic analysis and the Cancer Core Laboratory, the Partnership will emphasize a series of linked gateway pilot initiatives, accompanied by technology transfer, that lead toward a major collaborative research project (with outreach/health education components) a population-based cohort study of prostate cancer in African-American men. This project will be a major focus of the planned application for a Comprehensive Minority Institution/Cancer Center Partnership (U54 CMI/CCP) grant. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: two pilot research projects (assay development and cohort development); a pilot program in outreach and education; resource and infrastructure enhancement centering on the JLC-BBRI Cancer Core Laboratory; and career development for junior faculty and students. The UNC Lineberger and UNC-Chapel Hill offer the Partnership: 1) extensive experience, expertise, and resources for cancer research and training; and 2) a demonstrated interest in minority health disparities. The JLC-BBRI and NCCU offer the Partnership: 1) experience and expertise in reaching minority populations through culturally appropriate and sensitive interventions; 2) opportunities to access minority populations; and 3) training opportunities for minority students potentially interested in careers in cancer research. These complementary institutional strengths will help the Partnership: 1) establish an effective cancer research infrastructure/program and increase training opportunities at a minority serving institution; and 2) enhance community- and population-based research targeting minority cancer-related health disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI funded Coin comprehensive Cancer Center.

"Comprehensive MMC/VICC Cancer Research Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) It is well known that minority groups suffer disproportionately from cancers with disparities existing in both the mortality and incidence rates. Other well-recognized problems are the paucity of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and the disproportionate number of minorities being entered into clinical trials. Meharry Medical College (MMC) has a distinguished history of training a large percentage of the African American physicians currently active in the United States. While MMC has long been active in cancer research, the promise of these activities has not yet reached fruition. Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) is a research intensive NCI-designated cancer center with very strong basic, translational, clinical, prevention and population-based research programs. MMC and VICC are located approximately two miles apart within Nashville. There has been a long history of faculty interactions between the two institutions, and the more recent establishment of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance has provided the infrastructure for the rapid development of a MSI/CC partnership with support from the CCSG supplement. The overall objectives of this U54 application are to strengthen and expand the existing partnership for cancer research between MMC and the VICC to achieve three ends: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC; (2) to create stable, long term collaborative relationships between MMC and the VICC in cancer research, research training and career development; and, (3) to improve the effectiveness of MMC and the VICC in conducting activities focused on the disproportionate incidence, mortality and morbidity in minority populations in the mid-south. The programs we have designed to achieve these ends are guided by modest cores for administration at each institution and for planning and evaluation. Research activities for the project are contained in a development core that consists of components in basic science, cancer prevention, outcomes and outreach, and clinical investigations. We propose funding of six pilot projects and four shared resources. Two basic scientists, one medical oncologist one surgical oncologists and two epidemiologists, will be recruited to join the MMC faculty with joint appointments at Vanderbilt under the auspices of this grant. We propose career development of MMC faculty through formal training programs and training of a minority medical oncologist, minority research nurses and data managers, minority Ph.D. candidates, and MMC medical students in basic and clinical cancer research.

"Partnership To Increase Hispanic Cancer Res/Edu. in Col. DESCRIPTION: (Applicant?s Description) The University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) and the University of Southern Colorado(USC; a Minority Institution will work in collaboration to increase the pool of qualified students pursuing a career in cancer research, and to establish cancer research projects conducted at USC in collaboration with UCCCC. This proposal is a partnership approach aimed at reducing the disparities in cancer control and prevention, and to develop a pipeline for students from secondary education through undergraduate programs in the region to access graduate programs at UCCCC. The proposed pilot cancer research projects conducted at USC in collaboration with UCCCC include research in the specific areas of attachment and metastasis, analysis of the p53 gene mutation in both lung and breast cancer, and determination of the relationship between environmental insults and cancer incidence in the geographical area of Pueblo County, Colorado. These projects will serve to increase the participation of USC in research relevant to cancer by establishing collaborations between faculty at both institutions. To accomplish this we propose to establish formal clinical/academic partnerships to enhance training opportunities for minority scientists. Part of this formal partnership will involve the expansion of undergraduate oncology nursing research and education and the collaborative development of a post-graduate nursing program with an emphasis in oncology training in a rural setting. To address the lack of cancer education within the Colorado minority community we propose to generate an educational tract that links high school students to USC through a summer Pre-Collegiate Program. This linkage will continue at the college level with the development of a pipeline from two-year institutions to a 4-year program at USC. In addition, a week-long cancer educational workshop will be included in the established Bridges to Biomedical Careers program currently existing at USC, a program designed to increase the qualified pool of Hispanic students pursuing a biomedical research degree. We intend to enhance cancer awareness through these educational pipeline projects and to stimulate an interest in cancer research by these pipeline students. The outcome of this project will have a positive impact on both the institutions and communities involved in the collaboration and additionally it has the potential to impact cancer incidence and outcomes within Colorado through our increased collaborative cancer research, education and clinical practice endeavors.

"Univ of Guam/Cancer Res Center of Hawaii Partnership    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)  The University of Guam (UOG) is the only four-year institution of higher learning in the Western Pacific serving the U.S. territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as all of Micronesia. The University offers BS and BA degrees in well over 30 disciplines as well as Master degrees in eight different areas. The student population consists of approximately 50% Pacific Islanders, 32% Filipino, 9% Caucasians, 8% Asians, and 1% other minorities. The University operates   several interdisciplinary research programs including marine biology, water and environmental research, Micronesian language and area studies, and Micronesian health and aging studies.      The Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (CRCH) is an NCI-designated cancer center at the University of Hawaii. The CRCH is currently the only NCI-designated Cancer Center at a minority-serving institution. There are four research programs established at the CRCH, along with a large clinical trials unit and the Hawaii Tumor Registry. Research efforts at the CRCH take particular advantage of the research opportunities provided in Hawaii which includes the multiethnic population in the State of Hawaii and their vastly different risks of developing cancer at different organ sites. Accordingly, research addressing health disparities in different ethnic groups and minorities along with a particular awareness of cultural sensitivity are major characteristics of the CRCH.        CRCH and UOG have a track record of approximately 15 years of successful research cooperation in the area of natural products drug discovery. The two institutions plan to develop their successful research cooperation into a long-term partnership of mutual benefit in the area of cancer research, cancer training and career development, and cancer outreach. This application for a U56 comprehensive planning grant for a Minority Institution/Cancer Center Partnership has the following objectives: a) to increase the cancer research capabilities in a variety of different disciplines at the UOG, b) to increase the number of minority scientists of Pacific Islander ancestry engaged in cancer research or other cancer related activities by providing pertinent undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate training opportunities, c) to provide career development for cancer investigators at the UOG in order to develop and sustain independently funded cancer research programs at the UOG, d) to further strengthen the focus of research, training, and outreach activities at the CRCH on the disproportionate incidence, mortality, and morbidity in minority populations by including the Territory of Guam into the region served by the CRCH, and e) to ultimately reduce the impact of cancer on the population in the Territory of Guam (and possibly other U.S. island territories in the Pacific) by enhancing the awareness of cancer prevention opportunities and improving the quality of care for cancer patients.

"Comprehensive MMC/VICC Cancer Research Partnership It is well known that minority groups suffer disproportionately from cancers with disparities existing in both the mortality and incidence rates. Other well-recognized problems are the paucity of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and the disproportionate number of minorities being entered into clinical trials. Meharry Medical College (MMC) has a distinguished history of training a large percentage of the African American physicians currently active in the United States. While MMC has long been active in cancer research, the promise of these activities has not yet reached fruition. Vanderbilt- Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) is a research intensive NCI-designated cancer center with very strong basic, translational, clinical, prevention and population-based research programs. MMC and VICC are located approximately two miles apart within Nashville. There has been a long history of faculty interactions between the two institutions, and the more recent establishment of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance has provided the infrastructure for the rapid development of a MSI/CC partnership with support from the CCSG supplement. The overall objectives of this U54 application are to strengthen and expand the existing partnership for cancer research between MMC and the VICC to achieve three ends: (1) to expand the existing partnership for cancer research between MMC and the VICC to achieve three ends: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC; (2) to create, stable, long term collaborative relationships between MMC and VICC in conducting activities focused on the disproportionate incidence, mortality and morbidity in minority populations in the mid-south. The programs we have designed to achieve these ends are guided by modest cores for administration at each institution and for planning and evaluation. Research activities for the project are contained in a development core that consists of components in basic science, cancer prevention, outcomes and outreach, and clinical investigations. We propose funding of six pilot projects and four shared resources. Two basic scientists, one medical oncologist, one surgical oncologists and two epidemiologists, will be recruited to join the MMC faculty with joint appointments at Vanderbilt under the auspices of this grant. We propose career development of MMC faculty through formal training programs and training of a minority medical oncologist, minority research nurses and data managers, minority Ph.D. candidates, and MMC medical students in basic and clinical cancer research.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Partnership Program The University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCFCC) and San Francisco State University (SFSU) propose a U56 program that combines research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer, a training program to prepare minority students for highly competitive Ph.D. programs with a focus on cancer research and health disparities., and a recruitment activity that will result in establishment of a biobehavioral research center focused on cancer research at SFSU. Our plan also incorporates community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities within our pilot projects and pilot programs. Our proposal is the result of extensive planning between faculty and administrators at the UCSFCC and SFSU which has taken into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions can complement and strengthen each other's work. The resulting proposed activities were selected to benefit both partners and surrounding community, especially economically disadvantaged neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. A major effort will be direct at increasing the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally underrepresented in biomedical and biobehavioral research, and eliminating health disparities. Faculty and administrators from the UCSFCC and SFSU are committed to this program and will continue to work together to develop a stable cancer research program at SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, and to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the UCSFCC/SFSU partnership and the support of the NCI.

"Partnership To Increase Hispanic Cancer Res/Edu. in Col. DESCRIPTION: (Applicant?s Description) The University of Colorado Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCCCC) and the University of Southern Colorado(USC; a Minority Institution will work in collaboration to increase the pool of qualified students pursuing a career in cancer research, and to establish cancer research projects conducted at USC in collaboration with UCCCC. This proposal is a partnership approach aimed at reducing the disparities in cancer control and prevention, and to develop a pipeline for students from secondary education through undergraduate programs in the region to access graduate programs at UCCCC. The proposed pilot cancer research projects conducted at USC in collaboration with UCCCC include research in the specific areas of attachment and metastasis, analysis of the p53 gene mutation in both lung and breast cancer, and determination of the relationship between environmental insults and cancer incidence in the geographical area of Pueblo County, Colorado. These projects will serve to increase the participation of USC in research relevant to cancer by establishing collaborations between faculty at both institutions. To accomplish this we propose to establish formal clinical/academic partnerships to enhance training opportunities for minority scientists. Part of this formal partnership will involve the expansion of undergraduate oncology nursing research and education and the collaborative development of a post-graduate nursing program with an emphasis in oncology training in a rural setting. To address the lack of cancer education within the Colorado minority community we propose to generate an educational tract that links high school students to USC through a summer Pre-Collegiate Program. This linkage will continue at the college level with the development of a pipeline from two-year institutions to a 4-year program at USC. In addition, a week-long cancer educational workshop will be included in the established Bridges to Biomedical Careers program currently existing at USC, a program designed to increase the qualified pool of Hispanic students pursuing a biomedical research degree. We intend to enhance cancer awareness through these educational pipeline projects and to stimulate an interest in cancer research by these pipeline students. The outcome of this project will have a positive impact on both the institutions and communities involved in the collaboration and additionally it has the potential to impact cancer incidence and outcomes within Colorado through our increased collaborative cancer research, education and clinical practice endeavors.

"Tuskegee Univ/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Ctr Partnership Ethnic minorities continue to suffer a disparate burden from this disease even though there has been a drop in the overall incidence of cancer mortality. For example, African Americans have a higher mortality rate for breast, colorectal, lung, prostate, and cervical cancer. Minority Serving Institutions such as Tuskegee University and Comprehensive Cancer Centers such as the University of Alabama at Birmingham each play a significant role conducting high quality research and educational programs designed to eliminate this disparity. By joining together in a partnership, each institution is thus able to enhance the strengths and eliminate the weaknesses of the respective institutions in respect to cancer research. We propose to utilize this P20 Planning Grant to develop a sustain a collaboration between Tuskegee University (TU) and the University of Alabama at Birmingham Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC). This partnership will be forged through the development of programs in the following areas of cancer: 1) research, 2) research training and career development, 3) education and 4) community outreach. We propose this partnership will: 1) provide TU researchers with training opportunities in cancer research being conducted at UABCCC, 2) increase the number of TU students in cancer research, 3) increase the number of minority researchers with Bioethics training and 4) expose both UABCCC and TU researchers to training in the areas of Bioethics in research, cultural sensitivity and community outreach research. In addition, urban and rural African American communities will reap benefits from the development and implementation of the proposed programs. Last but not least, a full sustainable partnership will enhance both institutions and make the elimination of the disparities between Caucasians and African Americans a real possibility by the year 2010- 2015.

"Building Minority Cancer Research Capacity: NMSU & FHCRC Background & Rationale: Minorities are more likely to suffer the ill effects of cancer than their white counterparts and few enter the field of cancer research. In response to these disparities, NCI has initiated a Minority Institution (MI)/Cancer Center (CC) Partnership Program.  The program is directed at building cancer research capacity at the MI and subsequently, increase the number of under-represented minorities involved in cancer research. New Mexico State University (NMSU) id s a Carnegie Foundation ""Doctoral/Research University-Extensive"" MI with a successful history of training underrepresented minorities and conducting biomedical research. Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) is an internationally recognized NCI designated cancer center. The partnership between NMSU and FHCRC will provide NMSU formal access to resources and expertise in cancer research. The FHCRC will gain a formal linking with an accomplished MI in order to increase minority presence in its training and research programs The long term objective of this program is to build cancer research capacity at NMSU and increase minority participation in FHCRC cancer research and education programs. Specific Aims & Methods: 1.) Establish a long- lasting infrastructure to conduct cancer research at NMSU. Components of the infrastructure at NMSU. Components of the infrastructure will include a) a plan for recruiting new and existing NMSU faculty into cancer research; b) the development of an exchange program for faculty and students between the two institutions; and c) the establishment of a research curriculum at NMSU that will increase knowledge of and skills to address cancer disparities among minority populations. 2.) Develop a structure to recruit, training, and mentor undergraduate and graduate minority students for careers in cancer research. Building on existing programs at NMSU, formal links will be established to ensure that such avenues are available for minority students. 3.) Provide both NMSU and FHCRC with new research experiences that will benefit scientists at both institutions as well as the populations served by each institution. This will be accomplished initially by conducting 5 pilot projects during the first 3 years of the grant with others to follow in years 4 and 5.

"Comprehensive MMC/VICC Cancer Research Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) It is well known that minority groups suffer disproportionately from cancers with disparities existing in both the mortality and incidence rates. Other well-recognized problems are the paucity of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and the disproportionate number of minorities being entered into clinical trials. Meharry Medical College (MMC) has a distinguished history of training a large percentage of the African American physicians currently active in the United States. While MMC has long been active in cancer research, the promise of these activities has not yet reached fruition. Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) is a research intensive NCI-designated cancer center with very strong basic, translational, clinical, prevention and population-based research programs. MMC and VICC are located approximately two miles apart within Nashville. There has been a long history of faculty interactions between the two institutions, and the more recent establishment of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance has provided the infrastructure for the rapid development of a MSI/CC partnership with support from the CCSG supplement. The overall objectives of this U54 application are to strengthen and expand the existing partnership for cancer research between MMC and the VICC to achieve three ends: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC; (2) to create stable, long term collaborative relationships between MMC and the VICC in cancer research, research training and career development; and, (3) to improve the effectiveness of MMC and the VICC in conducting activities focused on the disproportionate incidence, mortality and morbidity in minority populations in the mid-south. The programs we have designed to achieve these ends are guided by modest cores for administration at each institution and for planning and evaluation. Research activities for the project are contained in a development core that consists of components in basic science, cancer prevention, outcomes and outreach, and clinical investigations. We propose funding of six pilot projects and four shared resources. Two basic scientists, one medical oncologist one surgical oncologists and two epidemiologists, will be recruited to join the MMC faculty with joint appointments at Vanderbilt under the auspices of this grant. We propose career development of MMC faculty through formal training programs and training of a minority medical oncologist, minority research nurses and data managers, minority Ph.D. candidates, and MMC medical students in basic and clinical cancer research.

"Univ. of Guam/Cancer Res. Center of Hawaii Partnership The University of Guam (UOG) is the only four-year institution of higher learning in the Western Pacific serving the U.S. territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as all of Micronesia. The University offers BS and BA degrees in well over 30 disciplines as well as Master degrees in eight different areas. The student population consists of approximately 50% Pacific Islanders, 32% Filipino, 9% Caucasians, 8% Asians, and 1% other minorities. The University operates several interdisciplinary research programs including marine biology, water and environmental research, Micronesian language and area studies, and Micronesian health and aging studies. The Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (CRCH) is an NCI-designated cancer center at the University of Hawaii. The CRCH is currently the only NCI-designated Cancer Center at a minority-serving institution. There are four research programs established at the CRCH, along with a large clinical trials unit and the Hawaii Tumor Registry. Research efforts at the CRCH take particular advantage of the research opportunities provided in Hawaii which includes the multiethnic population in the State of Hawaii and their vastly different risks of developing cancer at different organ sites. Accordingly, research addressing health disparities in different ethnic groups and minorities along with a particular awareness of cultural sensitivity are major characteristics of the CRCH. CRCH and UOG have a track record of approximately 15 years of successful research cooperation in the area of natural products drug discovery. The two institutions plan to develop their successful research cooperation into a long-term partnership of mutual benefit in the area of cancer research, cancer training and career development, and cancer outreach. This application for a U56 comprehensive planning grant for a Minority Institution/Cancer Center Partnership has the following objectives: a) to increase the cancer research capabilities in a variety of different disciplines at the UOG, b) to increase the number of minority scientists of Pacific Islander ancestry engaged in cancer research or other cancer related activities by providing pertinent undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate training opportunities, c) to provide career development for cancer investigators at the UOG in order to develop and sustain independently funded cancer research programs at the UOG, d) to further strengthen the focus of research, training, and outreach activities at the CRCH on the disproportionate incidence, mortality, and morbidity in minority populations, e) to expand the geographic region of the U.S. served by CRCH to the Territory of Guam, and f) to ultimately reduce the impact of cancer on the population in the Territory of Guam (and possibly other U.S. island territories in the Pacific) by enhancing the awareness of cancer prevention opportunities and improving the quality of care for cancer patients.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Partnership Program The University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCFCC) and San Francisco State University (SFSU) propose a U56 program that combines research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer, a training program to prepare minority students for highly competitive Ph.D. programs with a focus on cancer research and health disparities., and a recruitment activity that will result in establishment of a biobehavioral research center focused on cancer research at SFSU. Our plan also incorporates community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities within our pilot projects and pilot programs. Our proposal is the result of extensive planning between faculty and administrators at the UCSFCC and SFSU which has taken into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions can complement and strengthen each other's work. The resulting proposed activities were selected to benefit both partners and surrounding community, especially economically disadvantaged neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. A major effort will be direct at increasing the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally underrepresented in biomedical and biobehavioral research, and eliminating health disparities. Faculty and administrators from the UCSFCC and SFSU are committed to this program and will continue to work together to develop a stable cancer research program at SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, and to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the UCSFCC/SFSU partnership and the support of the NCI.

"MMC and VICC: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC) and the Vanderbilt-lngram Comprehensive Cancer Center (VICC) over the past five years of their formal partnership. The bedrock of this pioneering collaboration has been the U54 from the NCI. Our partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our two institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award has moved our collaborative research program more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. Until recently, MMC viewed itself primarily as a teaching institution and, therefore, did not have a critical mass of researchers in cancer. MMC, with pivotal help from U54 funds, is growing its capacity but has a thriving concentration of cancer researchers in cancer biology, cancer epidemiology and clinical cancer research. The U54 has provided the major impetus for a bold restructuring of the basic science departments at MMC that will assure release time for MMC investigators. The Division of Cancer Biology, headed by Dr. Adunyah, Co-Pi of the U54 at MMC will consist of faculty with 80% release time for research. In cooperation with the U54 Pis, mentoring committees consisting of faculty from MMC and VICC will assist faculty in developing competitive research programs. This restructure was due, in part, to recommendations made by our Program Steering Committee at their 2003 and 2004 meetings. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this second phase of our partnership, we concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC and VICC. In addition to funding research studies, funds will be used to recruit investigators and strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research at MMC. A critical mass of researchers in all these areas will strengthen the quality of MMC/VICC collaborative efforts. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership between MMC and VICC is of immense benefit to the two participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. Our major collaborative successes including the Southern Community Cohort Study of urban and rural African Americans and Caucasians in the mid-South testify to our potential for meeting our goal of eliminating cancer disparities between African Americans and Caucasians.  ",MMC and VICC: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities,7226118,U54CA091405,[''],NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U54,2006,676136,0.05108091688677745
"Planning Grant for Bowie State University/University of Maryland Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer in Maryland, and its impact on the health of minority and underserved rural populations, is a particularly serious health care dilemma. In fact, Maryland now ranks 7th nationally in cancer incidence, and significant disparities are seen between African American and Caucasian populations in stage of diagnosis, access to early detection, cancer screening follow-up, treatment, and health services utilization. The unequal burden of cancer in minority and underserved communities nationally and in Maryland's minority and underserved communities is a compelling crisis that requires intensive scientific, community outreach and translation and application of research. Bowie State University (BSU), a Minority Serving Institution (MSI) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and its Program In Oncology and the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center propose to establish a partnership with the overall goal of reducing and eventually eliminating cancer health disparities experienced by minority populations in Prince George's county and Baltimore City, Maryland by increasing the number of minority scientists pursuing successful cancer research careers and developing effective cancer education programs specifically targeting minority students and faculty, and the community. The specific aims of the BSU-UMSOM partnership are: (1) To collaboratively develop and implement a joint minority cancer research career development training program (""Cancer Research Training Program"") in cancer health disparities research for BSU junior faculty; (2) To collaboratively enhance the science curriculum at BSU through the development, implementation, and evaluation of a cancer health disparities education curriculum (""Undergraduate Cancer Education Program"") to prepare BSU students for mentored undergraduate cancer research training at UMSOM; and (3) To collaboratively develop, implement, and pilot test an enhanced community-based caner outreach education program (""Community Cancer Outreach Education Program"") in price George's County specifically targeting minority, underserved communities (i.e., African Americans). The partnership's objectives blend the existing expertise at the collaborating institutions in the form of high- quality educational programs and a rich source of talent at BSU and the state-of-the-art cancer research, investigator training, and community outreach programs at UMSOM. This partnership is based on prior informal collaborations between members of faculty at BSU and UMSOM. The proposed partnership between BSU and UMSOM will address both community and institutional needs to effectively address cancer health disparities.              ",Planning Grant for Bowie State University/University of Maryland Cancer Research,7226517,P20CA119193,"['training ', ' university ', ' neoplasm /cancer ', ' community ', ' health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,BOWIE STATE UNIVERSITY,P20,2006,249694,0.12666493995259567
"Comprehensive MMC/VICC Cancer Research Partnership DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) It is well known that minority groups suffer disproportionately from cancers with disparities existing in both the mortality and incidence rates. Other well-recognized problems are the paucity of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and the disproportionate number of minorities being entered into clinical trials. Meharry Medical College (MMC) has a distinguished history of training a large percentage of the African American physicians currently active in the United States. While MMC has long been active in cancer research, the promise of these activities has not yet reached fruition. Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) is a research intensive NCI-designated cancer center with very strong basic, translational, clinical, prevention and population-based research programs. MMC and VICC are located approximately two miles apart within Nashville. There has been a long history of faculty interactions between the two institutions, and the more recent establishment of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance has provided the infrastructure for the rapid development of a MSI/CC partnership with support from the CCSG supplement. The overall objectives of this U54 application are to strengthen and expand the existing partnership for cancer research between MMC and the VICC to achieve three ends: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC; (2) to create stable, long term collaborative relationships between MMC and the VICC in cancer research, research training and career development; and, (3) to improve the effectiveness of MMC and the VICC in conducting activities focused on the disproportionate incidence, mortality and morbidity in minority populations in the mid-south. The programs we have designed to achieve these ends are guided by modest cores for administration at each institution and for planning and evaluation. Research activities for the project are contained in a development core that consists of components in basic science, cancer prevention, outcomes and outreach, and clinical investigations. We propose funding of six pilot projects and four shared resources. Two basic scientists, one medical oncologist one surgical oncologists and two epidemiologists, will be recruited to join the MMC faculty with joint appointments at Vanderbilt under the auspices of this grant. We propose career development of MMC faculty through formal training programs and training of a minority medical oncologist, minority research nurses and data managers, minority Ph.D. candidates, and MMC medical students in basic and clinical cancer research.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Partnership Program The University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCFCC) and San Francisco State University (SFSU) propose a U56 program that combines research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer, a training program to prepare minority students for highly competitive Ph.D. programs with a focus on cancer research and health disparities., and a recruitment activity that will result in establishment of a biobehavioral research center focused on cancer research at SFSU. Our plan also incorporates community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities within our pilot projects and pilot programs. Our proposal is the result of extensive planning between faculty and administrators at the UCSFCC and SFSU which has taken into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions can complement and strengthen each other's work. The resulting proposed activities were selected to benefit both partners and surrounding community, especially economically disadvantaged neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. A major effort will be direct at increasing the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally underrepresented in biomedical and biobehavioral research, and eliminating health disparities. Faculty and administrators from the UCSFCC and SFSU are committed to this program and will continue to work together to develop a stable cancer research program at SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, and to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the UCSFCC/SFSU partnership and the support of the NCI.

"Building Minority Cancer Research Capacity: NMSU & FHCRC Minorities are more likely to suffer the ill effects of cancer than their white counterparts and few enter the field of cancer research. In response to these disparities, NCI has initiated a Minority Institution (MI)/Cancer Center (CC) Partnership program. The program is directed at building cancer research capacity at the MI and increasing the number of under- represented minorities involved in cancer research. New Mexico State University (NMSU) is a Carnegie Foundation ""Doctoral/Research University-Extensive"" MI with a successful history of training underrepresented and conducting biomedical research. Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC) is an internationally recognized NCI designated cancer center. The partnership between NMSU and FHCRC will provide NMSU formal access to resources and expertise in cancer research. The FHCRC will gain a formal linking with an accomplished NI in order to increase minority presence in its training and research programs. The long term objective of this program is to build cancer research capacity at NMSU and increase minority participation in FHCRC cancer research and education programs. The objectives of this partnership are to: 1) Establish a long-lasting infrastructure to conduct cancer research at NMSU. Components of the infrastructure will include a) a plan for recruiting new and existing NMSU faculty into cancer research; 2) the development of an exchange program for faculty and students between the two institutions; and c) the establishment of a research curriculum t NMSU that will increase knowledge of and skills to address cancer disparities among minority populations. 2.) Develop a structure to recruit, train, train, and mentor undergraduate and graduate minority students for careers in cancer research. Building on existing programs at NMSU, formal links will be established to ensure that such avenues are available for minority students. 3) Provide both NMSU and FHCRC with new research experiences that will benefit scientists at both institutions as well as the populations served by each institution. This will be accomplished initially by conducting 5 pilot projects during the first three years of the grant with others to follow in years 4 and 5.

"PRCC/MDACC: Partners for Excellence in Cancer Research Significant disparities in cancer incidence and outcomes exist among ethnic minority populations. The overall Goal of this U54 Application is to establish a comprehensive long-term mutually beneficial partnership between the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) and the University of Puerto Rico Cancer Center (PRCC). This partnership was initiated three years ago through the support of a supplement to MDACC P30 grant. Specific Objectives of the current proposal include: a) development of independent cancer research investigators through collaborative research projects, and b) establishment of a stable, long-term mutually beneficial collaborative relationship between MDACC and PRCC in the areas of cancer research, training and education. Efforts will be focused on the following areas: 1) Cancer research: the major programs and pilot projects address (a) molecular epidemiology of Head and Neck Cancer, and Breast Cancer, (b) cancer biology related to Breast Cancer, and (c) areas of cancer disparity in minority populations such as Acute Pro-myelocytic Leukemia; 2) Cancer Research training and education programs are described for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral students in areas of Cancer Biology, Outreach, and Epidemiology. PRCC and MDACC will continue the establishment of a comprehensive bi-directional training program that will increase the number of Hispanic students interested in cancers in cancer research. In addition, PRCC faculty will receive research training at MDACC; PRCC faculty will increase sensitivity of MDACC faculty to cultural differences among Hispanic groups, a particularly important benefit as Houston's and Texas's Hispanic population continues to grow. Infrastructure activities will include the frequent use of video conferences, library services support, and establishment of a tissue bank. Outstanding individuals agreed to serve as internal advisors and in the Program Steering Committee. The partnership will enhance the opportunities of both institutions to apply for R01s, SPORES, PO1s and R25 Cancer Education grants with an emphasis on reducing cancer disparities among populations. Finally, one of the major long-range goals of the partnership is for PRCC to regain its status as an NCI-designated Cancer Center.

"MMC and VICC: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC) and the Vanderbilt-lngram Comprehensive Cancer Center (VICC) over the past five years of their formal partnership. The bedrock of this pioneering collaboration has been the U54 from the NCI. Our partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our two institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award has moved our collaborative research program more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. Until recently, MMC viewed itself primarily as a teaching institution and, therefore, did not have a critical mass of researchers in cancer. MMC, with pivotal help from U54 funds, is growing its capacity but has a thriving concentration of cancer researchers in cancer biology, cancer epidemiology and clinical cancer research. The U54 has provided the major impetus for a bold restructuring of the basic science departments at MMC that will assure release time for MMC investigators. The Division of Cancer Biology, headed by Dr. Adunyah, Co-Pi of the U54 at MMC will consist of faculty with 80% release time for research. In cooperation with the U54 Pis, mentoring committees consisting of faculty from MMC and VICC will assist faculty in developing competitive research programs. This restructure was due, in part, to recommendations made by our Program Steering Committee at their 2003 and 2004 meetings. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this second phase of our partnership, we concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC and VICC. In addition to funding research studies, funds will be used to recruit investigators and strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research at MMC. A critical mass of researchers in all these areas will strengthen the quality of MMC/VICC collaborative efforts. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership between MMC and VICC is of immense benefit to the two participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. Our major collaborative successes including the Southern Community Cohort Study of urban and rural African Americans and Caucasians in the mid-South testify to our potential for meeting our goal of eliminating cancer disparities between African Americans and Caucasians.  ",MMC and VICC: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities,7291582,U54CA091405,[''],NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U54,2007,673410,0.05108091688677745
"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research. Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists. The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores: Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core. In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.   ",Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2),7409921,U54CA132383,[''],NCI,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,U54,2007,793132,0.18308771975480712

"PRCC/MDACC: Partners for Excellence in Cancer Research This is a resubmission for The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Partnership for Excellence in Research Grant, which addresses comments and recommendations from the 1) summary statement, 2) NCI Site Visit, and 3) IAC and PSC Committees. Areas strengthened in this application include: leadership, communication, committee oversight, evaluation, career development and mentorship. Funds granted in this award will be used to: 1) support 3 full projects in cancer biology and prevention and 1 pilot project in epidemiology, 2) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations, 3) increase faculty/trainee participation in the training program, 4) expand efforts in our Outreach Program to impact a larger audience, and 5) fortify and stabilize the infrastructure developing at the UPRCCC. Research grants included target 1) developing new cancer imaging techniques, 2) regulating RNA in eukaryotic cells, 3) reducing cancer risk through combined alcohol and tobacco treatment and 4) assessing the role of insulin resistance syndrome as a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The Outreach Program, which was added into the original grant mid-year 3, has been expanded to include cancer related to tobacco, as well as breast, cervical and HPV. The Training Program has also been expanded in scope to impact more faculty and trainees through a comprehensive career development and mentorship training program. The original grant (2002) was awarded to establish a comprehensive long-term mutually beneficial relationship to target and eradicate cancer health disparities. The two short term objectives of the original proposal were met: 1) develop independent cancer research investigators and 2) establish a strong working relationship based on mutual benefit, identified strengths and reciprocity. The 3rd long-term objective of the Partnership is to regain NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Thus far, the Partnership has set the foundation for a dynamic collaboration dedicated to enhancing each partner's strengths and eliminating each partner's weaknesses. The Partnership has also served as the catalyst for two major laws passed in Puerto Rico, one of which resulted in the allocation of funding for establishing the infrastructure and recruiting top notch faculty to the UPRCCC. As of 2008, the Partnership is far from reaching its long-range goal of regaining NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Funding for the U54 resubmission is critical to maintain the momentum of the Partnership's joint efforts in Cancer Research, Training and Outreach. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This resubmission seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPRCCC and MDACC. By addressing the differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership will strive to reduce these differences through efforts in Research, Outreach, and Training. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  The overall theme of our proposal is to reduce the cancer research disparities in the two institutions.  Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research.  This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project.  Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education.  Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC.  Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students.  Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities.  The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change.  NMSU also plans to hire a new faculty investigator.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength.   Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions.  NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research.  A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers.  The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research.  Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists.  The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores:  Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core.  In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.  ",Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2),7410195,U54CA132381,[''],NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U54,2007,1024205,0.1927069701424993
"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Partnership Program The University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCFCC) and San Francisco State University (SFSU) propose a U56 program that combines research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer, a training program to prepare minority students for highly competitive Ph.D. programs with a focus on cancer research and health disparities., and a recruitment activity that will result in establishment of a biobehavioral research center focused on cancer research at SFSU. Our plan also incorporates community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities within our pilot projects and pilot programs. Our proposal is the result of extensive planning between faculty and administrators at the UCSFCC and SFSU which has taken into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions can complement and strengthen each other's work. The resulting proposed activities were selected to benefit both partners and surrounding community, especially economically disadvantaged neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. A major effort will be direct at increasing the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally underrepresented in biomedical and biobehavioral research, and eliminating health disparities. Faculty and administrators from the UCSFCC and SFSU are committed to this program and will continue to work together to develop a stable cancer research program at SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, and to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the UCSFCC/SFSU partnership and the support of the NCI.

"Planning Grant for Bowie State/University of Maryland Cancer Research Training an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer in Maryland, and its impact on the health of minority and underserved rural populations, is a particularly serious health care dilemma. In fact, Maryland now ranks 7th nationally in cancer incidence, and significant disparities are seen between African American and Caucasian populations in stage of diagnosis, access to early detection, cancer screening follow-up, treatment, and health services utilization. The unequal burden of cancer in minority and underserved communities nationally and in Maryland's minority and underserved communities is a compelling crisis that requires intensive scientific, community outreach and translation and application of research. Bowie State University (BSU), a Minority Serving Institution (MSI) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and its Program In Oncology and the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center propose to establish a partnership with the overall goal of reducing and eventually eliminating cancer health disparities experienced by minority populations in Prince George's county and Baltimore City, Maryland by increasing the number of minority scientists pursuing successful cancer research careers and developing effective cancer education programs specifically targeting minority students and faculty, and the community. The specific aims of the BSU-UMSOM partnership are: (1) To collaboratively develop and implement a joint minority cancer research career development training program (""Cancer Research Training Program"") in cancer health disparities research for BSU junior faculty; (2) To collaboratively enhance the science curriculum at BSU through the development, implementation, and evaluation of a cancer health disparities education curriculum (""Undergraduate Cancer Education Program"") to prepare BSU students for mentored undergraduate cancer research training at UMSOM; and (3) To collaboratively develop, implement, and pilot test an enhanced community-based caner outreach education program (""Community Cancer Outreach Education Program"") in price George's County specifically targeting minority, underserved communities (i.e., African Americans). The partnership's objectives blend the existing expertise at the collaborating institutions in the form of high- quality educational programs and a rich source of talent at BSU and the state-of-the-art cancer research, investigator training, and community outreach programs at UMSOM. This partnership is based on prior informal collaborations between members of faculty at BSU and UMSOM. The proposed partnership between BSU and UMSOM will address both community and institutional needs to effectively address cancer health disparities.              ",Planning Grant for Bowie State/University of Maryland Cancer Research Training an,7293618,P20CA119192,"['Educational Curriculum ', ' Curriculum ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Institution ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Address ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' investigator training ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' follow-up ', ' followed up ', ' follow up ', ' Active Follow-up ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' minority health ', ' Screening for cancer ', ' early cancer detection ', ' Cancer Screening for Patients ', ' Incidence ', ' Evaluation ', ' Screening procedure ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Training ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Numbers ', ' health care service utilization ', ' healthcare utilization ', ' healthcare service utilization ', ' health services utilization ', ' Health Care Utilization ', ' Rural ', ' Maryland ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' oncology ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Research ', ' Rural Population ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Science ', ' programs ', ' Arts ', ' Students ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Scientist ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translations ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' Source ', ' Baltimore ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' member ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' County ', ' Price ', ' pricing ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' outreach program ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' clinical investigation ', ' cancer education ', ' Communities ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,P20,2007,162974,0.12666493995259567

"Univ. of Guam/Cancer Res. Center of Hawaii Partnership The University of Guam (UOG) is the only four-year institution of higher learning in the Western Pacific serving the U.S. territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as all of Micronesia. The University offers BS and BA degrees in well over 30 disciplines as well as Master degrees in eight different areas. The student population consists of approximately 50% Pacific Islanders, 32% Filipino, 9% Caucasians, 8% Asians, and 1% other minorities. The University operates several interdisciplinary research programs including marine biology, water and environmental research, Micronesian language and area studies, and Micronesian health and aging studies. The Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (CRCH) is an NCI-designated cancer center at the University of Hawaii. The CRCH is currently the only NCI-designated Cancer Center at a minority-serving institution. There are four research programs established at the CRCH, along with a large clinical trials unit and the Hawaii Tumor Registry. Research efforts at the CRCH take particular advantage of the research opportunities provided in Hawaii which includes the multiethnic population in the State of Hawaii and their vastly different risks of developing cancer at different organ sites. Accordingly, research addressing health disparities in different ethnic groups and minorities along with a particular awareness of cultural sensitivity are major characteristics of the CRCH. CRCH and UOG have a track record of approximately 15 years of successful research cooperation in the area of natural products drug discovery. The two institutions plan to develop their successful research cooperation into a long-term partnership of mutual benefit in the area of cancer research, cancer training and career development, and cancer outreach. This application for a U56 comprehensive planning grant for a Minority Institution/Cancer Center Partnership has the following objectives: a) to increase the cancer research capabilities in a variety of different disciplines at the UOG, b) to increase the number of minority scientists of Pacific Islander ancestry engaged in cancer research or other cancer related activities by providing pertinent undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate training opportunities, c) to provide career development for cancer investigators at the UOG in order to develop and sustain independently funded cancer research programs at the UOG, d) to further strengthen the focus of research, training, and outreach activities at the CRCH on the disproportionate incidence, mortality, and morbidity in minority populations, e) to expand the geographic region of the U.S. served by CRCH to the Territory of Guam, and f) to ultimately reduce the impact of cancer on the population in the Territory of Guam (and possibly other U.S. island territories in the Pacific) by enhancing the awareness of cancer prevention opportunities and improving the quality of care for cancer patients.

"PRCC/MDACC:Partners for Excellence in Cancer Research This is a resubmission for The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Partnership for Excellence in Research Grant, which addresses comments and recommendations from the 1) summary statement, 2) NCI Site Visit, and 3) IAC and PSC Committees. Areas strengthened in this application include: leadership, communication, committee oversight, evaluation, career development and mentorship. Funds granted in this award will be used to: 1) support 3 full projects in cancer biology and prevention and 1 pilot project in epidemiology, 2) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations, 3) increase faculty/trainee participation in the training program, 4) expand efforts in our Outreach Program to impact a larger audience, and 5) fortify and stabilize the infrastructure developing at the UPRCCC. Research grants included target 1) developing new cancer imaging techniques, 2) regulating RNA in eukaryotic cells, 3) reducing cancer risk through combined alcohol and tobacco treatment and 4) assessing the role of insulin resistance syndrome as a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The Outreach Program, which was added into the original grant mid-year 3, has been expanded to include cancer related to tobacco, as well as breast, cervical and HPV. The Training Program has also been expanded in scope to impact more faculty and trainees through a comprehensive career development and mentorship training program. The original grant (2002) was awarded to establish a comprehensive long-term mutually beneficial relationship to target and eradicate cancer health disparities. The two short term objectives of the original proposal were met: 1) develop independent cancer research investigators and 2) establish a strong working relationship based on mutual benefit, identified strengths and reciprocity. The 3rd long-term objective of the Partnership is to regain NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Thus far, the Partnership has set the foundation for a dynamic collaboration dedicated to enhancing each partner's strengths and eliminating each partner's weaknesses. The Partnership has also served as the catalyst for two major laws passed in Puerto Rico, one of which resulted in the allocation of funding for establishing the infrastructure and recruiting top notch faculty to the UPRCCC. As of 2008, the Partnership is far from reaching its long-range goal of regaining NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Funding for the U54 resubmission is critical to maintain the momentum of the Partnership's joint efforts in Cancer Research, Training and Outreach. RELEVANCE (See instructions): This resubmission seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPRCCC and MDACC. By addressing the differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership will strive to reduce these differences through efforts in Research, Outreach, and Training. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive cancer Partnership Program San Francisco State University (SFSU) and the University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSFCC) propose a 56 planning program comprised of two research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer and a training program to encourage and prepare minority nursing students to earn Ph.D. degrees focusing on cancer research and health disparities. It also includes community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities incorporated within the pilot projects and program. One of the major activities of the proposed program is a recruitment activity that will result in the immediate hiring of a senior-level biobehavioral researcher at SFSU and, over the next five years, the hiring of six junior-faculty researchers-all of whom will form the core of a new Biobehavioral Research Center at SFSU.. The President of SFSU has committed $1M to help build-out this new Center, and to allocating ongoing personnel funds for a tenured, senior level professor to fill this position. The proposal is the result of extensive planning among faculty and administrators at SFSU and the UCSFCC who took into careful consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions could complement and strengthen each other's work. Projects, programs, and activities selected for this proposal are those that will mutually benefit both partners and surrounding neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. One such direct benefit will be the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed both increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally under-represented in biomedical and biobehavioral researcher and the elimination of health disparities Faculty and administrators from SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the SFSU/UCSFCC partnership, and to work toward the development of a U-54 program grant.

"Drew/UCLA Cancer Partnership Program SPACE PROVIDED. Charles R. Drew University of Medicine and Science (DREW) a minority institution (MSI/HBCU) located in South Central Los Angeles, is planning a partnership with the world renowned Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA). The proposed partnership with the UCLA-JCCC provides a unique opportunity to begin to strengthen the DREW cancer research and training infrastructure. Conversely, UCLA and the investigators in the JCCC will have the important opportunity to address, in a focused manner, issues related to the unequal burden of cancer in minority populations. This partnership will focus on the areas of cancer research, training, education and outreach, and strengthen the DREW and UCLA research portfolios through programs that develop and enhance the capacity of investigators to perform high quality research with sensitivity toward reducing racial/ethnic disparities in health status. This application describes our plans to establish a comprehensive, seamless program of joint cancer research, training and career development by 1) integrating faculty, fellows, and students into various  cancer training and career development programs; 2) planning and initiating pilot projects; and 3) enhancing research capability of the DREW Tissue Repository. This program will recruit promising students, scientists, and clinicians at DREW and UCLA into the field of cancer research, education and treatment, and to retain these individuals within the combined DREW/UCLA cancer program. At the same time, we will increase the number of minority scientists in cancer research, treatment, education and training. Our training and career development programs will produce outstanding academic and culturally sensitive students, postdoctoral fellows, and faculty. These individuals will serve as our ambassadors toward understanding and therefore, reducing the burden of cancer in our underserved and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. In view of the rapidly changing demographics of Los Angeles and the State of California, the DREW-UCLA Partnership is ideally situated and will have an opportunity to have a positive impact on the cancer incidence and survival in minority and underserved populations.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  The overall theme of our proposal is to reduce the cancer research disparities in the two institutions.  Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research.  This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project.  Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education.  Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC.  Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students.  Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities.  The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change.  NMSU also plans to hire a new faculty investigator.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength.   Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions.  NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research.  A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers.  The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research.  Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists.

"Univ. of Guam/Cancer Res. Center of Hawaii Partnership The University of Guam (UOG) is the only four-year institution of higher learning in the Western Pacific serving the U.S. territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as all of Micronesia. The University offers BS and BA degrees in well over 30 disciplines as well as Master degrees in eight different areas. The student population consists of approximately 50% Pacific Islanders, 32% Filipino, 9% Caucasians, 8% Asians, and 1% other minorities. The University operates several interdisciplinary research programs including marine biology, water and environmental research, Micronesian language and area studies, and Micronesian health and aging studies. The Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (CRCH) is an NCI-designated cancer center at the University of Hawaii. The CRCH is currently the only NCI-designated Cancer Center at a minority-serving institution. There are four research programs established at the CRCH, along with a large clinical trials unit and the Hawaii Tumor Registry. Research efforts at the CRCH take particular advantage of the research opportunities provided in Hawaii which includes the multiethnic population in the State of Hawaii and their vastly different risks of developing cancer at different organ sites. Accordingly, research addressing health disparities in different ethnic groups and minorities along with a particular awareness of cultural sensitivity are major characteristics of the CRCH. CRCH and UOG have a track record of approximately 15 years of successful research cooperation in the area of natural products drug discovery. The two institutions plan to develop their successful research cooperation into a long-term partnership of mutual benefit in the area of cancer research, cancer training and career development, and cancer outreach. This application for a U56 comprehensive planning grant for a Minority Institution/Cancer Center Partnership has the following objectives: a) to increase the cancer research capabilities in a variety of different disciplines at the UOG, b) to increase the number of minority scientists of Pacific Islander ancestry engaged in cancer research or other cancer related activities by providing pertinent undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate training opportunities, c) to provide career development for cancer investigators at the UOG in order to develop and sustain independently funded cancer research programs at the UOG, d) to further strengthen the focus of research, training, and outreach activities at the CRCH on the disproportionate incidence, mortality, and morbidity in minority populations, e) to expand the geographic region of the U.S. served by CRCH to the Territory of Guam, and f) to ultimately reduce the impact of cancer on the population in the Territory of Guam (and possibly other U.S. island territories in the Pacific) by enhancing the awareness of cancer prevention opportunities and improving the quality of care for cancer patients.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive cancer Partnership Program San Francisco State University (SFSU) and the University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCSFCC) propose a 56 planning program comprised of two research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer and a training program to encourage and prepare minority nursing students to earn Ph.D. degrees focusing on cancer research and health disparities. It also includes community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities incorporated within the pilot projects and program. One of the major activities of the proposed program is a recruitment activity that will result in the immediate hiring of a senior-level biobehavioral researcher at SFSU and, over the next five years, the hiring of six junior-faculty researchers-all of whom will form the core of a new Biobehavioral Research Center at SFSU.. The President of SFSU has committed $1M to help build-out this new Center, and to allocating ongoing personnel funds for a tenured, senior level professor to fill this position. The proposal is the result of extensive planning among faculty and administrators at SFSU and the UCSFCC who took into careful consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions could complement and strengthen each other's work. Projects, programs, and activities selected for this proposal are those that will mutually benefit both partners and surrounding neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. One such direct benefit will be the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed both increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally under-represented in biomedical and biobehavioral researcher and the elimination of health disparities Faculty and administrators from SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the SFSU/UCSFCC partnership, and to work toward the development of a U-54 program grant.

During the past year and with funding from the National Cancer Institute, the two institutions have firmly established the Partnership by building on complementary institutional strengths conducting joint planning in the molecular and population sciences, and emphasizing a concrete and feasible ""gateway"" initiative: establishment of an NCCU Cancer Core Laboratory for molecular/genetic analysis in cancer research. The Partnership now proposes to expand its initiatives through an NCI-funded Cooperative Planning Grant (U56) for Comprehensive Minority Institution/Cancer Partnership. In addition to continued efforts in molecular/genetic analysis and the Cancer Core Laboratory, the Partnership will emphasize a series of linked gateway pilot initiatives, accompanied by technology transfer, that lead toward a major collaborative research project (with outreach/health education components) a population-based cohort study of prostate cancer in African-American men. This project will be a major focus of the planned application for a Comprehensive Minority Institution/Cancer Center Partnership (U54 CMI/CCP) grant. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: two pilot research projects (assay development and cohort development); a pilot program in outreach and education; resource and infrastructure enhancement centering on the JLC-BBRI Cancer Core Laboratory; and career development for junior faculty and students. The UNC Lineberger and UNC-Chapel Hill offer the Partnership: 1) extensive experience, expertise, and resources for cancer research and training; and 2) a demonstrated interest in minority health disparities. The JLC-BBRI and NCCU offer the Partnership: 1) experience and expertise in reaching minority populations through culturally appropriate and sensitive interventions; 2) opportunities to access minority populations; and 3) training opportunities for minority students potentially interested in careers in cancer research. These complementary institutional strengths will help the Partnership: 1) establish an effective cancer research infrastructure/program and increase training opportunities at a minority serving institution; and 2) enhance community- and population-based research targeting minority cancer-related health disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI funded Coin comprehensive Cancer Center.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Partnership Program The University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCFCC) and San Francisco State University (SFSU) propose a U56 program that combines research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer, a training program to prepare minority students for highly competitive Ph.D. programs with a focus on cancer research and health disparities., and a recruitment activity that will result in establishment of a biobehavioral research center focused on cancer research at SFSU. Our plan also incorporates community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities within our pilot projects and pilot programs. Our proposal is the result of extensive planning between faculty and administrators at the UCSFCC and SFSU which has taken into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions can complement and strengthen each other's work. The resulting proposed activities were selected to benefit both partners and surrounding community, especially economically disadvantaged neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. A major effort will be direct at increasing the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally underrepresented in biomedical and biobehavioral research, and eliminating health disparities. Faculty and administrators from the UCSFCC and SFSU are committed to this program and will continue to work together to develop a stable cancer research program at SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, and to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the UCSFCC/SFSU partnership and the support of the NCI.

"MMC and VICC: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC) and the Vanderbilt-lngram Comprehensive Cancer Center (VICC) over the past five years of their formal partnership. The bedrock of this pioneering collaboration has been the U54 from the NCI. Our partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our two institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award has moved our collaborative research program more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. Until recently, MMC viewed itself primarily as a teaching institution and, therefore, did not have a critical mass of researchers in cancer. MMC, with pivotal help from U54 funds, is growing its capacity but has a thriving concentration of cancer researchers in cancer biology, cancer epidemiology and clinical cancer research. The U54 has provided the major impetus for a bold restructuring of the basic science departments at MMC that will assure release time for MMC investigators. The Division of Cancer Biology, headed by Dr. Adunyah, Co-Pi of the U54 at MMC will consist of faculty with 80% release time for research. In cooperation with the U54 Pis, mentoring committees consisting of faculty from MMC and VICC will assist faculty in developing competitive research programs. This restructure was due, in part, to recommendations made by our Program Steering Committee at their 2003 and 2004 meetings. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this second phase of our partnership, we concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC and VICC. In addition to funding research studies, funds will be used to recruit investigators and strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research at MMC. A critical mass of researchers in all these areas will strengthen the quality of MMC/VICC collaborative efforts. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership between MMC and VICC is of immense benefit to the two participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. Our major collaborative successes including the Southern Community Cohort Study of urban and rural African Americans and Caucasians in the mid-South testify to our potential for meeting our goal of eliminating cancer disparities between African Americans and Caucasians.  ",MMC and VICC: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities,7496145,U54CA091405,[''],NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U54,2008,708895,0.05108091688677745

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research. Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists. The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores: Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core. In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.   ",Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2),7502054,U54CA132383,[''],NCI,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,U54,2008,1234024,0.18308771975480712

"Planning Grant for Bowie State University/University of Maryland Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer in Maryland, and its impact on the health of minority and underserved rural populations, is a particularly serious health care dilemma. In fact, Maryland now ranks 7th nationally in cancer incidence, and significant disparities are seen between African American and Caucasian populations in stage of diagnosis, access to early detection, cancer screening follow-up, treatment, and health services utilization. The unequal burden of cancer in minority and underserved communities nationally and in Maryland's minority and underserved communities is a compelling crisis that requires intensive scientific, community outreach and translation and application of research. Bowie State University (BSU), a Minority Serving Institution (MSI) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and its Program In Oncology and the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center propose to establish a partnership with the overall goal of reducing and eventually eliminating cancer health disparities experienced by minority populations in Prince George's county and Baltimore City, Maryland by increasing the number of minority scientists pursuing successful cancer research careers and developing effective cancer education programs specifically targeting minority students and faculty, and the community. The specific aims of the BSU-UMSOM partnership are: (1) To collaboratively develop and implement a joint minority cancer research career development training program (""Cancer Research Training Program"") in cancer health disparities research for BSU junior faculty; (2) To collaboratively enhance the science curriculum at BSU through the development, implementation, and evaluation of a cancer health disparities education curriculum (""Undergraduate Cancer Education Program"") to prepare BSU students for mentored undergraduate cancer research training at UMSOM; and (3) To collaboratively develop, implement, and pilot test an enhanced community-based caner outreach education program (""Community Cancer Outreach Education Program"") in price George's County specifically targeting minority, underserved communities (i.e., African Americans). The partnership's objectives blend the existing expertise at the collaborating institutions in the form of high- quality educational programs and a rich source of talent at BSU and the state-of-the-art cancer research, investigator training, and community outreach programs at UMSOM.

The University offers BS and BA degrees in well over 30 disciplines as well as Master degrees in eight different areas. The student population consists of approximately 50% Pacific Islanders, 32% Filipino, 9% Caucasians, 8% Asians, and 1% other minorities. The University operates   several interdisciplinary research programs including marine biology, water and environmental research, Micronesian language and area studies, and Micronesian health and aging studies.      The Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (CRCH) is an NCI-designated cancer center at the University of Hawaii. The CRCH is currently the only NCI-designated Cancer Center at a minority-serving institution. There are four research programs established at the CRCH, along with a large clinical trials unit and the Hawaii Tumor Registry. Research efforts at the CRCH take particular advantage of the research opportunities provided in Hawaii which includes the multiethnic population in the State of Hawaii and their vastly different risks of developing cancer at different organ sites. Accordingly, research addressing health disparities in different ethnic groups and minorities along with a particular awareness of cultural sensitivity are major characteristics of the CRCH.        CRCH and UOG have a track record of approximately 15 years of successful research cooperation in the area of natural products drug discovery. The two institutions plan to develop their successful research cooperation into a long-term partnership of mutual benefit in the area of cancer research, cancer training and career development, and cancer outreach. This application for a U56 comprehensive planning grant for a Minority Institution/Cancer Center Partnership has the following objectives: a) to increase the cancer research capabilities in a variety of different disciplines at the UOG, b) to increase the number of minority scientists of Pacific Islander ancestry engaged in cancer research or other cancer related activities by providing pertinent undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate training opportunities, c) to provide career development for cancer investigators at the UOG in order to develop and sustain independently funded cancer research programs at the UOG, d) to further strengthen the focus of research, training, and outreach activities at the CRCH on the disproportionate incidence, mortality, and morbidity in minority populations by including the Territory of Guam into the region served by the CRCH, and e) to ultimately reduce the impact of cancer on the population in the Territory of Guam (and possibly other U.S. island territories in the Pacific) by enhancing the awareness of cancer prevention opportunities and improving the quality of care for cancer patients.

"Planning Grant for Bowie State/University of Maryland Cancer Research Training an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer in Maryland, and its impact on the health of minority and underserved rural populations, is a particularly serious health care dilemma. In fact, Maryland now ranks 7th nationally in cancer incidence, and significant disparities are seen between African American and Caucasian populations in stage of diagnosis, access to early detection, cancer screening follow-up, treatment, and health services utilization. The unequal burden of cancer in minority and underserved communities nationally and in Maryland's minority and underserved communities is a compelling crisis that requires intensive scientific, community outreach and translation and application of research. Bowie State University (BSU), a Minority Serving Institution (MSI) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and its Program In Oncology and the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center propose to establish a partnership with the overall goal of reducing and eventually eliminating cancer health disparities experienced by minority populations in Prince George's county and Baltimore City, Maryland by increasing the number of minority scientists pursuing successful cancer research careers and developing effective cancer education programs specifically targeting minority students and faculty, and the community. The specific aims of the BSU-UMSOM partnership are: (1) To collaboratively develop and implement a joint minority cancer research career development training program (""Cancer Research Training Program"") in cancer health disparities research for BSU junior faculty; (2) To collaboratively enhance the science curriculum at BSU through the development, implementation, and evaluation of a cancer health disparities education curriculum (""Undergraduate Cancer Education Program"") to prepare BSU students for mentored undergraduate cancer research training at UMSOM; and (3) To collaboratively develop, implement, and pilot test an enhanced community-based caner outreach education program (""Community Cancer Outreach Education Program"") in price George's County specifically targeting minority, underserved communities (i.e., African Americans). The partnership's objectives blend the existing expertise at the collaborating institutions in the form of high- quality educational programs and a rich source of talent at BSU and the state-of-the-art cancer research, investigator training, and community outreach programs at UMSOM.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  The overall theme of our proposal is to reduce the cancer research disparities in the two institutions.  Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research.  This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project.  Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education.  Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC.  Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students.  Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities.  The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change.  NMSU also plans to hire a new faculty investigator.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength.   Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions.  NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research.  A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers.  The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research.  Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists.

"SFSU/UCSF Comprehensive Cancer Partnership Program The University of California Comprehensive Cancer Center (UCFCC) and San Francisco State University (SFSU) propose a U56 program that combines research pilot projects on prostate and breast cancer, a training program to prepare minority students for highly competitive Ph.D. programs with a focus on cancer research and health disparities., and a recruitment activity that will result in establishment of a biobehavioral research center focused on cancer research at SFSU. Our plan also incorporates community outreach and education components as well as minority faculty development activities within our pilot projects and pilot programs. Our proposal is the result of extensive planning between faculty and administrators at the UCSFCC and SFSU which has taken into consideration the strengths and weaknesses of both institutions and the ways in which the institutions can complement and strengthen each other's work. The resulting proposed activities were selected to benefit both partners and surrounding community, especially economically disadvantaged neighborhoods which are poorly served by the health care network. A major effort will be direct at increasing the enrollment of individuals from minority groups into cancer prevention trials. We have assembled an outstanding Program Steering Committee of highly productive researchers who have championed increasing opportunities for individuals traditionally underrepresented in biomedical and biobehavioral research, and eliminating health disparities. Faculty and administrators from the UCSFCC and SFSU are committed to this program and will continue to work together to develop a stable cancer research program at SFSU, to develop closer connections between the UCSFCC and minority communities, and to work with community organizations to develop novel programs which take advantage of the combined resources and strengths of the UCSFCC/SFSU partnership and the support of the NCI.

"MMC and VICC: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC) and the Vanderbilt-lngram Comprehensive Cancer Center (VICC) over the past five years of their formal partnership. The bedrock of this pioneering collaboration has been the U54 from the NCI. Our partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our two institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award has moved our collaborative research program more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. Until recently, MMC viewed itself primarily as a teaching institution and, therefore, did not have a critical mass of researchers in cancer. MMC, with pivotal help from U54 funds, is growing its capacity but has a thriving concentration of cancer researchers in cancer biology, cancer epidemiology and clinical cancer research. The U54 has provided the major impetus for a bold restructuring of the basic science departments at MMC that will assure release time for MMC investigators. The Division of Cancer Biology, headed by Dr. Adunyah, Co-Pi of the U54 at MMC will consist of faculty with 80% release time for research. In cooperation with the U54 Pis, mentoring committees consisting of faculty from MMC and VICC will assist faculty in developing competitive research programs. This restructure was due, in part, to recommendations made by our Program Steering Committee at their 2003 and 2004 meetings. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this second phase of our partnership, we concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC and VICC. In addition to funding research studies, funds will be used to recruit investigators and strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research at MMC. A critical mass of researchers in all these areas will strengthen the quality of MMC/VICC collaborative efforts. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership between MMC and VICC is of immense benefit to the two participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. Our major collaborative successes including the Southern Community Cohort Study of urban and rural African Americans and Caucasians in the mid-South testify to our potential for meeting our goal of eliminating cancer disparities between African Americans and Caucasians.  ",MMC and VICC: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities,7666771,U54CA091405,[''],NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U54,2009,795807,0.05108091688677745

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research. Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists. The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores: Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core. In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.   ",Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2),7933442,U54CA132383,[''],NCI,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,U54,2009,288047,0.18308771975480712
"Planning Grant for Bowie State/University of Maryland Cancer Research Training an    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cancer in Maryland, and its impact on the health of minority and underserved rural populations, is a particularly serious health care dilemma. In fact, Maryland now ranks 7th nationally in cancer incidence, and significant disparities are seen between African American and Caucasian populations in stage of diagnosis, access to early detection, cancer screening follow-up, treatment, and health services utilization. The unequal burden of cancer in minority and underserved communities nationally and in Maryland's minority and underserved communities is a compelling crisis that requires intensive scientific, community outreach and translation and application of research. Bowie State University (BSU), a Minority Serving Institution (MSI) and the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM) and its Program In Oncology and the Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center propose to establish a partnership with the overall goal of reducing and eventually eliminating cancer health disparities experienced by minority populations in Prince George's county and Baltimore City, Maryland by increasing the number of minority scientists pursuing successful cancer research careers and developing effective cancer education programs specifically targeting minority students and faculty, and the community. The specific aims of the BSU-UMSOM partnership are: (1) To collaboratively develop and implement a joint minority cancer research career development training program (""Cancer Research Training Program"") in cancer health disparities research for BSU junior faculty; (2) To collaboratively enhance the science curriculum at BSU through the development, implementation, and evaluation of a cancer health disparities education curriculum (""Undergraduate Cancer Education Program"") to prepare BSU students for mentored undergraduate cancer research training at UMSOM; and (3) To collaboratively develop, implement, and pilot test an enhanced community-based caner outreach education program (""Community Cancer Outreach Education Program"") in price George's County specifically targeting minority, underserved communities (i.e., African Americans). The partnership's objectives blend the existing expertise at the collaborating institutions in the form of high- quality educational programs and a rich source of talent at BSU and the state-of-the-art cancer research, investigator training, and community outreach programs at UMSOM. This partnership is based on prior informal collaborations between members of faculty at BSU and UMSOM.

"Xavier's RCMI Cancer Research Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, Xavier University of Louisiana has embarked on an ambitious, strategic initiative to enhance its research competitiveness in biomedical fields. Our long term goal is to, in the next 5 to 7 years, be seen nationally not only for our eminence in graduating African American science, pre-med and pharmacy students, but also for national prominence in cancer research. Since 2002, in spite of the destruction rendered by Katrina, Xavier has made significant advances toward achieving this goal through the establishment of both the Center for Minority Health Disparities, launched in 2002, and through membership in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium. Xavier researchers have received significant external funding for cancer research from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, National Cancer Institute, and Louisiana Board of Regents, among others. To determine what next steps needed to be taken to build on the above-described progress and take Xavier ""to the next level,"" a comprehensive RCMI planning process was carried out through faculty and staff surveys, focus groups, and forums, with the assistance of a variety of external advisors. As a result, barriers to competitiveness and strategies to overcoming them were identified in such areas as recruiting and retaining research competitive faculty, infrastructural support for biomedical research, and lack of centralized core laboratories with supporting staff. To address these barriers, this proposal requests funding to assist Xavier in: (1) increasing the number and quality of Cancer researchers and providing them with start-up packages, release time, and mentoring opportunities; 2) enhancing the competitiveness of existing research faculty and programs by providing seed funding for developmental projects, enhanced professional development opportunities and increased access to postdoctoral associates and research staff; (3) developing three research instrumentation cores; (4) offering enhanced administrative services to assure research support activities meet faculty needs, and (5) supporting selected pilot projects that will assist investigators who are at the ""cusp"" of becoming fully competitive.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Nationally, and particularly in Louisiana, there are significant disparities between Caucasians and African Americans with regard to Cancer incidence and mortality. African Americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group for most major cancers, making it a major health and human concern.           ",Xavier's RCMI Cancer Research Program,7764335,G12RR026260,[''],NCRR,XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,G12,2009,2138118,0.08767255168907706

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  The overall theme of our proposal is to reduce the cancer research disparities in the two institutions.  Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research.  This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project.  Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education.  Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC.  Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students.  Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities.  The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change.  NMSU also plans to hire a new faculty investigator.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength.   Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions.  NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research.  A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers.  The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research.  Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists.  The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores:  Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core.

The goals of the CSULA/COH Cancer Collaborative are: 1) to increase the participation and capacity of minority students and minority faculty in cancer research, especially as It relates to cancer disparities among minority populations; and 2) to increase our understanding, at the molecular, behavioral and psychosocial levels, of cancer disparities among minority populations. Structurally, the Cancer Collaborative will consist of five components: a) the Administrative Core; b) the Internal Advisory Committee (IAC); c) the Pilot Project Faculty; d) the Laboratory Mentors; and e) the CSULA students. f) The  Administrative Core, which includes the Principal Investigators (PI's), will arrange collaborative activities, complete progress reports and, ultimately, is responsible for the overall fiscal and administrative operations of the Cancer Collaborative. The IAC will advise the PIs on programmatic decisions, review and select pilot project proposals for funding and monitor their progress, review and monitor minority faculty career. Initiating Development plans and approving selection of students into the training program and monitor their progress, The Pilot Project Faculty and the Laboratory Mentors will form collaborations between CSULA and GOH investigators, co-write research proposals, perform research, publish articles, and mentor CSULA students. Minority faculty investigators at CSULA and GOH will develop and complete individualized career development plans that will include co-development and participation in Pilot Projects and that will take advantage of the many cancer-related resources at COH. The Collaborative will also train CSULA students in cancer research and some of these students will be eligible for admission into COH's Graduate School of: Biological School through a CSULA-COH pipeline mechanism to be established. The Collaborative will also increase awareness of researchers and students of minority population cancer disparities through a Distinguished Speaker Series, and promote the transition of Pilot Projects to RO1-level funding. These activities will help to narrow the gap in health care disparities between the underrepresented minority populations and the majority population.           ",CSULA-COH Collaborative to Study Cancer Disparities,7682324,P20CA118775,"['Research Training ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Principal Investigator ', ' Molecular ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Behavioral ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' Task Forces ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Biological ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Laboratories ', ' Los Angeles ', ' Development Plans ', ' Progress Reports ', ' Funding ', ' Mentors ', ' Collaborations ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Proposals ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Schools ', ' programs ', ' Student Selections ', ' Students ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Writing ', ' Awareness ', ' psychosocial ', ' Operative Surgical Procedures ', ' surgery ', ' Surgical Procedure ', ' Surgical Interventions ', ' Surgical ', ' Operative Procedures ', ' California ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Admission activity ', ' Admission ', ' Healthcare ', ' health care ', ' career development ', ' Cities ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' ']",NCI,BECKMAN RESEARCH INSTITUTE/CITY OF HOPE,P20,2009,308107,0.06363781238208407
"Univ. of Guam/Cancer Res. Center of Hawaii Partnership The University of Guam (UOG) is the only four-year institution of higher learning in the Western Pacific serving the U.S. territories of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, as well as all of Micronesia. The University offers BS and BA degrees in well over 30 disciplines as well as Master degrees in eight different areas. The student population consists of approximately 50% Pacific Islanders, 32% Filipino, 9% Caucasians, 8% Asians, and 1% other minorities. The University operates several interdisciplinary research programs including marine biology, water and environmental research, Micronesian language and area studies, and Micronesian health and aging studies. The Cancer Research Center of Hawaii (CRCH) is an NCI-designated cancer center at the University of Hawaii. The CRCH is currently the only NCI-designated Cancer Center at a minority-serving institution. There are four research programs established at the CRCH, along with a large clinical trials unit and the Hawaii Tumor Registry. Research efforts at the CRCH take particular advantage of the research opportunities provided in Hawaii which includes the multiethnic population in the State of Hawaii and their vastly different risks of developing cancer at different organ sites. Accordingly, research addressing health disparities in different ethnic groups and minorities along with a particular awareness of cultural sensitivity are major characteristics of the CRCH. CRCH and UOG have a track record of approximately 15 years of successful research cooperation in the area of natural products drug discovery. The two institutions plan to develop their successful research cooperation into a long-term partnership of mutual benefit in the area of cancer research, cancer training and career development, and cancer outreach. This application for a U56 comprehensive planning grant for a Minority Institution/Cancer Center Partnership has the following objectives: a) to increase the cancer research capabilities in a variety of different disciplines at the UOG, b) to increase the number of minority scientists of Pacific Islander ancestry engaged in cancer research or other cancer related activities by providing pertinent undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate training opportunities, c) to provide career development for cancer investigators at the UOG in order to develop and sustain independently funded cancer research programs at the UOG, d) to further strengthen the focus of research, training, and outreach activities at the CRCH on the disproportionate incidence, mortality, and morbidity in minority populations, e) to expand the geographic region of the U.S. served by CRCH to the Territory of Guam, and f) to ultimately reduce the impact of cancer on the population in the Territory of Guam (and possibly other U.S. island territories in the Pacific) by enhancing the awareness of cancer prevention opportunities and improving the quality of care for cancer patients.

"UTPA - Cancer Center at UTHSCSA Border Partnership (1 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino/Hispanic population is the largest minority in the US and the highest concentration of Latinos is along the US-Mexico Border. To address the specific needs of this population in cancer research and education, a partnership between The University of Texas-Pan American and the Cancer Center at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio is proposed. The goals of this application are to develop research and training partnerships to increase the cancer research base on the US-Mexico border. The projects proposed will not only develop translational research in basic science but also address cancer related health disparities in the Hispanic border population. The specific goals of the application are: 1. to develop and foster cancer research at UTPA; 2. to foster research dedicated towards reducing the cancer burden of the Hispanic population with emphasis on the US-Mexico border, and 3. to increase the number of cancer researchers coming from South Texas. To accomplish these goals, two pilot projects and a training program are proposed. The first pilot project is a basic science project which will take advantage of the expertise at UTPA to synthesize polycyclic aromatic compounds and expertise at UTHSCSA to test these compounds as anticancer agents. The second pilot project is directed toward understanding the attitudes and decision making processes in genetic testing for increased breast cancer risk. The third project is a summer undergraduate program for UTPA students to work in laboratories and to learn about cancer biology with the goal of increasing the number of students from communities in South Texas interested in cancer research. This multidimensional approach will heighten cancer research and education in the Hispanic/Latino population along the Texas border.        ",UTPA - Cancer Center at UTHSCSA Border Partnership (1 of 2),7928253,P20CA138022,[''],NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS RIO GRANDE VALLEY,P20,2010,232487,0.05762862933053658
"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  The overall theme of our proposal is to reduce the cancer research disparities in the two institutions.  Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research.  This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project.  Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education.  Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC.  Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students.  Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities.  The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change.  NMSU also plans to hire a new faculty investigator.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength.   Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions.  NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research.  A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers.  The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research.  Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission for The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Partnership for Excellence in Research Grant, which addresses comments and recommendations from the 1) summary statement, 2) NCI Site Visit, and 3) IAC and PSC Committees. Areas strengthened in this application include: leadership, communication, committee oversight, evaluation, career development and mentorship. Funds granted in this award will be used to: 1) support 3 full projects in cancer biology and prevention and 1 pilot project in epidemiology, 2) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations, 3) increase faculty/trainee participation in the training program, 4) expand efforts in our Outreach Program to impact a larger audience, and 5) fortify and stabilize the infrastructure developing at the UPRCCC. Research grants included target 1) developing new cancer imaging techniques, 2) regulating RNA in eukaryotic cells, 3) reducing cancer risk through combined alcohol and tobacco treatment and 4) assessing the role of insulin resistance syndrome as a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The Outreach Program, which was added into the original grant mid-year 3, has been expanded to include cancer related to tobacco, as well as breast, cervical and HPV. The Training Program has also been expanded in scope to impact more faculty and trainees through a comprehensive career development and mentorship training program. The original grant (2002) was awarded to establish a comprehensive long-term mutually beneficial relationship to target and eradicate cancer health disparities. The two short term objectives of the original application were met: 1) develop independent cancer research investigators and 2) establish a strong working relationship based on mutual benefit, identified strengths and reciprocity. The 3rd long-term objective of the Partnership is to regain NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Thus far, the Partnership has set the foundation for a dynamic collaboration dedicated to enhancing each partner's strengths and eliminating each partner's weaknesses. The Partnership has also served as the catalyst for two major laws passed in Puerto Rico, one of which resulted in the allocation of funding for establishing the infrastructure and recruiting top notch faculty to the UPRCCC. As of 2008, the Partnership is far from reaching its long-range goal of regaining NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Funding for the U54 resubmission is critical to maintain the momentum of the Partnership's joint efforts in Cancer Research, Training and Outreach.             This resubmission seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPRCCC and MDACC. By addressing the differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership will strive to reduce these differences through efforts in Research, Outreach, and Training.

"MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research The American Association for Cancer Research requests renewal of support for the project entitled ?MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research.? The funds provide scholar awards to support the attendance of full-time faculty from Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) at highcaliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multilevel program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of under-representation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. The broad objective of the project is to increase the oncological knowledge base and participation of faculty from Minority-Serving Institutions in cancer research. MSIs encompass Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges & Universities (TCUs). Awardees receive funds for travel, hotel, subsistence, and registration fees in conjunction with their attendance at the AACR Annual Meeting or an AACR Special Conference. Their attendance at the Annual Meeting exposes them to the broad range of ongoing cancer research in basic, translational, and clinical areas, and at the Special Conferences, allows them to participate in those scientific sessions that are especially relevant to their research interests and professional growth. The project also aims to facilitate the MSI Faculty Scholars? professional relationships and networking possibilities with national and international cancer researchers, and to further their careers and enhance their recognition by professional peers through providing the opportunity to present and discuss their own research findings before national audiences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Beyond the direct benefits to Awardees, the program has potentially wider implications for the  health status of the minority population in general, resulting from the formation of a larger pool of  experienced minority basic cancer researchers and clinicians. First, the enhancement of the MSI  faculty member�s research program enriches the experience of the minority students he or she  trains. Second, minority investigators are more likely to explore the issues relating to minority  health disparities, as well as to have a better prospect of recruiting and collaborating with minority  study subjects, and a significant increase in the number and visibility of minority cancer researchers  might serve as an effective antidote to attitudes of distrust on the part of study participants and  help lead to greater trust on the part of minorities in the medical and research establishment.",MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research,8009335,R13CA076526,"['health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' International ', ' Population Sciences ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' AACR ', ' Faculty ', ' Fees ', ' career ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' minority health ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Institutes ', ' Training ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Antidotes ', ' Theriacs ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Science ', ' programs ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Attitude ', ' Work ', ' Award ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Study Subject ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Medical Research ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Minority ', ' tribal college ', ' tribal university ', ' Population ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2010,171296,0.05921557156485684
"CCNY/MSK Cancer Center Partnership, Training and Community Outreach This proposal describes our plans to establish the City College of New York/Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (1154) Partnership for Cancer Research, Training and Community Outreach. We have established five focused objectives for our Partnership. The first objective is to continue to develop programs of translational research in cell biology, immunology, and biomedical engineering.  One full research project and six pilot research projects are included in our application. These projects emphasize this aim. The second objective is to expand and consolidate collaborative programs of multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research in cancer disparities. Of the six pilot projects included, two pilot projects address this objective. Our third objective is to mobilize Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in innovative ways, to define and address cancer disparities at the local level, and to point the way to broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research. Our proposed PCOP will provide an infrastructure to work with community stakeholders to systematically identify and prioritize possible avenues for action.  PCOP will be involved with ""in-reach"" as well as outreach to bring resources to underserved communities.  Our fourth objective is to attract and retain students interested in cancer research, and in particular minority students, through active recruitment, enhanced education and training opportunities, and increased mentorship and support. We are expanding support for the COURT Program to enable systematic recruitment of undergraduate students, expanded course offerings, mentored placements, and career guidance.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission for The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Partnership for Excellence in Research Grant, which addresses comments and recommendations from the 1) summary statement, 2) NCI Site Visit, and 3) IAC and PSC Committees. Areas strengthened in this application include: leadership, communication, committee oversight, evaluation, career development and mentorship. Funds granted in this award will be used to: 1) support 3 full projects in cancer biology and prevention and 1 pilot project in epidemiology, 2) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations, 3) increase faculty/trainee participation in the training program, 4) expand efforts in our Outreach Program to impact a larger audience, and 5) fortify and stabilize the infrastructure developing at the UPRCCC. Research grants included target 1) developing new cancer imaging techniques, 2) regulating RNA in eukaryotic cells, 3) reducing cancer risk through combined alcohol and tobacco treatment and 4) assessing the role of insulin resistance syndrome as a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The Outreach Program, which was added into the original grant mid-year 3, has been expanded to include cancer related to tobacco, as well as breast, cervical and HPV. The Training Program has also been expanded in scope to impact more faculty and trainees through a comprehensive career development and mentorship training program. The original grant (2002) was awarded to establish a comprehensive long-term mutually beneficial relationship to target and eradicate cancer health disparities. The two short term objectives of the original application were met: 1) develop independent cancer research investigators and 2) establish a strong working relationship based on mutual benefit, identified strengths and reciprocity. The 3rd long-term objective of the Partnership is to regain NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Thus far, the Partnership has set the foundation for a dynamic collaboration dedicated to enhancing each partner's strengths and eliminating each partner's weaknesses. The Partnership has also served as the catalyst for two major laws passed in Puerto Rico, one of which resulted in the allocation of funding for establishing the infrastructure and recruiting top notch faculty to the UPRCCC. As of 2008, the Partnership is far from reaching its long-range goal of regaining NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Funding for the U54 resubmission is critical to maintain the momentum of the Partnership's joint efforts in Cancer Research, Training and Outreach.             This resubmission seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPRCCC and MDACC. By addressing the differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership will strive to reduce these differences through efforts in Research, Outreach, and Training.

"Xavier's RCMI Cancer Research Program In the past decade, Xavier University of Louisiana has embarked on an ambitious, strategic initiative to enhance its research competitiveness in biomedical fields. Our long term goal is to, in the next 5 to 7 years, be seen nationally not only for our eminence in graduating African American science, pre-med and pharmacy students, but also for national prominence in cancer research. Since 2002, in spite of the destruction rendered by Katrina, Xavier has made significant advances toward achieving this goal through the establishment of both the Center for Minority Health Disparities, launched in 2002, and through membership in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium. Xavier researchers have received significant external funding for cancer research from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, National Cancer Institute, and Louisiana Board of Regents, among others. To determine what next steps needed to be taken to build on the above-described progress and take Xavier ""to the next level,"" a comprehensive RCMI planning process was carried out through faculty and staff surveys, focus groups, and forums, with the assistance of a variety of external advisors. As a result, barriers to competitiveness and strategies to overcoming them were identified in such areas as recruiting and retaining research competitive faculty, infrastructural support for biomedical research, and lack of centralized core laboratories with supporting staff. To address these barriers, this proposal requests funding to assist Xavier in: (1) increasing the number and quality of Cancer researchers and providing them with start-up packages, release time, and mentoring opportunities; 2) enhancing the competitiveness of existing research faculty and programs by providing seed funding for developmental projects, enhanced professional development opportunities and increased access to postdoctoral associates and research staff; (3) developing three research instrumentation cores; (4) offering enhanced administrative services to assure research support activities meet faculty needs, and (5) supporting selected pilot projects that will assist investigators who are at the ""cusp"" of becoming fully competitive   ",Xavier's RCMI Cancer Research Program,8103611,G12RR026260,[''],NCRR,XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,G12,2010,520000,0.09225634913153385
"Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer The American Association for Cancer Research requests renewal of support for the project entitled ?Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer.? The funds provide scholar awards to support the attendance of young scientists from NIH-recognized minority populations at highcaliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multilevel program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of under-representation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. Predoctoral (graduate and medical) students, clinical and postdoctoral fellows, residents, and junior investigators, who are either engaged in cancer research or have the training and the potential to make contributions in the field, are eligible for the award. It also applies only to minority groups that have been defined by the NCI as being traditionally underrepresented in cancer and biomedical research: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, Hispanic or Latino Americans, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. Awardees receive funds for travel, hotel, subsistence, and registration fees in conjunction with their attendance at the AACR Annual Meeting or an AACR Special Conference. Their attendance at one of these meetings exposes them to the full spectrum of high-quality cancer research being performed nationally and internationally, and buttresses their knowledge base in the cancer field. The project also aims to increase the number of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and biomedical science, to contribute to the research training and networking opportunities of young minority investigators in the cancer field, and to facilitate relationships between young minority scientists and senior investigators in the field, who may function as mentors and thereby contribute to the career development and professional success of young scientists as cancer researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Beyond the direct benefits to Awardees, the program has potentially wider implications for the  health status of the minority population in general, resulting from the formation of a larger pool of  minority cancer researchers and clinicians. This is because a wider pool of researchers will not only  train and inspire the next generations of minority researchers, but also further explore issues  relating to minority health disparities.

"MMC and VICC: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC) and the Vanderbilt-lngram Comprehensive Cancer Center (VICC) over the past five years of their formal partnership.  The bedrock of this pioneering collaboration has been the U54 from the NCI. Our partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our two institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award has moved our collaborative research program more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. Until recently, MMC viewed itself primarily as a teaching institution and, therefore, did not have a critical mass of researchers in cancer. MMC, with pivotal help from U54 funds, is growing its capacity but has a thriving concentration of cancer researchers in cancer biology, cancer epidemiology and clinical cancer research. The U54 has provided the major impetus for a bold restructuring of the basic science departments at MMC that will assure release time for MMC investigators. The Division of Cancer Biology, headed by Dr. Adunyah, Co-Pi of the U54 at MMC will consist of faculty with 80% release time for research.  In cooperation with the U54 Pis, mentoring committees consisting of faculty from MMC and VICC will assist faculty in developing competitive research programs. This restructure was due, in part, to recommendations made by our Program Steering Committee at their 2003 and 2004 meetings. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this second phase of our partnership, we concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC and VICC. In addition to funding research studies, funds will be used to recruit investigators and strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research at MMC. A critical mass of researchers in all these areas will strengthen the quality of MMC/VICC collaborative efforts. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership between MMC and VICC is of immense benefit to the two participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. Our major collaborative successes including the Southern Community Cohort Study of urban and rural African Americans and Caucasians in the mid-South testify to our potential for meeting our goal of eliminating cancer disparities between African Americans and Caucasians.

"Charles Drew University/UCLA Cancer Center Partnership to Eliminate Cancer Health    The proposed partnership between Charles Drew University (CDU) and UCLA Jonsson Cancer Center seeks to ""Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities in Minority and Underserved Populations"". This objective will continue to strengthen the CDU cancer research and training infrastructure by enhancing the participation of minority students, fellows and faculty engaged in Cancer Research, Training, and Cancer Outreach. The partnership will continue to recruit new faculty with career focus in cancer research, education or outreach.  Likewise, UCLA and the investigators in the JCCC will have the important opportunity to address, issues related to the unequal burden of cancer in minority populations. The partnership developed during our U56 funding has made a significant impact on our ability to develop strong pilots and partnership programs. A key new and important addition to our U54 program is the development of strong Cancer Outreach Program and Projects. Thereby, we will train more minority investigators addressing issues in cancer research, education, training and outcome in our communities. In view of the rapidly changing demographics of Los Angeles and the state of California, the CDU-UCLA Partnership is ideally situated and will have an opportunity to have a positive impact on reducing cancer incidence and improving survival in minority and underserved populations. The overarching goals of the CDU-UCLA Cancer Partnership Program are to significantly increase the number of minority scientists in cancer research and to enhance the cancer outreach programs at CDU to address significant disparities in cancer among minority populations. Supported and implemented by an Administrative Core, Planning and Evaluation Core, and Developmental Core, the basic program components are 1) research projects; 2) the mentoring of students and junior investigators; 3) the training seminar series; 4) enhance CDU's integrated clinical and tissue biorepository data base on minority suubjects; 5) enhance community participation; 6) improve our clinical trials resource; and 7) increase faculty recruitment.

"NCCU-LCCC Partnership in Cancer Research (2 of 2) The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) propose to continue an effective, sustainable, and mutually beneficial partnership in Cancer Research that focuses on African-American health disparities. During the U56 funding period, the two institutions have firmly established the Partnership by building on complementary institutional strengths, conducting joint planning in molecular cancer research, populationbased research and training of junior faculty and students. The Partnership now proposes to expand these initiatives through an NCI-funded Cooperative Planning Grant (U54) for Comprehensive Partnerships to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities. Our objectives are: (1) To expand research collaborations among the two institutions; (2) To use research activities in and outside the U54 mechanism to train students and junior/midlevel faculty in multidisciplinary research aimed at reducing cancer disparities; and (3) To expand and consolidate programs of community outreach and education. The strengths of each institution are uniquely positioned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: 3 full projects in basic cancer research, one full and two pilot projects in community outreach, one minority training project, and one shared resource to enhance NCCU infrastructure and the partnership. The extensive expertise, and resources of LCCC In cancer research and cancer education training, the demonstrated interest in minority health disparities and the experience of NCCU in reaching minority populations, faculty and students, are complementary institutional strengths that will help the Partnership: 1) establish an effective cancer research infrastructure/program with ROI-funded researchers; 2) increase training opportunities at a minority serving institution; 3) enhance community- and population-based research targeting cancer-related health disparities at both institutions; and 4) increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  African-Americans suffer a disproportionate share of the cancer burden, with overall cancer mortality rate  averaging one third higher than Caucasian Americans. Furthermore, for cancers such as prostate or cervical  cancer where treatment can be effective, the rates of treatment failure or recurrence are higher in African  Americans. This partnership will help address these health disparities by promoting minority-targeted  research, and by developing the research infrastructure, capacity, and effectiveness of NCCU",NCCU-LCCC Partnership in Cancer Research (2 of 2),8060721,U54CA156733,[''],NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U54,2010,942632,0.13752003078385916
"UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request 5-year renewal of support for our Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) Summer Internship Program which has run remarkably well and achieved the goals stated in our 2003 application. The long-term goal of CaRES is to stimulate UAB medical students and graduate students in Medicine, Public Health, Dentistry, Health Professions and Nursing, to consider careers in cancer research. In the past 5 years CaRES has supported 237 students who undertook 188 cancer research projects based at UAB's Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC). In summers 2010 - 2014 we will recruit 200 students (""CaRES Interns"") to undertake summer cancer internships of 8 to 16 weeks with ""CaRES Preceptors"" drawn from 300 CCC faculty members engaged in over 400 funded research grants in the basic sciences, translation, prevention and control, and clinical care. Our novel and widely applicable web-based approach will allow students to self-match to the CaRES projects best for them, in light of their background and career interests. Minority recruiting, which has been very successful to date, will be enhanced via linkages with the CCC's Morehouse / Tuskegee / UAB Partnership through UAB's Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center. Interns will receive a locally competitive stipend. They will attend the ""CaRES Career Development Seminars"" to stimulate their interest in cancer research careers and to share their research methodology and findings with fellow interns. Supply money is requested to stimulate third-year medical students to undertake their ""Scholarly Activity"" (required by UAB's School of Medicine) with their CaRES Preceptor from their first year. CaRES Interns will submit abstracts of their work for presentation at the CCC's Annual Research Retreat, UAB's Medical Student Research Day, and at regional and national meetings. We will continue to rigorously evaluate all aspects of CaRES via Intern and Preceptor exit questionnaires so that achievements can be documented and further improvements can be made. Longitudinal tracking reveals that 11% of CaRES Alumni who have completed their original degree programs are engaged in cancer research careers and another 30% are pursuing additional academic or professional training that involves cancer patients or cancer activities that could position them for cancer research careers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most medical students plan a career in medical practice, rather than a research career. But many more cancer researchers are needed in order to understand how to prevent cancer and how to cure it. We will pay medical students to do summer research projects with professors from the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, in order to stimulate each medical student to seriously consider a career in cancer research.           Project Narrative Most medical students plan a career in medical practice, rather than a research career.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research. Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists. The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores: Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core. In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.

"Xavier's RCMI Cancer Research Program    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the past decade, Xavier University of Louisiana has embarked on an ambitious, strategic initiative to enhance its research competitiveness in biomedical fields. Our long term goal is to, in the next 5 to 7 years, be seen nationally not only for our eminence in graduating African American science, pre-med and pharmacy students, but also for national prominence in cancer research. Since 2002, in spite of the destruction rendered by Katrina, Xavier has made significant advances toward achieving this goal through the establishment of both the Center for Minority Health Disparities, launched in 2002, and through membership in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium. Xavier researchers have received significant external funding for cancer research from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, National Cancer Institute, and Louisiana Board of Regents, among others. To determine what next steps needed to be taken to build on the above-described progress and take Xavier ""to the next level,"" a comprehensive RCMI planning process was carried out through faculty and staff surveys, focus groups, and forums, with the assistance of a variety of external advisors. As a result, barriers to competitiveness and strategies to overcoming them were identified in such areas as recruiting and retaining research competitive faculty, infrastructural support for biomedical research, and lack of centralized core laboratories with supporting staff. To address these barriers, this proposal requests funding to assist Xavier in: (1) increasing the number and quality of Cancer researchers and providing them with start-up packages, release time, and mentoring opportunities; 2) enhancing the competitiveness of existing research faculty and programs by providing seed funding for developmental projects, enhanced professional development opportunities and increased access to postdoctoral associates and research staff; (3) developing three research instrumentation cores; (4) offering enhanced administrative services to assure research support activities meet faculty needs, and (5) supporting selected pilot projects that will assist investigators who are at the ""cusp"" of becoming fully competitive.       PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE (provided by applicant): Nationally, and particularly in Louisiana, there are significant disparities between Caucasians and African Americans with regard to Cancer incidence and mortality. African Americans have the highest mortality rate of any racial and ethnic group for most major cancers, making it a major health and human concern.           ",Xavier's RCMI Cancer Research Program,7938025,G12RR026260,[''],NCRR,XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,G12,2010,2352940,0.08767255168907706

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research.

"Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership The overall objective of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparifies. This is being achieved through our programs of Cancer Research, Cancer Training, Cancer Education, Cancer Outreach, Bioethics, and Biostatisfics, which are leading to sustained, integrated, organizational changes at the three Institutions. Significant milestones have been reached. At MSM, a Cancer Research Program (CRP) was established In 2007 by developing an organizational framework for the previously disconnected cancer research scientists and teams. The program consists of four sections, Basic Science Research, Community and Epidemiological Research, Clinical Trials Exploratory, and Research Training and Career Development. Thirty faculty members from diverse scientific disciplines are associated with the CRP. In parallel, TU has demonstrated increased capacity to conduct research on cancerhealth disparities by training and garnering a crifical mass of scienfists who focus on reducing and ellminafing these disparifies. In 2005, 7 scientists at TU were involved in some aspect of cancer research, compared to 17 in 2010. With the central teaching mission of Tuskegee, the training of 9 undergraduates and 22 graduate students in cancer research since 2005 demonstrates TU's ability to establish a pipeline of prospective minority investigators who are focusing on cancer research. This growth in health disparity research and education led to the creation, in December 2010, of the Health Disparities Institute for Research and Education (HDIRE) at TU. Dr. Roberta Troy, Co-PI on the U54 Partnership, was appointed as its founding director. The HDIRE has as its mission the eliminafion and/or mitigation of health disparities through research, education, and training, and through advocacy of policies relevant to underserved populations, particularly in the Black Belt region of Alabama. The UAB CCC has similarly expanded its capacity to conduct cancer health disparities research. In the past 5 years, UAB has recruited 6 new faculty members involved in such research. Each of the institutions has had increases in cancer research funding, indicating scientific productivity. At MSM, S8M was secured in 2000 to support cancer research. By 2005, cancer research funding increased to $18M, and, by 2010, to $26M. Similarly, cancer research funding increased at TU, exceeding $6M in 2010. At the UAB CCC, there was an increase in annual funding from $12M in 2005 to $22M by 2010 in its Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program. This increase was mostly related to research on cancer disparities. While the evaluation of each of the cores and programs is detailed in the respective sections, it is appropriate to highlight some of the achievements. The Developmental Research Proaram continues to be strengthened and to produce competitive and productive investigators. Since its inception, 10 pilot projects and 1 full project have been awarded, and ail but one pilot have been or are being successfully conducted. As of December 2010, 17 peer-reviewed publicafions direcfiy related to the goals of U54 have been generated, a remarkable increase from 1 publication in 2008. Addifionally, investigators of this Partnership have published 75 peer-reviewed manuscripts that are directly related to cancer disparifies (see Appendix A-C). Over the past 5 years, the Cancer Trainina Proqram has trained 81 scholars (28 junior faculty and 53 graduate students) to perform cancer-related research. While 61% of the scholars have extramural funding, 21% have secured additional extramural funding since complefing the program.), and 43% of them have published manuscripts. The Cancer Education Proaram, which is essential for ensuring a pipeline of well-trained students who elect to pursue research in cancer health disparities and related professions, has developed a cancer-related course (Foundations of Cancer Biology) that has been incorporated and sustained as part of the TU curriculum. Recenfiy, Cancer Education Co-Leaders and Bioethics Shared Resource members of the Partnership have developed and offered a Health Disparifies, Bioethics, and Policy course at TU. The Cancer Outreach Programs, based on the community health advisor model, have achieved their medium-term outcomes. Through a relationship with the Department of Public Health, the MSM program disseminated an intervenfion for colon cancer screening in the greater Afianta area. UAB's Cancer Outreach Program increased participation of African Americans in cancer therapeutic trials, with 180 referrals to the program and 124 cancer survivors enrolling in their IMPACT program. At TU, outreach efforts led to a program addressing healthy lifestyles among rural residents, with participants increasing physical activity and making improved dietary choices. Bioethics acfivities continue to be highly rated within the Partnership and by other collaborators. As essential resources, Biostatistics and Bioethics are integrated throughout the Partnership. In summary, consistent with the outcomes oufiined in our Evaluafion Framework developed for the previous applicafion, our tripartite Partnership has achieved short and medium-term outcomes and is now realizing long-term outcomes, including integrated, organizational changes at each of the institutions. These will lead to high-quality research on cancer health disparities, produce well-trained invesfigators, and reduce cancer disparities.

"MMC, VICC & TSU:  Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 2 of 3) Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC), Tennessee State University (TSU) and Vanderbilt-lngram Cancer Center (VICC) resulting in this formal Cancer Partnership. Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants of the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU:  Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 2 of 3)",8210106,U54CA163072,[''],NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U54,2011,1066141,0.1388553331135533
"NCCU-LCCC Partrnership in Cancer Research (1 of 2) The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) propose to continue an effective, sustainable, and mutually beneficial partnership in Cancer Research that focuses on African-American health disparities. During the past eight years and with funding from the NCI, the two institutions have firmly established the Partnership by building on complementary instituflonal strengths, conducting joint planning in molecular cancer research, population-based research and training of junior faculty and students. The Partnership now proposes to expand these iniflaflves through an NCI-funded Cooperative Planning Grant (U54) for Comprehensive Partnerships to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities. Our objecflves are: (1) To expand research collaborations among the two institutions; (2) To use research activities in and outside the U54 mechanism to train students and junior/mid-level faculty in mulfldisciplinary research aimed at reducing cancer disparities; and (3) To expand and consolidate programs of community outreach and education. The strengths of each institution are uniquely posifloned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: 3 full projects in basic cancer research, one full and two pilot projects in community outreach, one minority training project, and one shared resource to enhance NCCU infrastructure and the partnership. The extensive expertise, and resources of LCCC in cancer research and cancer education training, the demonstrated interest in minority health disparities and the experience of NCCU in reaching minority populaflons, faculty and students, are complementary institutional strengths that will help the Partnership: 1) establish an effective cancer research infrastructure/program and increase training opportunities at a minority serving institution; and 2) enhance community- and populaflon-based research targeting minority cancer-related health disparities and increase training ef minority scienflsts at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  African-Americans suffer a disproportionate share ofthe cancer burden, with overall cancer mortality rate  averaging one third higher than Caucasian Americans. Furthermore, for cancers such as prostate or cervical  cancer where treatment can be effective, the rates of treatment failure or recurrence are higher in African  Americans.

"Xavier's RCMI Cancer Research Program In the past decade, Xavier University of Louisiana has embarked on an ambitious, strategic initiative to enhance its research competitiveness in biomedical fields. Our long term goal is to, in the next 5 to 7 years, be seen nationally not only for our eminence in graduating African American science, pre-med and pharmacy students, but also for national prominence in cancer research. Since 2002, in spite of the destruction rendered by Katrina, Xavier has made significant advances toward achieving this goal through the establishment of both the Center for Minority Health Disparities, launched in 2002, and through membership in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium. Xavier researchers have received significant external funding for cancer research from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, National Cancer Institute, and Louisiana Board of Regents, among others. To determine what next steps needed to be taken to build on the above-described progress and take Xavier ""to the next level,"" a comprehensive RCMI planning process was carried out through faculty and staff surveys, focus groups, and forums, with the assistance of a variety of external advisors. As a result, barriers to competitiveness and strategies to overcoming them were identified in such areas as recruiting and retaining research competitive faculty, infrastructural support for biomedical research, and lack of centralized core laboratories with supporting staff. To address these barriers, this proposal requests funding to assist Xavier in: (1) increasing the number and quality of Cancer researchers and providing them with start-up packages, release time, and mentoring opportunities; 2) enhancing the competitiveness of existing research faculty and programs by providing seed funding for developmental projects, enhanced professional development opportunities and increased access to postdoctoral associates and research staff; (3) developing three research instrumentation cores; (4) offering enhanced administrative services to assure research support activities meet faculty needs, and (5) supporting selected pilot projects that will assist investigators who are at the ""cusp"" of becoming fully competitive. Nationally, and particularly in Louisiana, there are significant disparities between Caucasians and African Americans with regard to Cancer incidence and mortality.

"UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request 5-year renewal of support for our Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) Summer Internship Program which has run remarkably well and achieved the goals stated in our 2003 application. The long-term goal of CaRES is to stimulate UAB medical students and graduate students in Medicine, Public Health, Dentistry, Health Professions and Nursing, to consider careers in cancer research. In the past 5 years CaRES has supported 237 students who undertook 188 cancer research projects based at UAB's Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC). In summers 2010 - 2014 we will recruit 200 students (""CaRES Interns"") to undertake summer cancer internships of 8 to 16 weeks with ""CaRES Preceptors"" drawn from 300 CCC faculty members engaged in over 400 funded research grants in the basic sciences, translation, prevention and control, and clinical care. Our novel and widely applicable web-based approach will allow students to self-match to the CaRES projects best for them, in light of their background and career interests. Minority recruiting, which has been very successful to date, will be enhanced via linkages with the CCC's Morehouse / Tuskegee / UAB Partnership through UAB's Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center. Interns will receive a locally competitive stipend. They will attend the ""CaRES Career Development Seminars"" to stimulate their interest in cancer research careers and to share their research methodology and findings with fellow interns. Supply money is requested to stimulate third-year medical students to undertake their ""Scholarly Activity"" (required by UAB's School of Medicine) with their CaRES Preceptor from their first year. CaRES Interns will submit abstracts of their work for presentation at the CCC's Annual Research Retreat, UAB's Medical Student Research Day, and at regional and national meetings. We will continue to rigorously evaluate all aspects of CaRES via Intern and Preceptor exit questionnaires so that achievements can be documented and further improvements can be made. Longitudinal tracking reveals that 11% of CaRES Alumni who have completed their original degree programs are engaged in cancer research careers and another 30% are pursuing additional academic or professional training that involves cancer patients or cancer activities that could position them for cancer research careers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most medical students plan a career in medical practice, rather than a research career.

"UTPA - Cancer Center at UTHSCSA Border Partnership (2 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino/Hispanic population is the largest minority in the US and the highest concentration of Latinos is along the US-Mexico Border. To address the specific needs of this population in cancer research and education, a partnership between The University of Texas-Pan American and the Cancer Center at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio is proposed. The goals of this proposal are to develop research and training partnerships to increase the cancer research base on the US-Mexico border. The projects proposed will not only develop translational research in basic science but also address cancer related health disparities in the Hispanic border population. The specific goals of the application are: 1. To develop and foster cancer research at UTPA; 2. To foster research dedicated towards reducing the cancer burden of the Hispanic population with emphasis on the US-Mexico border, and 3. To increase the number of cancer researchers coming from South Texas. To accomplish these goals, two pilot projects and a training program are proposed. The first pilot project is a basic science project which will take advantage of the expertise at UTPA to synthesize polycyclic aromatic compounds and expertise at UTHSCSA to test these compounds as anticancer agents.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  The overall theme of our proposal is to reduce the cancer research disparities in the two institutions.  Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research.  This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project.  Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education.  Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC.  Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students.  Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities.  The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change.  NMSU also plans to hire a new faculty investigator.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength.   Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions.

Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US.

"Medical Student Summer Program in Integrative Science and Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic minorities and underserved populations suffer a disproportionate burden of cancer related morbidity and mortality. Minority investigators may be an important resource to address this disparity, however, there are few highly trained minority cancer researchers equipped to focus on this concern. One strategy to correct this shortage is to mentor undergraduate minority medical students in order to encourage them to pursue careers as cancer researchers. While Meharry Medical College (MMC) is a minority-serving institution whose curriculum has been oriented to primary care, in the last decade it has also focused on training academic research oriented physician scientists. As a result, the NCI awarded a U-54 Partnership Grant to MMC and the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) which was successfully renewed in 2006. MMC also received a Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MCCOP) grant in 2004 which was renewed in 2006. Both of these grants are concentrated on cancer basic science, translational and clinical research and will be used to augment teaching and research opportunities provided by this application. This competing renewal proposal continues our goal of significantly increasing the number of minority medical students who develop and maintain an interest in pursuing a career in cancer research by providing a meaningful short-term cancer research experience in a research intensive environment.             The specific aims are to:    1. Identify and select first year medical students who have expressed a strong research interest in the biomedical, clinical, or epidemiologic aspects of cancer at a minority serving institution, and whose academic records are strong.   2. Match medical students with experienced cancer researchers in an area of shared interest of the students.    3. Facilitate and enhance this short-term research exposure of medical students and cancer researchers by     3.1 providing weekly interactions with Meharry Medical College faculty involved in cancer research to  reinforce the concepts of hypothesis-testing, selecting the optimal experimental strategies, analyzing and  interpreting data and integrating data across the spectrum of research strategies, and   3.2 providing a weekly luncheon where project summaries and data updates are provided in a nurturing  environment.   4. Provide a venue for the dissemination of student research findings among student peers and cancer researchers at the conclusion of the summer and the following spring, in an institution-wide program.    5. Advise and mentor the selected students through the residency match selection process to encourage their identification of research-linked residencies.    6. Track the selected students through residency training and ultimate career choice.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Ethnic/racial minority populations suffer a disproportionate burden of cancer. Although underrepresented minority investigators would be an important resource to help eliminate this disparity, few are highly trained in this field.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission for The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Partnership for Excellence in Research Grant, which addresses comments and recommendations from the 1) summary statement, 2) NCI Site Visit, and 3) IAC and PSC Committees. Areas strengthened in this application include: leadership, communication, committee oversight, evaluation, career development and mentorship. Funds granted in this award will be used to: 1) support 3 full projects in cancer biology and prevention and 1 pilot project in epidemiology, 2) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations, 3) increase faculty/trainee participation in the training program, 4) expand efforts in our Outreach Program to impact a larger audience, and 5) fortify and stabilize the infrastructure developing at the UPRCCC. Research grants included target 1) developing new cancer imaging techniques, 2) regulating RNA in eukaryotic cells, 3) reducing cancer risk through combined alcohol and tobacco treatment and 4) assessing the role of insulin resistance syndrome as a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The Outreach Program, which was added into the original grant mid-year 3, has been expanded to include cancer related to tobacco, as well as breast, cervical and HPV. The Training Program has also been expanded in scope to impact more faculty and trainees through a comprehensive career development and mentorship training program. The original grant (2002) was awarded to establish a comprehensive long-term mutually beneficial relationship to target and eradicate cancer health disparities. The two short term objectives of the original application were met: 1) develop independent cancer research investigators and 2) establish a strong working relationship based on mutual benefit, identified strengths and reciprocity. The 3rd long-term objective of the Partnership is to regain NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Thus far, the Partnership has set the foundation for a dynamic collaboration dedicated to enhancing each partner's strengths and eliminating each partner's weaknesses. The Partnership has also served as the catalyst for two major laws passed in Puerto Rico, one of which resulted in the allocation of funding for establishing the infrastructure and recruiting top notch faculty to the UPRCCC. As of 2008, the Partnership is far from reaching its long-range goal of regaining NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Funding for the U54 resubmission is critical to maintain the momentum of the Partnership's joint efforts in Cancer Research, Training and Outreach.             This resubmission seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPRCCC and MDACC. By addressing the differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership will strive to reduce these differences through efforts in Research, Outreach, and Training. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.",UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research,8323604,U54CA096297,"['Outreach Research ', ' National Cancer Program ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Published Comment ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' catalyst ', ' Tobacco ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Fostering ', ' base ', ' Training Programs ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Faculty ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Mortality ', ' Recommendation ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Epidemiology ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Site Visit ', ' Cervical ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Prevalence ', ' Address ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' meetings ', ' Training ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Award ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Work ', ' Research Training ', ' RNA ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' Goals ', ' cancer risk ', ' Communication ', ' Leadership ', ' outreach program ', ' Evaluation ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Collaborations ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Grant ', ' Foundations ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Universities ', ' Syndrome ', ' Alcohols ', ' Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' notch protein ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Laws ', ' Joints ', ' Articulation ', ' Breast ', ' Mentorship ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Area ', ' Funding ', ' career development ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Incidence ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,U54,2011,201528,0.07590812939638289
"UTPA - Cancer Center at UTHSCSA Border Partnership (1 of 2)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Latino/Hispanic population is the largest minority in the US and the highest concentration of Latinos is along the US-Mexico Border. To address the specific needs of this population in cancer research and education, a partnership between The University of Texas-Pan American and the Cancer Center at The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio is proposed. The goals of this application are to develop research and training partnerships to increase the cancer research base on the US-Mexico border. The projects proposed will not only develop translational research in basic science but also address cancer related health disparities in the Hispanic border population. The specific goals of the application are: 1. to develop and foster cancer research at UTPA; 2. to foster research dedicated towards reducing the cancer burden of the Hispanic population with emphasis on the US-Mexico border, and 3. to increase the number of cancer researchers coming from South Texas. To accomplish these goals, two pilot projects and a training program are proposed. The first pilot project is a basic science project which will take advantage of the expertise at UTPA to synthesize polycyclic aromatic compounds and expertise at UTHSCSA to test these compounds as anticancer agents. The second pilot project is directed toward understanding the attitudes and decision making processes in genetic testing for increased breast cancer risk. The third project is a summer undergraduate program for UTPA students to work in laboratories and to learn about cancer biology with the goal of increasing the number of students from communities in South Texas interested in cancer research.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research. Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists. The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores: Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core.

"Morehouse School of Med/Tuskegee U/UAB Comp. Cancer Center Partnership    PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): This application is for continuation of the existing partnership between Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC). The three institutions, each serving a community with major black-white racial disparities, possess unique sets of strengths that complement each other. The primary objectives are to maintain progress in establishment of effective cancer research programs at MSM and TU and to persist In developing a pipeline of prospective minority Investigators at TU. The Partnership, with four effective Research Programs In education, research, career progression, and cancer outreach, will continue: 1) to tap the pool of talented students and faculty currently at MSM and TU through an effective Research Training and Career Development (RTCD) Program, linking them to established investigators and to the research Infrastructure at the UABCCC; 2) to promote a Developmental Research Program, which provides funding opportunities to conduct research projects in parallel to the RTCD Program; 3) to encourage postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates across scientific disciplines to pursue careers in the biosciences through our Cancer Education Program and to provide a pipeline into our RTCD and Developmental Research Programs; and, 4) through our established Community Outreach (now Cancer Outreach) Program, to promote cancer screening and healthy lifestyles among our most underserved populations and increase minority participation in therapeutic clinical trials. The partnership has two Interactive Shared Resources: 1) The Bioethics Shared Resource promotes and ensures adherence to bioethical principles and addresses ethical considerations in relationships between majority and minority institutions and between institutions and underserved communities; and 2) The Biostatistics Shared Resource maintains statistical support to all programs ofthe Partnership. With continued accomplishments, this partnership will provide the UABCCC, MSM, and TU with an enhanced capability to conduct research on cancer health disparities. This project will address the disparity in cancer incidence and mortality between African Americans and other racial/ethnic groups.

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC), Tennessee State University (TSU) and Vanderbilt-lngram Cancer Center (VICC) resulting in this formal Cancer Partnership. Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center.             RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants ofthe disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research  infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)",8210077,U54CA163066,[''],NCI,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2011,537968,0.1371329293323763

"Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer The American Association for Cancer Research requests renewal of support for the project entitled ?Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer.? The funds provide scholar awards to support the attendance of young scientists from NIH-recognized minority populations at highcaliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multilevel program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of under-representation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. Predoctoral (graduate and medical) students, clinical and postdoctoral fellows, residents, and junior investigators, who are either engaged in cancer research or have the training and the potential to make contributions in the field, are eligible for the award. It also applies only to minority groups that have been defined by the NCI as being traditionally underrepresented in cancer and biomedical research: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, Hispanic or Latino Americans, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. Awardees receive funds for travel, hotel, subsistence, and registration fees in conjunction with their attendance at the AACR Annual Meeting or an AACR Special Conference. Their attendance at one of these meetings exposes them to the full spectrum of high-quality cancer research being performed nationally and internationally, and buttresses their knowledge base in the cancer field. The project also aims to increase the number of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and biomedical science, to contribute to the research training and networking opportunities of young minority investigators in the cancer field, and to facilitate relationships between young minority scientists and senior investigators in the field, who may function as mentors and thereby contribute to the career development and professional success of young scientists as cancer researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Beyond the direct benefits to Awardees, the program has potentially wider implications for the  health status of the minority population in general, resulting from the formation of a larger pool of  minority cancer researchers and clinicians. This is because a wider pool of researchers will not only  train and inspire the next generations of minority researchers, but also further explore issues  relating to minority health disparities. In addition, Minority researchers have a better prospect of  recruiting and collaborating with minority study subjects, and a significant increase in the number  and visibility of minority cancer researchers might serve as an effective antidote to attitudes of  distrust on the part of study participants and help lead to greater trust on the part of minorities in  the medical and research establishment.",Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer,8145703,R13CA040577,"['Trust ', ' Alaska Native ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Attitude ', ' Travel ', ' next generation ', ' Study Subject ', ' health disparity ', ' health disparities ', ' career development ', ' American ', ' Research Training ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' Medical Students ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' Health Status ', ' Level of Health ', ' Latino ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' Medical Research ', ' Training and Education ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' Funding ', ' symposium ', ' conference ', ' Science ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Award ', ' Clinical ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' programs ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Population ', ' Work ', ' public health relevance ', ' Mentors ', ' Institutes ', ' Hispanics ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Scientist ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' success ', ' Address ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' meetings ', ' Physicians ', ' Minority ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Participant ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Training ', ' Antidotes ', ' Theriacs ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' AACR ', ' Native Americans ', ' Fees ', ' minority health ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2011,216659,0.09704068202503162

"Development of a system (devices and protocols) to improve biospecimen preservati    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Normal and disease tissue biospecimens likely contain all the molecular information required to define disease prognosis and guide treatment. This has been reduced to practice in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer, evidenced by the commercial success of the Mamaprint(R) genomic test (Agendia, Inc; based on estrogen and progesterone sensitivity biomarkers). However, it is recognized that power and utility of today's exquisitely sensitive analytical tools is limited by the quality of the biomarkers measured. Biomarker pre- analytical variability resulting from improper and inconsistent biospecimen acquisition, fixation and shipment can affect the results of molecular analysis and therefore cancer research and therapeutic decisions. Recognizing this, Core Prognostics, Inc. (CPX) developed a unique system (device and protocols) to greatly enhance the convenience, success rate, and reproducibility of biospecimen acquisition and shipping. This passively-cooled system is laboratory-validated and has a proven track record of performance in biomarker- based multi-center clinical trials including three sponsored by NCI cooperative groups. However, as experience has been gained with the system, opportunities for improvement have been defined. Specifically, the experience of CPX shows that a passively-cooled system is inherently unable to guarantee tissue sample quality when simultaneously shipping multiple temperature specimens under different environmental conditions and when operated by technicians with varying experience levels. The specific aim of this project is to create a reusable actively-cooled system to conveniently and reproducibly refrigerate multiple tissue samples to <-700C, 40C and 150C and precisely maintain temperatures during shipment. The research strategy is to expand existing CPX technology partnerships to access the expertise required to achieve the considerable thermodynamic, refrigeration, design, fabrication, hardware and software innovation and laboratory testing necessary to achieve the goals of this proposal. ""Off- the-shelf"" components will be utilized to the greatest extent possible, to take advantage of existing technology, reduce project time and expense as well as the anticipated cost of the final product. The practical benefits of a successful project to improve biospecimen cryopreservation and shipping from patient to analytical laboratory will be to: 1.) substantially increase the reliability and reproducibility of biospecimen preservation and shipping; 2.) create broader access to the collection of a wide range of tissue types; 3.) improve the convenience and flexibility of tissue acquisition; and, 4.) reduce the cost and environmental impact over current single-use solutions. In the long-term, these benefits support the mission of NCI OBBR: ""to guide, coordinate, and develop the Institute's biospecimen resources and capabilities and ensure that human biospecimens available for cancer research are of the highest quality""1 1.

The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center.             RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants ofthe disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research  infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)",8337738,U54CA163066,"['Age ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chemistry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' nanotech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' nano scale Science ', ' Nanoscale Science ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2012,792228,0.1371329293323763
"NCCU-LCCC Partrnership in Cancer Research (1 of 2) The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at  the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) propose to continue an effective, sustainable, and  mutually beneficial partnership in Cancer Research that focuses on African-American health disparities.  During the past eight years and with funding from the NCI, the two institutions have firmly established the  Partnership by building on complementary instituflonal strengths, conducting joint planning in molecular  cancer research, population-based research and training of junior faculty and students. The Partnership now  proposes to expand these iniflaflves through an NCI-funded Cooperative Planning Grant (U54) for  Comprehensive Partnerships to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities. Our objecflves are: (1) To expand  research collaborations among the two institutions; (2) To use research activities in and outside the U54  mechanism to train students and junior/mid-level faculty in mulfldisciplinary research aimed at reducing  cancer disparities; and (3) To expand and consolidate programs of community outreach and education. The  strengths of each institution are uniquely posifloned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to  achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: 3 full projects in basic  cancer research, one full and two pilot projects in community outreach, one minority training project, and one  shared resource to enhance NCCU infrastructure and the partnership. The extensive expertise, and  resources of LCCC in cancer research and cancer education training, the demonstrated interest in minority  health disparities and the experience of NCCU in reaching minority populaflons, faculty and students, are  complementary institutional strengths that will help the Partnership: 1) establish an effective cancer research  infrastructure/program and increase training opportunities at a minority serving institution; and 2) enhance  community- and populaflon-based research targeting minority cancer-related health disparities and increase  training ef minority scienflsts at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  African-Americans suffer a disproportionate share ofthe cancer burden, with overall cancer mortality rate  averaging one third higher than Caucasian Americans. Furthermore, for cancers such as prostate or cervical  cancer where treatment can be effective, the rates of treatment failure or recurrence are higher in African  Americans. This partnership will help address these health disparities by promoflng minority-targeted  research, and by developing the research infrastructure, capacity, and effectiveness of NCUU.",NCCU-LCCC Partrnership in Cancer Research (1 of 2),8332132,U54CA156735,"['neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North Carolina ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Basic Cancer Research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Lineberger Cancer Center ', ' UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Molecular ', ' minority health ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' ']",NCI,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,U54,2012,1341905,0.13479064320328757
"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  The overall theme of our proposal is to reduce the cancer research disparities in the two institutions.  Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research.  This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project.  Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education.  Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC.  Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students.  Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities.  The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change.  NMSU also plans to hire a new faculty investigator.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength.   Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions.  NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research.  A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers.  The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research.  Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists.  The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores:  Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core.  In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission for The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Partnership for Excellence in Research Grant, which addresses comments and recommendations from the 1) summary statement, 2) NCI Site Visit, and 3) IAC and PSC Committees. Areas strengthened in this application include: leadership, communication, committee oversight, evaluation, career development and mentorship. Funds granted in this award will be used to: 1) support 3 full projects in cancer biology and prevention and 1 pilot project in epidemiology, 2) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations, 3) increase faculty/trainee participation in the training program, 4) expand efforts in our Outreach Program to impact a larger audience, and 5) fortify and stabilize the infrastructure developing at the UPRCCC. Research grants included target 1) developing new cancer imaging techniques, 2) regulating RNA in eukaryotic cells, 3) reducing cancer risk through combined alcohol and tobacco treatment and 4) assessing the role of insulin resistance syndrome as a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The Outreach Program, which was added into the original grant mid-year 3, has been expanded to include cancer related to tobacco, as well as breast, cervical and HPV. The Training Program has also been expanded in scope to impact more faculty and trainees through a comprehensive career development and mentorship training program. The original grant (2002) was awarded to establish a comprehensive long-term mutually beneficial relationship to target and eradicate cancer health disparities. The two short term objectives of the original application were met: 1) develop independent cancer research investigators and 2) establish a strong working relationship based on mutual benefit, identified strengths and reciprocity. The 3rd long-term objective of the Partnership is to regain NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Thus far, the Partnership has set the foundation for a dynamic collaboration dedicated to enhancing each partner's strengths and eliminating each partner's weaknesses. The Partnership has also served as the catalyst for two major laws passed in Puerto Rico, one of which resulted in the allocation of funding for establishing the infrastructure and recruiting top notch faculty to the UPRCCC. As of 2008, the Partnership is far from reaching its long-range goal of regaining NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Funding for the U54 resubmission is critical to maintain the momentum of the Partnership's joint efforts in Cancer Research, Training and Outreach.             This resubmission seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPRCCC and MDACC. By addressing the differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership will strive to reduce these differences through efforts in Research, Outreach, and Training. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.",UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research,8327537,U54CA096297,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Award ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laws ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Syndrome ', ' Tobacco ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' notch protein ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' National Cancer Program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Site Visit ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,U54,2012,1679075,0.07590812939638289

"Xavier's RCMI Cancer Research Program In the past decade, Xavier University of Louisiana has embarked on an ambitious, strategic initiative to enhance its research competitiveness in biomedical fields. Our long term goal is to, in the next 5 to 7 years, be seen nationally not only for our eminence in graduating African American science, pre-med and pharmacy students, but also for national prominence in cancer research. Since 2002, in spite of the destruction rendered by Katrina, Xavier has made significant advances toward achieving this goal through the establishment of both the Center for Minority Health Disparities, launched in 2002, and through membership in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium. Xavier researchers have received significant external funding for cancer research from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, National Cancer Institute, and Louisiana Board of Regents, among others. To determine what next steps needed to be taken to build on the above-described progress and take Xavier ""to the next level,"" a comprehensive RCMI planning process was carried out through faculty and staff surveys, focus groups, and forums, with the assistance of a variety of external advisors. As a result, barriers to competitiveness and strategies to overcoming them were identified in such areas as recruiting and retaining research competitive faculty, infrastructural support for biomedical research, and lack of centralized core laboratories with supporting staff. To address these barriers, this proposal requests funding to assist Xavier in: (1) increasing the number and quality of Cancer researchers and providing them with start-up packages, release time, and mentoring opportunities; 2) enhancing the competitiveness of existing research faculty and programs by providing seed funding for developmental projects, enhanced professional development opportunities and increased access to postdoctoral associates and research staff; (3) developing three research instrumentation cores; (4) offering enhanced administrative services to assure research support activities meet faculty needs, and (5) supporting selected pilot projects that will assist investigators who are at the ""cusp"" of becoming fully competitive. Nationally, and particularly in Louisiana, there are significant disparities between Caucasians and African Americans with regard to Cancer incidence and mortality.

"Fresno State-SBCC Partnership: Cancer Research & Training for Central PA (1 of 2) California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) has established a partnership with the NCl-designated Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute (SBMRI) Cancer Center and is applying for a P20 feasibility grant. The goals of the partnership are: a) enhance cancer research potential at Fresno State (a minority serving institution), b) train cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students for future cancer research careers, and c) track students to evaluate program progress. The partnership will combine strengths of both institutions in offering cancer biology education, research, and training in the Fresno State curricula. It will facilitate an intensive exposure of Fresno State students to world-class SBMRI faculty, graduate and postdoctoral resources by mentoring students towards PhD degree programs. Moreover, it will help develop core facility expertise in cancer research techniques/instrumentation at Fresno State and enhance SBMRI accessibility to underrepresented minority student populations. The specific aims of the partnership are: (1) Study cancer incidence in the ethnically-prominent Central California. Two pilot projects will address NIH identified critical health issues-pancreatic cancer and breast cancer in the Hispanic population. Each project focuses on molecular analyses of cancers via screening by mass spectrometry/proteomics or NMR/ metabolomics. These will augment Fresno State resources and optimize data collection for faculty to successfully undertake cancer-related projects. (2) Train minority students during summer at SBMRI, UCSD, and at Fresno State within the cancer research projects during the school year. Central California has many unique features that impact the rates of cancer which justify the proposed partnership. The Valley has over 3 million people and several counties have a Hispanic populace in excess of 50%. Implications for specific cancers more common to Hispanics and the relative paucity of minority cancer researchers serve as the motivation for this long-term partnership between Fresno State and SBMRI Cancer Center. Both Internal and External Advisory Committees will provide strategic guidance by evaluating progress to achieve partnership goals in research, student training, and implementing plans for competitive funding of R01 and U54 grants. The need to support the development of minority scientists pursuing state-of-the-art cancer research is clear. The partnership of the SBMRI Cancer Center and Fresno State, an outstanding Hispanic-serving institution detailed in this proposal will support the cancer research career development of two of our most promising junior faculty and will stimulate Fresno State minority students to pursue PhD degrees in cancer research.",Fresno State-SBCC Partnership: Cancer Research & Training for Central PA (1 of 2),8318177,P20CA138025,"['Biology ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' California ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Environmental Carcinogens ', ' Chemistry ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Data Collection ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Incidence ', ' instrumentation ', ' Mentors ', ' Motivation ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Techniques ', ' Research Technics ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Risk ', ' Schools ', ' Mass Spectrum Analyses ', ' Mass Spectrum ', ' Mass Spectroscopy ', ' Mass Spectrometry ', ' Mass Photometry/Spectrum Analysis ', ' Mass Spectrum Analysis ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Medical Research ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' screenings ', ' screening ', ' Screening procedure ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Populations at Risk ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' farmworker ', ' farm worker ', ' General farm worker NOS ', ' Pancreatic Cancer ', ' Pancreas Cancer ', ' Malignant Pancreatic Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of pancreas ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' Training and Education ', ' cohort ', ' graduate student ', ' career development ', ' Proteomics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' metabolism measurement ', ' metabolomics ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY FRESNO,P20,2012,242662,0.11466591419090767

"Xavier's RCMI Cancer Research Program In the past decade, Xavier University of Louisiana has embarked on an ambitious, strategic initiative to enhance its research competitiveness in biomedical fields. Our long term goal is to, in the next 5 to 7 years, be seen nationally not only for our eminence in graduating African American science, pre-med and pharmacy students, but also for national prominence in cancer research. Since 2002, in spite of the destruction rendered by Katrina, Xavier has made significant advances toward achieving this goal through the establishment of both the Center for Minority Health Disparities, launched in 2002, and through membership in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium. Xavier researchers have received significant external funding for cancer research from the National Institutes of Health, Department of Defense, National Cancer Institute, and Louisiana Board of Regents, among others. To determine what next steps needed to be taken to build on the above-described progress and take Xavier ""to the next level,"" a comprehensive RCMI planning process was carried out through faculty and staff surveys, focus groups, and forums, with the assistance of a variety of external advisors. As a result, barriers to competitiveness and strategies to overcoming them were identified in such areas as recruiting and retaining research competitive faculty, infrastructural support for biomedical research, and lack of centralized core laboratories with supporting staff. To address these barriers, this proposal requests funding to assist Xavier in: (1) increasing the number and quality of Cancer researchers and providing them with start-up packages, release time, and mentoring opportunities; 2) enhancing the competitiveness of existing research faculty and programs by providing seed funding for developmental projects, enhanced professional development opportunities and increased access to postdoctoral associates and research staff; (3) developing three research instrumentation cores; (4) offering enhanced administrative services to assure research support activities meet faculty needs, and (5) supporting selected pilot projects that will assist investigators who are at the ""cusp"" of becoming fully competitive. Nationally, and particularly in Louisiana, there are significant disparities between Caucasians and African Americans with regard to Cancer incidence and mortality.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research. Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists. The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores: Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core. In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.

"NCCU-LCCC Partnership in Cancer Research (2 of 2) The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at  the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) propose to continue an effective, sustainable, and  mutually beneficial partnership in Cancer Research that focuses on African-American health disparities.  During the U56 funding period, the two institutions have firmly established the Partnership by building on  complementary institutional strengths, conducting joint planning in molecular cancer research, populationbased  research and training of junior faculty and students. The Partnership now proposes to expand these  initiatives through an NCI-funded Cooperative Planning Grant (U54) for Comprehensive Partnerships to  Reduce Cancer Health Disparities. Our objectives are: (1) To expand research collaborations among the two  institutions; (2) To use research activities in and outside the U54 mechanism to train students and junior/midlevel  faculty in multidisciplinary research aimed at reducing cancer disparities; and (3) To expand and  consolidate programs of community outreach and education. The strengths of each institution are uniquely  positioned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative  components of the proposal include: 3 full projects in basic cancer research, one full and two pilot projects in  community outreach, one minority training project, and one shared resource to enhance NCCU infrastructure  and the partnership. The extensive expertise, and resources of LCCC In cancer research and cancer  education training, the demonstrated interest in minority health disparities and the experience of NCCU in  reaching minority populations, faculty and students, are complementary institutional strengths that will help  the Partnership: 1) establish an effective cancer research infrastructure/program with ROI-funded  researchers; 2) increase training opportunities at a minority serving institution; 3) enhance community- and  population-based research targeting cancer-related health disparities at both institutions; and 4) increase  training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  African-Americans suffer a disproportionate share of the cancer burden, with overall cancer mortality rate  averaging one third higher than Caucasian Americans. Furthermore, for cancers such as prostate or cervical  cancer where treatment can be effective, the rates of treatment failure or recurrence are higher in African  Americans.

Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center.             Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants of the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival.

(CPX) developed a unique system (device and protocols) to greatly enhance the convenience, success rate, and reproducibility of biospecimen acquisition and shipping. This passively-cooled system is laboratory-validated and has a proven track record of performance in biomarker- based multi-center clinical trials including three sponsored by NCI cooperative groups. However, as experience has been gained with the system, opportunities for improvement have been defined. Specifically, the experience of CPX shows that a passively-cooled system is inherently unable to guarantee tissue sample quality when simultaneously shipping multiple temperature specimens under different environmental conditions and when operated by technicians with varying experience levels. The specific aim of this project is to create a reusable actively-cooled system to conveniently and reproducibly refrigerate multiple tissue samples to <-700C, 40C and 150C and precisely maintain temperatures during shipment. The research strategy is to expand existing CPX technology partnerships to access the expertise required to achieve the considerable thermodynamic, refrigeration, design, fabrication, hardware and software innovation and laboratory testing necessary to achieve the goals of this proposal. ""Off- the-shelf"" components will be utilized to the greatest extent possible, to take advantage of existing technology, reduce project time and expense as well as the anticipated cost of the final product. The practical benefits of a successful project to improve biospecimen cryopreservation and shipping from patient to analytical laboratory will be to: 1.) substantially increase the reliability and reproducibility of biospecimen preservation and shipping; 2.) create broader access to the collection of a wide range of tissue types; 3.) improve the convenience and flexibility of tissue acquisition; and, 4.) reduce the cost and environmental impact over current single-use solutions. In the long-term, these benefits support the mission of NCI OBBR: ""to guide, coordinate, and develop the Institute's biospecimen resources and capabilities and ensure that human biospecimens available for cancer research are of the highest quality""1 1. National Cancer Institute (NCI), Office of Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research (OBBR) website.       Key to cancer research today, and widespread implementation of ""personalized"" medical technologies in the future, is the need for significantly increased consistency and accessibility of biospecimen preservation and shipping from patient to analytical laboratory.

Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants of the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU:  Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 2 of 3)",8337746,U54CA163072,"['Age ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chemistry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' nanotech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' nano scale Science ', ' Nanoscale Science ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U54,2012,1044393,0.1388553331135533
"Center of Excellence for Cancer Research, Training and Community Service     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Florida A&M University (FAMU) College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (COPPS) proposes the establishment of an Exploratory Center of Excellence (COE) in the area of Cancer Research, Training and Community Service (CRTCS). African-Americans experience the highest mortality rates associated with most cancer (breast, lung, prostate, etc.) deaths despite decreases in morbidity rates for all other racial and ethnic groups since early 1990. Health disparities are closely related to underlying socioeconomic inequalities and have been linked to racial differences among cancer mortality which presents major challenges across the entire spectrum of cancer prevention, early detection, and access to high quality care for disadvantage and underrepresented groups. The overall goal and objective of the COE CRTCS will consist of researchers focusing on developing innovative cancer research (breast and lung) abnormalities utilizing an interdisciplinary and synergistic approach toward addressing some of the most significant health consequences in minority and socioeconomic disadvantaged populations. This will address novel and innovative approaches to treating and preventing breast and lung cancer. The administrative; biomedical and behavioral research; research training/educational and community engagement/outreach cores will enable the COE CRTCS to accomplish the proposed initiatives. The specific aims of the COE CRTCS are to: 1) Develop detailed innovative research plans that will address specific cancer (breast and lung) health issues that disproportionately impact African-American; 2) Develop a research team conducting cancer research; 3) Train minority PhD graduate students in health disparities research affecting disadvantage and minority populations; 4) Increase the number of minority scientists engaged in biomedical and behavioral research; 5) Establish and enhance community outreach and information dissemination activities that will increase prevention efforts and foster early detection towards reducing breast cancer in African-American women (Leon and Gadsden County, Florida); 6) Establish and expand partnerships with community engagement/outreach organizations toward addressing and conducting minority health and other health disparities issues; and 7) Position FAMU to become more competitive in securing mainstream funding in biomedical and behavioral research support and addressing minority health disparities. The support of this application will promote minority health and aid i the elimination of health disparities as it relates to breast (among African-American females) and lung cancer (among minorities).

"Fresno State-SBCC Partnership:Cancer Research & Training for Central CA  (2 of 2) California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) has established a partnership with the NCl-designated Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute (SBMRI) Cancer Center and is applying for a P20 feasibility grant. The goals of the partnership are: a) enhance cancer research potential at Fresno State (a minority serving institution), b) train cohorts of undergraduate and graduate students for future cancer research careers, and c) track students to evaluate program progress. The partnership will combine strengths of both institutions in offering cancer biology education, research, and training in the Fresno State curricula. It will facilitate an intensive exposure of Fresno State students to world-class SBMRI faculty, graduate and postdoctoral resources by mentoring students towards PhD degree programs. Moreover, it will help develop core facility expertise in cancer research techniques/instrumentation at Fresno State and enhance SBMRI accessibility to underrepresented minority student populations. The specific aims of the partnership are: (1) Study cancer incidence in the ethnically-prominent Central California. Two pilot projects will address NIH identified critical health issues-pancreatic cancer and breast cancer in the Hispanic population. Each project focuses on molecular analyses of cancers via screening by mass spectrometry/proteomics or NMR/ metabolomics. These will augment Fresno State resources and optimize data collection for faculty to successfully undertake cancer-related projects. (2) Train minority students during summer at SBMRI, UCSD, and at Fresno State within the cancer research projects during the school year. Central California has many unique features that impact the rates of cancer which justify the proposed partnership. The Valley has over 3 million people and several counties have a Hispanic populace in excess of 50%. Implications for specific cancers more common to Hispanics and the relative paucity of minority cancer researchers serve as the motivation for this long-term partnership between Fresno State and SBMRI Cancer Center. Both Internal and External Advisory Committees will provide strategic guidance by evaluating progress to achieve partnership goals in research, student training, and implementing plans for competitive funding of R01 and U54 grants. The need to support the development of minority scientists pursuing state-of-the-art cancer research is clear.

"Medical Student Summer Program in Integrative Science and Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic minorities and underserved populations suffer a disproportionate burden of cancer related morbidity and mortality. Minority investigators may be an important resource to address this disparity, however, there are few highly trained minority cancer researchers equipped to focus on this concern. One strategy to correct this shortage is to mentor undergraduate minority medical students in order to encourage them to pursue careers as cancer researchers. While Meharry Medical College (MMC) is a minority-serving institution whose curriculum has been oriented to primary care, in the last decade it has also focused on training academic research oriented physician scientists. As a result, the NCI awarded a U-54 Partnership Grant to MMC and the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) which was successfully renewed in 2006. MMC also received a Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MCCOP) grant in 2004 which was renewed in 2006. Both of these grants are concentrated on cancer basic science, translational and clinical research and will be used to augment teaching and research opportunities provided by this application. This competing renewal proposal continues our goal of significantly increasing the number of minority medical students who develop and maintain an interest in pursuing a career in cancer research by providing a meaningful short-term cancer research experience in a research intensive environment.             The specific aims are to:    1. Identify and select first year medical students who have expressed a strong research interest in the biomedical, clinical, or epidemiologic aspects of cancer at a minority serving institution, and whose academic records are strong.   2. Match medical students with experienced cancer researchers in an area of shared interest of the students.    3. Facilitate and enhance this short-term research exposure of medical students and cancer researchers by     3.1 providing weekly interactions with Meharry Medical College faculty involved in cancer research to  reinforce the concepts of hypothesis-testing, selecting the optimal experimental strategies, analyzing and  interpreting data and integrating data across the spectrum of research strategies, and   3.2 providing a weekly luncheon where project summaries and data updates are provided in a nurturing  environment.   4. Provide a venue for the dissemination of student research findings among student peers and cancer researchers at the conclusion of the summer and the following spring, in an institution-wide program.    5. Advise and mentor the selected students through the residency match selection process to encourage their identification of research-linked residencies.    6. Track the selected students through residency training and ultimate career choice.        Ethnic/racial minority populations suffer a disproportionate burden of cancer.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research This is a resubmission for The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Partnership for Excellence in Research Grant, which addresses comments and recommendations from the 1) summary statement, 2) NCI Site Visit, and 3) IAC and PSC Committees. Areas strengthened in this application include: leadership, communication, committee oversight, evaluation, career development and mentorship. Funds granted in this award will be used to: 1) support 3 full projects in cancer biology and prevention and 1 pilot project in epidemiology, 2) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations, 3) increase faculty/trainee participation in the training program, 4) expand efforts in our Outreach Program to impact a larger audience, and 5) fortify and stabilize the infrastructure developing at the UPRCCC.   Research grants included target 1) developing new cancer imaging techniques, 2) regulating RNA in eukaryotic cells, 3) reducing cancer risk through combined alcohol and tobacco treatment and 4) assessing the role of insulin resistance syndrome as a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The Outreach Program, which was added into the original grant mid-year 3, has been expanded to include cancer related to tobacco, as well as breast, cervical and HPV. The Training Program has also been expanded in scope to impact more faculty and trainees through a comprehensive career development and mentorship training program.   The original grant (2002) was awarded to establish a comprehensive long-term mutually beneficial relationship to target and eradicate cancer health disparities. The two short term objectives of the original application were met: 1) develop independent cancer research investigators and 2) establish a strong working relationship based on mutual benefit, identified strengths and reciprocity. The 3rd long-term objective of the Partnership is to regain NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Thus far, the Partnership has set the foundation for a dynamic collaboration dedicated to enhancing each partner's strengths and eliminating each partner's weaknesses. The Partnership has also served as the catalyst for two major laws passed in Puerto Rico, one of which resulted in the allocation of funding for establishing the infrastructure and recruiting top notch faculty to the UPRCCC. As of 2008, the Partnership is far from reaching its long-range goal of regaining NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Funding for the U54 resubmission is critical to maintain the momentum of the Partnership's joint efforts in Cancer Research, Training and Outreach. This resubmission seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPRCCC and MDACC. By addressing the differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership will strive to reduce these differences through efforts in Research, Outreach, and Training. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.",UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research,8322845,U54CA096300,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Award ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laws ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Syndrome ', ' Tobacco ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' notch protein ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' National Cancer Program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Site Visit ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U54,2012,1263850,0.07590812939638289

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research. Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research. Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists. The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores: Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core. In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.

"The CCNY/MSKCC Partnership for Research, Training and Outreach This proposal describes our plans to establish the City College of New York/Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (U54) Partnership for Cancer Research, Training and Community Outreach. We have established five focused objectives for our Partnership. The first objective is to continue to develop programs of translational research in cell biology, immunology, and biomedical engineering.  One full research project and six pilot research projects are included in our application. These projects emphasize this aim. The second objective is to expand and consolidate collaborative programs of multidisciplinary and transdisciplinary research in cancer disparities. Of the six pilot projects included, two pilot projects address this objective. Our third objective is to mobilize Partnership resources to collaborate with diverse communities in innovative ways, to define and address cancer disparities at the local level, and to point the way to broader solutions that may be disseminated and tested in future research. Our proposed PCOP will provide an infrastructure to work with community stakeholders to systematically identify and prioritize possible avenues for action.  PCOP will be involved with ""in-reach"" as well as outreach to bring resources to underserved communities. Our fourth objective is to attract and retain students interested in cancer research, and in particular minority students, through active recruitment, enhanced education and training opportunities, and increased mentorship and support. We are expanding support for the COURT Program to enable systematic recruitment of undergraduate students, expanded course offerings, mentored placements, and career guidance. A Graduate Student Training Plan is also included in our Developmental Core. Our fifth objective is to expand and integrate the personnel, resources, and environment needed for scientific collaboration. The Partnership will recruit new faculty members at both CCNY and MSKCC. U54 resources will help to support appointments in key CCNY divisions At MSKCC, faculty lines will add to our capacity to conduct community-based intervention research and the development of the PCOP.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmission for The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) and The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) Partnership for Excellence in Research Grant, which addresses comments and recommendations from the 1) summary statement, 2) NCI Site Visit, and 3) IAC and PSC Committees. Areas strengthened in this application include: leadership, communication, committee oversight, evaluation, career development and mentorship. Funds granted in this award will be used to: 1) support 3 full projects in cancer biology and prevention and 1 pilot project in epidemiology, 2) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations, 3) increase faculty/trainee participation in the training program, 4) expand efforts in our Outreach Program to impact a larger audience, and 5) fortify and stabilize the infrastructure developing at the UPRCCC. Research grants included target 1) developing new cancer imaging techniques, 2) regulating RNA in eukaryotic cells, 3) reducing cancer risk through combined alcohol and tobacco treatment and 4) assessing the role of insulin resistance syndrome as a risk factor for endometrial cancer. The Outreach Program, which was added into the original grant mid-year 3, has been expanded to include cancer related to tobacco, as well as breast, cervical and HPV. The Training Program has also been expanded in scope to impact more faculty and trainees through a comprehensive career development and mentorship training program. The original grant (2002) was awarded to establish a comprehensive long-term mutually beneficial relationship to target and eradicate cancer health disparities. The two short term objectives of the original application were met: 1) develop independent cancer research investigators and 2) establish a strong working relationship based on mutual benefit, identified strengths and reciprocity. The 3rd long-term objective of the Partnership is to regain NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Thus far, the Partnership has set the foundation for a dynamic collaboration dedicated to enhancing each partner's strengths and eliminating each partner's weaknesses. The Partnership has also served as the catalyst for two major laws passed in Puerto Rico, one of which resulted in the allocation of funding for establishing the infrastructure and recruiting top notch faculty to the UPRCCC. As of 2008, the Partnership is far from reaching its long-range goal of regaining NCI-designation for the UPRCCC. Funding for the U54 resubmission is critical to maintain the momentum of the Partnership's joint efforts in Cancer Research, Training and Outreach.             This resubmission seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPRCCC and MDACC. By addressing the differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership will strive to reduce these differences through efforts in Research, Outreach, and Training. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.",UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research,8537559,U54CA096297,"['Alcohol Chemical Class ', ' Alcohols ', ' Award ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communication ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Eukaryotic Cell ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Incidence ', ' wart virus ', ' Infectious Human Wart Virus ', ' Human Papilloma Virus ', ' HPV ', ' Human Papillomavirus ', ' insulin resistant ', ' Insulin Resistance ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Laws ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentorship ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Recommendation ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' Ribonucleic Acid ', ' RNA Gene Products ', ' Non-Polyadenylated RNA ', ' RNA ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Syndrome ', ' Tobacco ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Imaging Technics ', ' Imaging Procedures ', ' Imaging Techniques ', ' notch receptors ', ' notch ', ' notch protein ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' catalyst ', ' base ', ' Cervical ', ' Area ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Fostering ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Collaborations ', ' Viewpoint ', ' Editorial Comment ', ' Commentary ', ' Comment ', ' Published Comment ', ' Endometrium Carcinoma ', ' Endometrium Cancer ', ' Endometrial Cancer ', ' Endometrial Carcinoma ', ' meetings ', ' cancer risk ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' Address ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' National Cancer Program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Site Visit ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer imaging ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,U54,2012,202000,0.07590812939638289
"Increasing Minority Participation in Cancer Prevention and Control    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of the District of Columbia (UDC) proposes to establish a Cancer Research and Education Academy (the Academy) in conjunction with the Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at Georgetown University Medical Center. It is designed for science students who have an interest in entering cancer research careers.

"UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request 5-year renewal of support for our Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) Summer Internship Program which has run remarkably well and achieved the goals stated in our 2003 application. The long-term goal of CaRES is to stimulate UAB medical students and graduate students in Medicine, Public Health, Dentistry, Health Professions and Nursing, to consider careers in cancer research. In the past 5 years CaRES has supported 237 students who undertook 188 cancer research projects based at UAB's Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC). In summers 2010 - 2014 we will recruit 200 students (""CaRES Interns"") to undertake summer cancer internships of 8 to 16 weeks with ""CaRES Preceptors"" drawn from 300 CCC faculty members engaged in over 400 funded research grants in the basic sciences, translation, prevention and control, and clinical care. Our novel and widely applicable web-based approach will allow students to self-match to the CaRES projects best for them, in light of their background and career interests. Minority recruiting, which has been very successful to date, will be enhanced via linkages with the CCC's Morehouse / Tuskegee / UAB Partnership through UAB's Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center. Interns will receive a locally competitive stipend. They will attend the ""CaRES Career Development Seminars"" to stimulate their interest in cancer research careers and to share their research methodology and findings with fellow interns. Supply money is requested to stimulate third-year medical students to undertake their ""Scholarly Activity"" (required by UAB's School of Medicine) with their CaRES Preceptor from their first year. CaRES Interns will submit abstracts of their work for presentation at the CCC's Annual Research Retreat, UAB's Medical Student Research Day, and at regional and national meetings. We will continue to rigorously evaluate all aspects of CaRES via Intern and Preceptor exit questionnaires so that achievements can be documented and further improvements can be made. Longitudinal tracking reveals that 11% of CaRES Alumni who have completed their original degree programs are engaged in cancer research careers and another 30% are pursuing additional academic or professional training that involves cancer patients or cancer activities that could position them for cancer research careers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most medical students plan a career in medical practice, rather than a research career. But many more cancer researchers are needed in order to understand how to prevent cancer and how to cure it. We will pay medical students to do summer research projects with professors from the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, in order to stimulate each medical student to seriously consider a career in cancer research.

"Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership The overall objective of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparifies. This is being achieved through our programs of Cancer Research, Cancer Training, Cancer Education, Cancer Outreach, Bioethics, and Biostatisfics, which are leading to sustained, integrated, organizational changes at the three Institutions. Significant milestones have been reached. At MSM, a Cancer Research Program (CRP) was established In 2007 by developing an organizational framework for the previously disconnected cancer research scientists and teams. The program consists of four sections, Basic Science Research, Community and Epidemiological Research, Clinical Trials Exploratory, and Research Training and Career Development. Thirty faculty members from diverse scientific disciplines are associated with the CRP. In parallel, TU has demonstrated increased capacity to conduct research on cancerhealth disparities by training and garnering a crifical mass of scienfists who focus on reducing and ellminafing these disparifies. In 2005, 7 scientists at TU were involved in some aspect of cancer research, compared to 17 in 2010. With the central teaching mission of Tuskegee, the training of 9 undergraduates and 22 graduate students in cancer research since 2005 demonstrates TU's ability to establish a pipeline of prospective minority investigators who are focusing on cancer research. This growth in health disparity research and education led to the creation, in December 2010, of the Health Disparities Institute for Research and Education (HDIRE) at TU. Dr. Roberta Troy, Co-PI on the U54 Partnership, was appointed as its founding director. The HDIRE has as its mission the eliminafion and/or mitigation of health disparities through research, education, and training, and through advocacy of policies relevant to underserved populations, particularly in the Black Belt region of Alabama. The UAB CCC has similarly expanded its capacity to conduct cancer health disparities research. In the past 5 years, UAB has recruited 6 new faculty members involved in such research. Each of the institutions has had increases in cancer research funding, indicating scientific productivity. At MSM, S8M was secured in 2000 to support cancer research. By 2005, cancer research funding increased to $18M, and, by 2010, to $26M. Similarly, cancer research funding increased at TU, exceeding $6M in 2010. At the UAB CCC, there was an increase in annual funding from $12M in 2005 to $22M by 2010 in its Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program. This increase was mostly related to research on cancer disparities. While the evaluation of each of the cores and programs is detailed in the respective sections, it is appropriate to highlight some of the achievements. The Developmental Research Proaram continues to be strengthened and to produce competitive and productive investigators. Since its inception, 10 pilot projects and 1 full project have been awarded, and ail but one pilot have been or are being successfully conducted. As of December 2010, 17 peer-reviewed publicafions direcfiy related to the goals of U54 have been generated, a remarkable increase from 1 publication in 2008. Addifionally, investigators of this Partnership have published 75 peer-reviewed manuscripts that are directly related to cancer disparifies (see Appendix A-C). Over the past 5 years, the Cancer Trainina Proqram has trained 81 scholars (28 junior faculty and 53 graduate students) to perform cancer-related research. While 61% of the scholars have extramural funding, 21% have secured additional extramural funding since complefing the program.), and 43% of them have published manuscripts. The Cancer Education Proaram, which is essential for ensuring a pipeline of well-trained students who elect to pursue research in cancer health disparities and related professions, has developed a cancer-related course (Foundations of Cancer Biology) that has been incorporated and sustained as part of the TU curriculum. Recenfiy, Cancer Education Co-Leaders and Bioethics Shared Resource members of the Partnership have developed and offered a Health Disparifies, Bioethics, and Policy course at TU. The Cancer Outreach Programs, based on the community health advisor model, have achieved their medium-term outcomes. Through a relationship with the Department of Public Health, the MSM program disseminated an intervenfion for colon cancer screening in the greater Afianta area. UAB's Cancer Outreach Program increased participation of African Americans in cancer therapeutic trials, with 180 referrals to the program and 124 cancer survivors enrolling in their IMPACT program. At TU, outreach efforts led to a program addressing healthy lifestyles among rural residents, with participants increasing physical activity and making improved dietary choices. Bioethics acfivities continue to be highly rated within the Partnership and by other collaborators. As essential resources, Biostatistics and Bioethics are integrated throughout the Partnership. In summary, consistent with the outcomes oufiined in our Evaluafion Framework developed for the previous applicafion, our tripartite Partnership has achieved short and medium-term outcomes and is now realizing long-term outcomes, including integrated, organizational changes at each of the institutions. These will lead to high-quality research on cancer health disparities, produce well-trained invesfigators, and reduce cancer disparities.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC).  The overall theme of our proposal is to reduce the cancer research disparities in the two institutions.  Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research.  This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project.  Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education.  Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC.  Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students.  Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities.  The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change.  NMSU also plans to hire a new faculty investigator.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength.   Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions.  NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research.  A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers.  The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research.  Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists.  The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores:  Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core.  In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.

"UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request 5-year renewal of support for our Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) Summer Internship Program which has run remarkably well and achieved the goals stated in our 2003 application. The long-term goal of CaRES is to stimulate UAB medical students and graduate students in Medicine, Public Health, Dentistry, Health Professions and Nursing, to consider careers in cancer research. In the past 5 years CaRES has supported 237 students who undertook 188 cancer research projects based at UAB's Comprehensive Cancer Center (CCC). In summers 2010 - 2014 we will recruit 200 students (""CaRES Interns"") to undertake summer cancer internships of 8 to 16 weeks with ""CaRES Preceptors"" drawn from 300 CCC faculty members engaged in over 400 funded research grants in the basic sciences, translation, prevention and control, and clinical care. Our novel and widely applicable web-based approach will allow students to self-match to the CaRES projects best for them, in light of their background and career interests. Minority recruiting, which has been very successful to date, will be enhanced via linkages with the CCC's Morehouse / Tuskegee / UAB Partnership through UAB's Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Center. Interns will receive a locally competitive stipend. They will attend the ""CaRES Career Development Seminars"" to stimulate their interest in cancer research careers and to share their research methodology and findings with fellow interns. Supply money is requested to stimulate third-year medical students to undertake their ""Scholarly Activity"" (required by UAB's School of Medicine) with their CaRES Preceptor from their first year. CaRES Interns will submit abstracts of their work for presentation at the CCC's Annual Research Retreat, UAB's Medical Student Research Day, and at regional and national meetings. We will continue to rigorously evaluate all aspects of CaRES via Intern and Preceptor exit questionnaires so that achievements can be documented and further improvements can be made. Longitudinal tracking reveals that 11% of CaRES Alumni who have completed their original degree programs are engaged in cancer research careers and another 30% are pursuing additional academic or professional training that involves cancer patients or cancer activities that could position them for cancer research careers.      PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Most medical students plan a career in medical practice, rather than a research career. But many more cancer researchers are needed in order to understand how to prevent cancer and how to cure it. We will pay medical students to do summer research projects with professors from the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, in order to stimulate each medical student to seriously consider a career in cancer research.

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC), Tennessee State University (TSU) and Vanderbilt-lngram Cancer Center (VICC) resulting in this formal Cancer Partnership. Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center.             RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants ofthe disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research  infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)",8539353,U54CA163066,"['Age ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chemistry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' nanotech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' nano scale Science ', ' Nanoscale Science ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2013,777913,0.1371329293323763
"Medical Student Summer Program in Integrative Science and Cancer Research    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic minorities and underserved populations suffer a disproportionate burden of cancer related morbidity and mortality. Minority investigators may be an important resource to address this disparity, however, there are few highly trained minority cancer researchers equipped to focus on this concern. One strategy to correct this shortage is to mentor undergraduate minority medical students in order to encourage them to pursue careers as cancer researchers. While Meharry Medical College (MMC) is a minority-serving institution whose curriculum has been oriented to primary care, in the last decade it has also focused on training academic research oriented physician scientists. As a result, the NCI awarded a U-54 Partnership Grant to MMC and the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) which was successfully renewed in 2006. MMC also received a Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MCCOP) grant in 2004 which was renewed in 2006. Both of these grants are concentrated on cancer basic science, translational and clinical research and will be used to augment teaching and research opportunities provided by this application. This competing renewal proposal continues our goal of significantly increasing the number of minority medical students who develop and maintain an interest in pursuing a career in cancer research by providing a meaningful short-term cancer research experience in a research intensive environment.             The specific aims are to:    1. Identify and select first year medical students who have expressed a strong research interest in the biomedical, clinical, or epidemiologic aspects of cancer at a minority serving institution, and whose academic records are strong.   2. Match medical students with experienced cancer researchers in an area of shared interest of the students.    3. Facilitate and enhance this short-term research exposure of medical students and cancer researchers by     3.1 providing weekly interactions with Meharry Medical College faculty involved in cancer research to  reinforce the concepts of hypothesis-testing, selecting the optimal experimental strategies, analyzing and  interpreting data and integrating data across the spectrum of research strategies, and   3.2 providing a weekly luncheon where project summaries and data updates are provided in a nurturing  environment.   4. Provide a venue for the dissemination of student research findings among student peers and cancer researchers at the conclusion of the summer and the following spring, in an institution-wide program.    5. Advise and mentor the selected students through the residency match selection process to encourage their identification of research-linked residencies.    6. Track the selected students through residency training and ultimate career choice.        Ethnic/racial minority populations suffer a disproportionate burden of cancer. Although underrepresented minority investigators would be an important resource to help eliminate this disparity, few are highly trained in this field. This proposal will address this need by providing short term cancer research programs for medical students enrolled at Meharry Medical College the majority of whom represent ethnic/racial minorities.

"Center of Excellence for Cancer Research, Training and Community Service     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Florida A&M University (FAMU) College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (COPPS) proposes the establishment of an Exploratory Center of Excellence (COE) in the area of Cancer Research, Training and Community Service (CRTCS). African-Americans experience the highest mortality rates associated with most cancer (breast, lung, prostate, etc.) deaths despite decreases in morbidity rates for all other racial and ethnic groups since early 1990. Health disparities are closely related to underlying socioeconomic inequalities and have been linked to racial differences among cancer mortality which presents major challenges across the entire spectrum of cancer prevention, early detection, and access to high quality care for disadvantage and underrepresented groups. The overall goal and objective of the COE CRTCS will consist of researchers focusing on developing innovative cancer research (breast and lung) abnormalities utilizing an interdisciplinary and synergistic approach toward addressing some of the most significant health consequences in minority and socioeconomic disadvantaged populations. This will address novel and innovative approaches to treating and preventing breast and lung cancer. The administrative; biomedical and behavioral research; research training/educational and community engagement/outreach cores will enable the COE CRTCS to accomplish the proposed initiatives. The specific aims of the COE CRTCS are to: 1) Develop detailed innovative research plans that will address specific cancer (breast and lung) health issues that disproportionately impact African-American; 2) Develop a research team conducting cancer research; 3) Train minority PhD graduate students in health disparities research affecting disadvantage and minority populations; 4) Increase the number of minority scientists engaged in biomedical and behavioral research; 5) Establish and enhance community outreach and information dissemination activities that will increase prevention efforts and foster early detection towards reducing breast cancer in African-American women (Leon and Gadsden County, Florida); 6) Establish and expand partnerships with community engagement/outreach organizations toward addressing and conducting minority health and other health disparities issues; and 7) Position FAMU to become more competitive in securing mainstream funding in biomedical and behavioral research support and addressing minority health disparities. The support of this application will promote minority health and aid i the elimination of health disparities as it relates to breast (among African-American females) and lung cancer (among minorities).

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) In recognition of the need to create more institutions that have competitive research programs, to recruit more underrepresented individuals into cancer research, and to increase the attention to cancer health disparities research, we propose to expand the collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC). Three objectives will help us achieve our overall goal. First, we will increase the capacity of NMSU to conduct competitive research. This will be done through a collection of three basic science pilot projects and one basic science full project. Second, we will create a long-standing partnership in cancer research training and education. Our full undergraduate project proposal builds on a successful internship program between NMSU and FHCRC. Our graduate pilot project paves the way to reciprocal training of graduate students. Finally, an outreach proposal seeks to evaluate a way to bring public health intervention to communities suffering from cancer health disparities. The outreach proposal will test the efficacy of the promotora approach in fostering cervical cancer screening behavior change. A well established and rigorous review process will be used to identify additional collaborative projects in later years. An effort to expand outreach efforts in the state will also be developed based on a new faculty hire and an existing network of Cooperative Extension Service offices.  Both institutions are enthusiastic about this collaboration and have worked steadily to increase the partnership strength. Mutual benefits will accrue to both institutions. NMSU has a majority of minority and underrepresented students, but not the expertise and experience to recruit and train students in cancer research. A major benefit of this grant will be to establish an infrastructure whereby underrepresented students have opportunities and resources to become cancer researchers. The FHCRC is deeply committed to increasing the number of minority and underrepresented group members involved in cancer research. Collaboration with scientists at NMSU also provides opportunities for new types of research that are of interest to FHCRC scientists. The five pilot projects and two full projects proposed in the developmental core are accompanied by three other cores: Administrative Core, Mentoring Core, and Planning and Evaluation Core. In addition, sound career development approaches will train future cancer researchers.

"MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research The American Association for Cancer Research requests renewal of support for the project entitled ?MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research.? The funds provide scholar awards to support the attendance of full-time faculty from Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) at highcaliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multilevel program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of under-representation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. The broad objective of the project is to increase the oncological knowledge base and participation of faculty from Minority-Serving Institutions in cancer research. MSIs encompass Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges & Universities (TCUs). Awardees receive funds for travel, hotel, subsistence, and registration fees in conjunction with their attendance at the AACR Annual Meeting or an AACR Special Conference. Their attendance at the Annual Meeting exposes them to the broad range of ongoing cancer research in basic, translational, and clinical areas, and at the Special Conferences, allows them to participate in those scientific sessions that are especially relevant to their research interests and professional growth. The project also aims to facilitate the MSI Faculty Scholars? professional relationships and networking possibilities with national and international cancer researchers, and to further their careers and enhance their recognition by professional peers through providing the opportunity to present and discuss their own research findings before national audiences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Beyond the direct benefits to Awardees, the program has potentially wider implications for the  health status of the minority population in general, resulting from the formation of a larger pool of  experienced minority basic cancer researchers and clinicians. First, the enhancement of the MSI  faculty member�s research program enriches the experience of the minority students he or she  trains. Second, minority investigators are more likely to explore the issues relating to minority  health disparities, as well as to have a better prospect of recruiting and collaborating with minority  study subjects, and a significant increase in the number and visibility of minority cancer researchers  might serve as an effective antidote to attitudes of distrust on the part of study participants and  help lead to greater trust on the part of minorities in the medical and research establishment.",MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research,8544996,R13CA076526,"['Theriacs ', ' Antidotes ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fees ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Study Subject ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' Population Sciences ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' minority health ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Population ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2013,74999,0.05921557156485684
"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU), a minority-serving institution, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), a comprehensive cancer center, is to expand the current regional cancer program at NMSU and to increase knowledge and attention to cancer related health disparities at FHCRC and NMSU. Three specific aims will help us achieve our overall goal: 1.To conduct a diverse portfolio of cancer research projects. We will use the same structured development and rigorous review process to select new projects during the five-year award. 2. To maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective training programs for current and future underserved scientists. A new core will integrate all training components. 3. To implement cancer-related public health interventions in underserved communities. As part of this aim, we will conduct research and disseminate evidence-based practices. This proposal begins with a section elucidating the overall objectives and partnership integration of the proposal. We discuss our goals and objectives, our planning, and especially our progress in the current U54. This is followed by an Administrative Core (Core B) that describes the leadership of the two institutions and the mechanism for ensuring junior faculty have sufficient mentorship to move to senior positions. Our Planning and Evaluation Core (Core C) outlines the rigorous procedures we have in place for evaluating current and future projects. The Development Core (Core D) includes two pilot projects and two full projects. Our new Integrated Training and Evaluation Core (Core E) seeks to provide numerous opportunities for ongoing training and meticulous evaluation of those training activities. The Outreach Core (Core F) focuses on training medical residents and health care providers, an academic-community partnership, and outreach through Community Health Educators who will collaborate with the County Extension Service to provide evidence-based interventions to community members. A logic model indicates how the pieces come together to have significant impact on both cancer research and cancer disparities.             ",Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2),8609761,U54CA132381,"['Attention ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Leadership ', ' Logic ', ' Mentorship ', ' New Mexico ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Services ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' ']",NCI,FRED HUTCHINSON CANCER RESEARCH CENTER,U54,2013,1163501,0.12104574067099476
"Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership The overall objective of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparities. This is being achieved through our programs of Cancer Research, Cancer Training, Cancer Education, Cancer Outreach, Bioethics, and Biostatistics, which are leading to sustained, integrated, organizational changes at the three Institutions. Significant milestones have been reached.  At MSM, a Cancer Research Program (CRP) was established In 2007 by developing an organizational framework for the previously disconnected cancer research scientists and teams. The program consists of four sections, Basic Science Research, Community and Epidemiological Research, Clinical Trials Exploratory, and  Research Training and Career Development. Thirty faculty members from diverse scientific disciplines are associated with the CRP. In parallel, TU has demonstrated increased capacity to conduct research on cancerhealth disparities by training and garnering a critical mass of scientists who focus on reducing and eliminating  these disparities. In 2005, 7 scientists at TU were involved in some aspect of cancer research, compared to 17 in 2010. With the central teaching mission of Tuskegee, the training of 9 undergraduates and 22 graduate students in cancer research since 2005 demonstrates TU's ability to establish a pipeline of prospective minority  investigators who are focusing on cancer research. This growth in health disparity research and education led  to the creation, in December 2010, of the Health Disparities Institute for Research and Education (HDIRE) at TU. Dr. Roberta Troy, Co-PI on the U54 Partnership, was appointed as its founding director. The HDIRE has as its mission the elimination and/or mitigation of health disparities through research, education, and training,  and through advocacy of policies relevant to underserved populations, particularly in the Black Belt region of Alabama. The UAB CCC has similarly expanded its capacity to conduct cancer health disparities research. In the past 5 years, UAB has recruited 6 new faculty members involved in such research.  Each of the institutions has had increases in cancer research funding, indicating scientific productivity. At MSM, S8M was secured in 2000 to support cancer research. By 2005, cancer research funding increased to $18M, and, by 2010, to $26M. Similarly, cancer research funding increased at TU, exceeding $6M in 2010. At  the UAB CCC, there was an increase in annual funding from $12M in 2005 to $22M by 2010 in its Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program. This increase was mostly related to research on cancer disparities.  While the evaluation of each of the cores and programs is detailed in the respective sections, it is appropriate to highlight some of the achievements. The Developmental Research Proaram continues to be strengthened and to produce competitive and productive investigators. Since its inception, 10 pilot projects and 1 full project have been awarded, and all but one pilot have been or are being successfully conducted. As of December 2010, 17 peer-reviewed publications directly related to the goals of U54 have been generated, a remarkable increase from 1 publication in 2008. Additionally, investigators of this Partnership have published 75 peer-reviewed manuscripts that are directly related to cancer disparities (see Appendix A-C). Over the past 5 years, the Cancer Training Program has trained 81 scholars (28 junior faculty and 53 graduate students) to perform cancer-related research. While 61% of the scholars have extramural funding, 21% have secured additional extramural funding since completing the program.), and 43% of them have published manuscripts.  The Cancer Education Program, which is essential for ensuring a pipeline of well-trained students who elect to pursue research in cancer health disparities and related professions, has developed a cancer-related course (Foundations of Cancer Biology) that has been incorporated and sustained as part of the TU curriculum.  Recently, Cancer Education Co-Leaders and Bioethics Shared Resource members of the Partnership have developed and offered a Health Disparities, Bioethics, and Policy course at TU.  The Cancer Outreach Programs, based on the community health advisor model, have achieved their medium-term outcomes. Through a relationship with the Department of Public Health, the MSM program disseminated an intervention for colon cancer screening in the greater Atlanta area. UAB's Cancer Outreach Program increased participation of African Americans in cancer therapeutic trials, with 180 referrals to the  program and 124 cancer survivors enrolling in their IMPACT program. At TU, outreach efforts led to a program addressing healthy lifestyles among rural residents, with participants increasing physical activity and making improved dietary choices. Bioethics activities continue to be highly rated within the Partnership and by other collaborators. As essential resources, Biostatistics and Bioethics are integrated throughout the Partnership.  In summary, consistent with the outcomes outlined in our Evaluation Framework developed for the previous application, our tripartite Partnership has achieved short and medium-term outcomes and is now realizing long-term outcomes, including integrated, organizational changes at each of the institutions. These will lead to high-quality research on cancer health disparities, produce well-trained investigators, and reduce cancer disparities.

The extensive expertise, and  resources of LCCC in cancer research and cancer education training, the demonstrated interest in minority  health disparities and the experience of NCCU in reaching minority populaflons, faculty and students, are  complementary institutional strengths that will help the Partnership: 1) establish an effective cancer research  infrastructure/program and increase training opportunities at a minority serving institution; and 2) enhance  community- and populaflon-based research targeting minority cancer-related health disparities and increase  training ef minority scienflsts at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  African-Americans suffer a disproportionate share ofthe cancer burden, with overall cancer mortality rate  averaging one third higher than Caucasian Americans. Furthermore, for cancers such as prostate or cervical  cancer where treatment can be effective, the rates of treatment failure or recurrence are higher in African  Americans. This partnership will help address these health disparities by promoflng minority-targeted  research, and by developing the research infrastructure, capacity, and effectiveness of NCUU.",NCCU-LCCC Partrnership in Cancer Research (1 of 2),8547628,U54CA156735,"['Pilot Projects ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Recurrent ', ' Recurrence ', ' Research ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Students ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Research Activity ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' training project ', ' Address ', ' Basic Cancer Research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Lineberger Cancer Center ', ' UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Molecular ', ' minority health ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Eyeball ', ' Eye ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' North Carolina ', ' pilot study ', ' ']",NCI,NORTH CAROLINA CENTRAL UNIVERSITY,U54,2013,1347276,0.13479064320328757
"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) The overall goal of this collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU), a minority-serving institution, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), a comprehensive cancer center, is to expand the current regional cancer program at NMSU and to increase knowledge and attention to cancer related health disparities at FHCRC and NMSU. Three specific aims will help us achieve our overall goal: 1.To conduct a diverse portfolio of cancer research projects. We will use the same structured development and rigorous review process to select new projects during the five-year award. 2. To maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective training programs for current and future underserved scientists. A new core will integrate all training components. 3. To implement cancer-related public health interventions in underserved communities. As part of this aim, we will conduct research and disseminate evidence-based practices. This proposal begins with a section elucidating the overall objectives and partnership integration of the proposal. We discuss our goals and objectives, our planning, and especially our progress in the current U54. This is followed by an Administrative Core (Core B) that describes the leadership of the two institutions and the mechanism for ensuring junior faculty have sufficient mentorship to move to senior positions. Our Planning and Evaluation Core (Core C) outlines the rigorous procedures we have in place for evaluating current and future projects.

"Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer The American Association for Cancer Research requests renewal of support for the project entitled ?Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer.? The funds provide scholar awards to support the attendance of young scientists from NIH-recognized minority populations at highcaliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multilevel program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of under-representation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. Predoctoral (graduate and medical) students, clinical and postdoctoral fellows, residents, and junior investigators, who are either engaged in cancer research or have the training and the potential to make contributions in the field, are eligible for the award. It also applies only to minority groups that have been defined by the NCI as being traditionally underrepresented in cancer and biomedical research: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, Hispanic or Latino Americans, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. Awardees receive funds for travel, hotel, subsistence, and registration fees in conjunction with their attendance at the AACR Annual Meeting or an AACR Special Conference. Their attendance at one of these meetings exposes them to the full spectrum of high-quality cancer research being performed nationally and internationally, and buttresses their knowledge base in the cancer field. The project also aims to increase the number of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and biomedical science, to contribute to the research training and networking opportunities of young minority investigators in the cancer field, and to facilitate relationships between young minority scientists and senior investigators in the field, who may function as mentors and thereby contribute to the career development and professional success of young scientists as cancer researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Beyond the direct benefits to Awardees, the program has potentially wider implications for the  health status of the minority population in general, resulting from the formation of a larger pool of  minority cancer researchers and clinicians. This is because a wider pool of researchers will not only  train and inspire the next generations of minority researchers, but also further explore issues  relating to minority health disparities. In addition, Minority researchers have a better prospect of  recruiting and collaborating with minority study subjects, and a significant increase in the number  and visibility of minority cancer researchers might serve as an effective antidote to attitudes of  distrust on the part of study participants and help lead to greater trust on the part of minorities in  the medical and research establishment.",Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer,8544983,R13CA040577,"['Theriacs ', ' Antidotes ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Fees ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Medical Students ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Training and Education ', ' American ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaska Native ', ' career development ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' minority health ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2013,74999,0.09704068202503162
"The Cancer Bioinformatics Initiative: A UTSA/UTHSCSA Partnership (1 of 2)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rapid evolution of sophisticated data-intensive technologies has created a growing need for well-trained informatics scientists and computational biologists particularly in the field of cancer research.

"MMC, VICC & TSU:  Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 2 of 3) Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC), Tennessee State University (TSU) and Vanderbilt-lngram Cancer Center (VICC) resulting in this formal Cancer Partnership. Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants of the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU:  Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 2 of 3)",8541774,U54CA163072,"['Age ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chemistry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' nanotech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' nano scale Science ', ' Nanoscale Science ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U54,2013,975799,0.1388553331135533
"UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2)     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.              ",UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2),8609660,U54CA096297,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Faculty ', ' genetic biomarker ', ' Genetic Markers ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Medicine ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Physicians ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Puerto Rican ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' survivorship ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' socioeconomic position ', ' socio-economic position ', ' Socio-economic status ', ' Socioeconomic Status ', ' base ', ' Training ', ' African ', ' Fostering ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' Staging ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' interest ', ' Services ', ' magnetic ', ' Magnetism ', ' Training and Education ', ' cancer risk ', ' early detection ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' success ', ' Structure ', ' Prevention ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' ovarian cancer ', ' Ovary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Ovary ', ' Malignant Ovarian Tumor ', ' Malignant Ovarian Neoplasm ', ' Malignant neoplasm of ovary ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Smoking and Tobacco Use Cessation Interventions ', ' Smoking Cessation Intervention ', ' Quetelet index ', ' BMI z-score ', ' BMI percentile ', ' Body mass index ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' National Cancer Program ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' nano particle ', ' nanoparticle ', ' Prevalence ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' tumor ', ' Hyperthermia ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,U54,2013,1561341,0.038480132310094624

"2/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to establish a Partnership between Alabama State University (ASU) and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved African American population, has goals of attaining excellence in research focused on cancer health disparities. The two institutions possess unique strengths that supplement each other. At ASU, which is classified as a historically black college and university (HBCU), more than 90% of students and more than 60% of the faculty belong to an underserved minority community in which health disparities are a significant issue in various areas, including cancer. The UAB CCC, in contrast, has developed an extensive infrastructure and critical mass of scientists that are necessary for a sustained research program. Still, ASU has a cultural sensitivity and perspective that may be deficient in the UAB CCC. Thus, the partners will facilitate collaborations in cancer-related research, training (career development), and education to aid this underserved community. UAB CCC faculty/scientists will cooperate with faculty and students at ASU and thereby initiate cancer research programs, creating an conduit for ASU faculty and students to pursue cancer research programs. The proposed effort will engage underserved groups by providing advanced research in prostate and colorectal cancer (both of which are major cancer health disparities for African Americans), by providing training to students and faculty members and by introducing topics related to cancer health disparities into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at ASU. The proposed Partnership has an Administrative Core, a Cancer Research Program with two functioning projects, and a Cancer Training and Education Program. Within the Administrative Core, there are Bioethics Support, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Support, and Evaluation Support. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee, which will consist of two distinguished scientists of each institution; an Executive Committee with members of both institutions; and, for each organization, a Partnership Institutional Committee. The Cancer Training and Education Program will reach talented students and faculty at ASU, linking them to established investigators and to the research infrastructure at the UAB CCC, and facilitate faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student and education in the area of cancer research in order to increase the number of minority investigators involved in cancer research. The goal of the Bioethics support will be to provide exceptional bioethics education, training, guidance, and consultation throughout the Partnership. The goal of the Biostatistics/Bioinformatics support will be to address the statistical/bioinformatics needs of the research projects sponsored by the Partnership. The specific aims for the Partnership are: (1) to enhance, by development of junior faculty members, the research and administrative infrastructure to conduct competitive basic and community-based cancer research at ASU; (2) to develop investigators committed to research in cancer disparities at both partnering institutions; and (3) to establish a pipeline of minority cancer disparity researchers and health professionals between ASU and UAB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed partnership between Alabama State University (ASU), a Historically Black Colleges and University and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC) builds upon current efforts to establish collaborative research infrastructure between the two institutions. Each organization possesses a unique set of strengths that effectively cover inherent weaknesses of the other. Of note, the Partnership is geographically located within the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African American population.

"CCNY-MSKCC Partnership for Cancer Research Training & Community Outreach (1 of 2 DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The CCNY-MSKCC Partnership for Research, Training, and Community Outreach has created cross-institutional collaboration that has emphasized research across the translational continuum, the creation of a training pipeline for attracting minority and low income students to careers in cancer research, and the establishment of community networks and resources for conducting community-based participatory research among diverse, at-risk populations. We propose two full projects that focus on translational health disparities and biomedical engineering and a pilot project which represents collaboration between computer science (CCNY) and medical physics (MSKCC) investigators. The Training Core will continue to develop training experiences for attracting minority and low income students to careers in cancer research. The Partnership Community Outreach, Research, and Education Core (PCORE) will expand services and community liaisons to promote innovative community-based participatory research designed to reduce health disparities in the New York metropolitan area and nationally. The specific objectives are to: 1) continue to develop cancer research programs in health disparities, biomedical engineering, computer science / medical imaging, cancer cell biology, and immunology along the Translational Research Continuum (Stages TO through T4); 2) collaborate with diverse communities to conduct and facilitate trailblazing outreach and research to define and address cancer disparities for the large, medically underserved local and national communities; 3) continue to develop and expand training opportunities in a robust translational cancer research environment to attract and retain students interested in cancer research (particularly minority and low income students); these opportunities will be enhanced by educational and training opportunities and increased mentorship and support; 4) expand and integrate the personnel, resources, and environment needed for scientific collaboration across institutions.        RELEVANCE: Reduction of cancer health disparities is a high priority area requiring a multi-pronged approach that includes focused training, research, and community outreach. The CCNY-MSKCC Partnership for Research, Training, and Community Outreach provides a comprehensive approach for accomplishing these goals.

"Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership The overall objective of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparities. This is being achieved through our programs of Cancer Research, Cancer Training, Cancer Education, Cancer Outreach, Bioethics, and Biostatistics, which are leading to sustained, integrated, organizational changes at the three Institutions. Significant milestones have been reached.  At MSM, a Cancer Research Program (CRP) was established In 2007 by developing an organizational framework for the previously disconnected cancer research scientists and teams. The program consists of four sections, Basic Science Research, Community and Epidemiological Research, Clinical Trials Exploratory, and  Research Training and Career Development. Thirty faculty members from diverse scientific disciplines are associated with the CRP. In parallel, TU has demonstrated increased capacity to conduct research on cancerhealth disparities by training and garnering a critical mass of scientists who focus on reducing and eliminating  these disparities. In 2005, 7 scientists at TU were involved in some aspect of cancer research, compared to 17 in 2010. With the central teaching mission of Tuskegee, the training of 9 undergraduates and 22 graduate students in cancer research since 2005 demonstrates TU's ability to establish a pipeline of prospective minority  investigators who are focusing on cancer research. This growth in health disparity research and education led  to the creation, in December 2010, of the Health Disparities Institute for Research and Education (HDIRE) at TU. Dr. Roberta Troy, Co-PI on the U54 Partnership, was appointed as its founding director. The HDIRE has as its mission the elimination and/or mitigation of health disparities through research, education, and training,  and through advocacy of policies relevant to underserved populations, particularly in the Black Belt region of Alabama. The UAB CCC has similarly expanded its capacity to conduct cancer health disparities research. In the past 5 years, UAB has recruited 6 new faculty members involved in such research.  Each of the institutions has had increases in cancer research funding, indicating scientific productivity. At MSM, S8M was secured in 2000 to support cancer research. By 2005, cancer research funding increased to $18M, and, by 2010, to $26M. Similarly, cancer research funding increased at TU, exceeding $6M in 2010. At  the UAB CCC, there was an increase in annual funding from $12M in 2005 to $22M by 2010 in its Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program. This increase was mostly related to research on cancer disparities.  While the evaluation of each of the cores and programs is detailed in the respective sections, it is appropriate to highlight some of the achievements. The Developmental Research Proaram continues to be strengthened and to produce competitive and productive investigators. Since its inception, 10 pilot projects and 1 full project have been awarded, and all but one pilot have been or are being successfully conducted. As of December 2010, 17 peer-reviewed publications directly related to the goals of U54 have been generated, a remarkable increase from 1 publication in 2008. Additionally, investigators of this Partnership have published 75 peer-reviewed manuscripts that are directly related to cancer disparities (see Appendix A-C). Over the past 5 years, the Cancer Training Program has trained 81 scholars (28 junior faculty and 53 graduate students) to perform cancer-related research. While 61% of the scholars have extramural funding, 21% have secured additional extramural funding since completing the program.), and 43% of them have published manuscripts.  The Cancer Education Program, which is essential for ensuring a pipeline of well-trained students who elect to pursue research in cancer health disparities and related professions, has developed a cancer-related course (Foundations of Cancer Biology) that has been incorporated and sustained as part of the TU curriculum.  Recently, Cancer Education Co-Leaders and Bioethics Shared Resource members of the Partnership have developed and offered a Health Disparities, Bioethics, and Policy course at TU.  The Cancer Outreach Programs, based on the community health advisor model, have achieved their medium-term outcomes. Through a relationship with the Department of Public Health, the MSM program disseminated an intervention for colon cancer screening in the greater Atlanta area. UAB's Cancer Outreach Program increased participation of African Americans in cancer therapeutic trials, with 180 referrals to the  program and 124 cancer survivors enrolling in their IMPACT program. At TU, outreach efforts led to a program addressing healthy lifestyles among rural residents, with participants increasing physical activity and making improved dietary choices. Bioethics activities continue to be highly rated within the Partnership and by other collaborators. As essential resources, Biostatistics and Bioethics are integrated throughout the Partnership.  In summary, consistent with the outcomes outlined in our Evaluation Framework developed for the previous application, our tripartite Partnership has achieved short and medium-term outcomes and is now realizing long-term outcomes, including integrated, organizational changes at each of the institutions. These will lead to high-quality research on cancer health disparities, produce well-trained investigators, and reduce cancer disparities.

"NCCU-LCCC Partrnership in Cancer Research (1 of 2) The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at  the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) propose to continue an effective, sustainable, and  mutually beneficial partnership in Cancer Research that focuses on African-American health disparities.  During the past eight years and with funding from the NCI, the two institutions have firmly established the  Partnership by building on complementary instituflonal strengths, conducting joint planning in molecular  cancer research, population-based research and training of junior faculty and students. The Partnership now  proposes to expand these iniflaflves through an NCI-funded Cooperative Planning Grant (U54) for  Comprehensive Partnerships to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities. Our objecflves are: (1) To expand  research collaborations among the two institutions; (2) To use research activities in and outside the U54  mechanism to train students and junior/mid-level faculty in mulfldisciplinary research aimed at reducing  cancer disparities; and (3) To expand and consolidate programs of community outreach and education. The  strengths of each institution are uniquely posifloned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to  achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: 3 full projects in basic  cancer research, one full and two pilot projects in community outreach, one minority training project, and one  shared resource to enhance NCCU infrastructure and the partnership. The extensive expertise, and  resources of LCCC in cancer research and cancer education training, the demonstrated interest in minority  health disparities and the experience of NCCU in reaching minority populaflons, faculty and students, are  complementary institutional strengths that will help the Partnership: 1) establish an effective cancer research  infrastructure/program and increase training opportunities at a minority serving institution; and 2) enhance  community- and populaflon-based research targeting minority cancer-related health disparities and increase  training ef minority scienflsts at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  African-Americans suffer a disproportionate share ofthe cancer burden, with overall cancer mortality rate  averaging one third higher than Caucasian Americans. Furthermore, for cancers such as prostate or cervical  cancer where treatment can be effective, the rates of treatment failure or recurrence are higher in African  Americans.

"1/2 Howard/Hopkins Intercenter Collaboration in HPV-Associated Cancer Studies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to improve the translational and community-based HPV-associated cancer research, education, and training at Howard University through collaborative projects and an effective long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. Human papillomavirus (HPV) accounts for 5.2% of cancer cases worldwide. Several strains of HPV cause a variety of devastating reproductive and oropharyngeal cancers. In the United States, about 26,700 cases of HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually. African American women suffer from a significantly higher incidence rate of HPV-associated cervical, vaginal, and anal cancers compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Additionally, HPV-16 has been identified in approximately 20-30% of head and neck cancers and roughly 56% of oropharynx and oral cavity cancers. Howard University Medical Institutions have a historically Black student body, and its medical and dental facilities participate in direct service to minority populations. However, Howard University faces significant challenges in cancer research and health disparities efforts. Johns Hopkins is committed to providing mentorship and educational resources in cancer research to improve Howard's capacities. Howard is a leading minority-serving institution, while Johns Hopkins is a well-established NCI-designated Cancer Center. An educational effort that brings together Howard doctors and dentists who focus on minorities and Johns Hopkins researchers who study HPV-related cancers will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions. Through a set of collaborative pilot projects that include HPV vaccine development in mice models, epidemiology research in a Washington D.C. community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network between the two universities, this collaboration will significantly enhance career development, education, and competitiveness in seeking funding opportunities for Howard students and educators. Specific aims will be: 1) to support collaborative cancer research projects between the Howard University Medical Institutions and the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins; 2) to provide collaborative training and mentoring programs for promoting Howard medical and dental students and faculty in cancer research, 3) to establish education programs that advance the knowledge of cancer research as it applies to etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV-associated cancer in the context of minority-serving institutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research.

"1/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to establish a Partnership between Alabama State University (ASU) and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved African American population, has goals of attaining excellence in research focused on cancer health disparities. The two institutions possess unique strengths that supplement each other. At ASU, which is classified as a historically black college and university (HBCU), more than 90% of students and more than 60% of the faculty belong to an underserved minority community in which health disparities are a significant issue in various areas, including cancer. The UAB CCC, in contrast, has developed an extensive infrastructure and critical mass of scientists that are necessary for a sustained research program. Still, ASU has a cultural sensitivity and perspective that may be deficient in the UAB CCC. Thus, the partners will facilitate collaborations in cancer-related research, training (career development), and education to aid this underserved community. UAB CCC faculty/scientists will cooperate with faculty and students at ASU and thereby initiate cancer research programs, creating an conduit for ASU faculty and students to pursue cancer research programs. The proposed effort will engage underserved groups by providing advanced research in prostate and colorectal cancer (both of which are major cancer health disparities for African Americans), by providing training to students and faculty members and by introducing topics related to cancer health disparities into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at ASU. The proposed Partnership has an Administrative Core, a Cancer Research Program with two functioning projects, and a Cancer Training and Education Program. Within the Administrative Core, there are Bioethics Support, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Support, and Evaluation Support. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee, which will consist of two distinguished scientists of each institution; an Executive Committee with members of both institutions; and, for each organization, a Partnership Institutional Committee. The Cancer Training and Education Program will reach talented students and faculty at ASU, linking them to established investigators and to the research infrastructure at the UAB CCC, and facilitate faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student and education in the area of cancer research in order to increase the number of minority investigators involved in cancer research. The goal of the Bioethics support will be to provide exceptional bioethics education, training, guidance, and consultation throughout the Partnership. The goal of the Biostatistics/Bioinformatics support will be to address the statistical/bioinformatics needs of the research projects sponsored by the Partnership. The specific aims for the Partnership are: (1) to enhance, by development of junior faculty members, the research and administrative infrastructure to conduct competitive basic and community-based cancer research at ASU; (2) to develop investigators committed to research in cancer disparities at both partnering institutions; and (3) to establish a pipeline of minority cancer disparity researchers and health professionals between ASU and UAB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed partnership between Alabama State University (ASU), a Historically Black Colleges and University and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC) builds upon current efforts to establish collaborative research infrastructure between the two institutions. Each organization possesses a unique set of strengths that effectively cover inherent weaknesses of the other. Of note, the Partnership is geographically located within the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African American population. Since this Partnership seeks to eliminate the gaps in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality between Whites and Blacks, the demographic characteristics of the available study population are relevant.            ",1/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership,8849778,P20CA192973,"['Alabama ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heart ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Caucasians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Training and Education ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Population Study ', ' outreach ', ' Research Ethics ', ' career development ', ' cancer care ', ' Drops ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Basic Cancer Research ', ' Core Facility ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,P20,2014,191836,0.08753092354709444
"UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) The overall goal of this collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU), a minority-serving institution, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), a comprehensive cancer center, is to expand the current regional cancer program at NMSU and to increase knowledge and attention to cancer related health disparities at FHCRC and NMSU. Three specific aims will help us achieve our overall goal: 1.To conduct a diverse portfolio of cancer research projects. We will use the same structured development and rigorous review process to select new projects during the five-year award. 2. To maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective training programs for current and future underserved scientists. A new core will integrate all training components. 3. To implement cancer-related public health interventions in underserved communities. As part of this aim, we will conduct research and disseminate evidence-based practices. This proposal begins with a section elucidating the overall objectives and partnership integration of the proposal. We discuss our goals and objectives, our planning, and especially our progress in the current U54. This is followed by an Administrative Core (Core B) that describes the leadership of the two institutions and the mechanism for ensuring junior faculty have sufficient mentorship to move to senior positions. Our Planning and Evaluation Core (Core C) outlines the rigorous procedures we have in place for evaluating current and future projects. The Development Core (Core D) includes two pilot projects and two full projects. Our new Integrated Training and Evaluation Core (Core E) seeks to provide numerous opportunities for ongoing training and meticulous evaluation of those training activities. The Outreach Core (Core F) focuses on training medical residents and health care providers, an academic-community partnership, and outreach through Community Health Educators who will collaborate with the County Extension Service to provide evidence-based interventions to community members. A logic model indicates how the pieces come together to have significant impact on both cancer research and cancer disparities.

"MMC, VICC & TSU:  Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 2 of 3) Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC), Tennessee State University (TSU) and Vanderbilt-lngram Cancer Center (VICC) resulting in this formal Cancer Partnership. Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants of the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU:  Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 2 of 3)",8724431,U54CA163072,"['Age ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chemistry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' nanotech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' nano scale Science ', ' Nanoscale Science ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U54,2014,1305196,0.1388553331135533
"Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership The overall objective of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparities. This is being achieved through our programs of Cancer Research, Cancer Training, Cancer Education, Cancer Outreach, Bioethics, and Biostatistics, which are leading to sustained, integrated, organizational changes at the three Institutions. Significant milestones have been reached.  At MSM, a Cancer Research Program (CRP) was established In 2007 by developing an organizational framework for the previously disconnected cancer research scientists and teams. The program consists of four sections, Basic Science Research, Community and Epidemiological Research, Clinical Trials Exploratory, and  Research Training and Career Development. Thirty faculty members from diverse scientific disciplines are associated with the CRP. In parallel, TU has demonstrated increased capacity to conduct research on cancerhealth disparities by training and garnering a critical mass of scientists who focus on reducing and eliminating  these disparities. In 2005, 7 scientists at TU were involved in some aspect of cancer research, compared to 17 in 2010. With the central teaching mission of Tuskegee, the training of 9 undergraduates and 22 graduate students in cancer research since 2005 demonstrates TU's ability to establish a pipeline of prospective minority  investigators who are focusing on cancer research. This growth in health disparity research and education led  to the creation, in December 2010, of the Health Disparities Institute for Research and Education (HDIRE) at TU. Dr. Roberta Troy, Co-PI on the U54 Partnership, was appointed as its founding director. The HDIRE has as its mission the elimination and/or mitigation of health disparities through research, education, and training,  and through advocacy of policies relevant to underserved populations, particularly in the Black Belt region of Alabama. The UAB CCC has similarly expanded its capacity to conduct cancer health disparities research. In the past 5 years, UAB has recruited 6 new faculty members involved in such research.  Each of the institutions has had increases in cancer research funding, indicating scientific productivity. At MSM, S8M was secured in 2000 to support cancer research. By 2005, cancer research funding increased to $18M, and, by 2010, to $26M. Similarly, cancer research funding increased at TU, exceeding $6M in 2010. At  the UAB CCC, there was an increase in annual funding from $12M in 2005 to $22M by 2010 in its Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program. This increase was mostly related to research on cancer disparities.  While the evaluation of each of the cores and programs is detailed in the respective sections, it is appropriate to highlight some of the achievements. The Developmental Research Proaram continues to be strengthened and to produce competitive and productive investigators. Since its inception, 10 pilot projects and 1 full project have been awarded, and all but one pilot have been or are being successfully conducted. As of December 2010, 17 peer-reviewed publications directly related to the goals of U54 have been generated, a remarkable increase from 1 publication in 2008. Additionally, investigators of this Partnership have published 75 peer-reviewed manuscripts that are directly related to cancer disparities (see Appendix A-C). Over the past 5 years, the Cancer Training Program has trained 81 scholars (28 junior faculty and 53 graduate students) to perform cancer-related research. While 61% of the scholars have extramural funding, 21% have secured additional extramural funding since completing the program.), and 43% of them have published manuscripts.  The Cancer Education Program, which is essential for ensuring a pipeline of well-trained students who elect to pursue research in cancer health disparities and related professions, has developed a cancer-related course (Foundations of Cancer Biology) that has been incorporated and sustained as part of the TU curriculum.  Recently, Cancer Education Co-Leaders and Bioethics Shared Resource members of the Partnership have developed and offered a Health Disparities, Bioethics, and Policy course at TU.  The Cancer Outreach Programs, based on the community health advisor model, have achieved their medium-term outcomes. Through a relationship with the Department of Public Health, the MSM program disseminated an intervention for colon cancer screening in the greater Atlanta area. UAB's Cancer Outreach Program increased participation of African Americans in cancer therapeutic trials, with 180 referrals to the  program and 124 cancer survivors enrolling in their IMPACT program. At TU, outreach efforts led to a program addressing healthy lifestyles among rural residents, with participants increasing physical activity and making improved dietary choices. Bioethics activities continue to be highly rated within the Partnership and by other collaborators. As essential resources, Biostatistics and Bioethics are integrated throughout the Partnership.

"Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership The overall objective of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparities. This is being achieved through our programs of Cancer Research, Cancer Training, Cancer Education, Cancer Outreach, Bioethics, and Biostatistics, which are leading to sustained, integrated, organizational changes at the three Institutions. Significant milestones have been reached.  At MSM, a Cancer Research Program (CRP) was established In 2007 by developing an organizational framework for the previously disconnected cancer research scientists and teams. The program consists of four sections, Basic Science Research, Community and Epidemiological Research, Clinical Trials Exploratory, and  Research Training and Career Development. Thirty faculty members from diverse scientific disciplines are associated with the CRP. In parallel, TU has demonstrated increased capacity to conduct research on cancerhealth disparities by training and garnering a critical mass of scientists who focus on reducing and eliminating  these disparities. In 2005, 7 scientists at TU were involved in some aspect of cancer research, compared to 17 in 2010. With the central teaching mission of Tuskegee, the training of 9 undergraduates and 22 graduate students in cancer research since 2005 demonstrates TU's ability to establish a pipeline of prospective minority  investigators who are focusing on cancer research. This growth in health disparity research and education led  to the creation, in December 2010, of the Health Disparities Institute for Research and Education (HDIRE) at TU. Dr. Roberta Troy, Co-PI on the U54 Partnership, was appointed as its founding director. The HDIRE has as its mission the elimination and/or mitigation of health disparities through research, education, and training,  and through advocacy of policies relevant to underserved populations, particularly in the Black Belt region of Alabama. The UAB CCC has similarly expanded its capacity to conduct cancer health disparities research. In the past 5 years, UAB has recruited 6 new faculty members involved in such research.  Each of the institutions has had increases in cancer research funding, indicating scientific productivity. At MSM, S8M was secured in 2000 to support cancer research. By 2005, cancer research funding increased to $18M, and, by 2010, to $26M. Similarly, cancer research funding increased at TU, exceeding $6M in 2010. At  the UAB CCC, there was an increase in annual funding from $12M in 2005 to $22M by 2010 in its Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program. This increase was mostly related to research on cancer disparities.  While the evaluation of each of the cores and programs is detailed in the respective sections, it is appropriate to highlight some of the achievements. The Developmental Research Proaram continues to be strengthened and to produce competitive and productive investigators. Since its inception, 10 pilot projects and 1 full project have been awarded, and all but one pilot have been or are being successfully conducted. As of December 2010, 17 peer-reviewed publications directly related to the goals of U54 have been generated, a remarkable increase from 1 publication in 2008. Additionally, investigators of this Partnership have published 75 peer-reviewed manuscripts that are directly related to cancer disparities (see Appendix A-C). Over the past 5 years, the Cancer Training Program has trained 81 scholars (28 junior faculty and 53 graduate students) to perform cancer-related research. While 61% of the scholars have extramural funding, 21% have secured additional extramural funding since completing the program.), and 43% of them have published manuscripts.  The Cancer Education Program, which is essential for ensuring a pipeline of well-trained students who elect to pursue research in cancer health disparities and related professions, has developed a cancer-related course (Foundations of Cancer Biology) that has been incorporated and sustained as part of the TU curriculum.  Recently, Cancer Education Co-Leaders and Bioethics Shared Resource members of the Partnership have developed and offered a Health Disparities, Bioethics, and Policy course at TU.  The Cancer Outreach Programs, based on the community health advisor model, have achieved their medium-term outcomes. Through a relationship with the Department of Public Health, the MSM program disseminated an intervention for colon cancer screening in the greater Atlanta area. UAB's Cancer Outreach Program increased participation of African Americans in cancer therapeutic trials, with 180 referrals to the  program and 124 cancer survivors enrolling in their IMPACT program. At TU, outreach efforts led to a program addressing healthy lifestyles among rural residents, with participants increasing physical activity and making improved dietary choices. Bioethics activities continue to be highly rated within the Partnership and by other collaborators. As essential resources, Biostatistics and Bioethics are integrated throughout the Partnership.  In summary, consistent with the outcomes outlined in our Evaluation Framework developed for the previous application, our tripartite Partnership has achieved short and medium-term outcomes and is now realizing long-term outcomes, including integrated, organizational changes at each of the institutions.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"Charles Drew University/UCLA Cancer Center Partnership to Eliminate Cancer Health The proposed partnership between Charles Drew University (CDU) and UCLA Jonsson Cancer Center seeks to ""Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities in Minority and Underserved Populations"". This objective will continue to strengthen the CDU cancer research and training infrastructure by enhancing the participation of minority students, fellows and faculty engaged in Cancer Research, Training, and Cancer Outreach. The partnership will continue to recruit new faculty with career focus in cancer research, education or outreach.  Likewise, UCLA and the investigators in the JCCC will have the important opportunity to address, issues related to the unequal burden of cancer in minority populations. The partnership developed during our U56 funding has made a significant impact on our ability to develop strong pilots and partnership programs. A key new and important addition to our U54 program is the development of strong Cancer Outreach Program and Projects. Thereby, we will train more minority investigators addressing issues in cancer research, education, training and outcome in our communities. In view of the rapidly changing demographics of Los Angeles and the state of California, the CDU-UCLA Partnership is ideally situated and will have an opportunity to have a positive impact on reducing cancer incidence and improving survival in minority and underserved populations. The overarching goals of the CDU-UCLA Cancer Partnership Program are to significantly increase the number of minority scientists in cancer research and to enhance the cancer outreach programs at CDU to address significant disparities in cancer among minority populations. Supported and implemented by an Administrative Core, Planning and Evaluation Core, and Developmental Core, the basic program components are 1) research projects; 2) the mentoring of students and junior investigators; 3) the training seminar series; 4) enhance CDU's integrated clinical and tissue biorepository data base on minority suubjects; 5) enhance community participation; 6) improve our clinical trials resource; and 7) increase faculty recruitment. We plan to submit 2 full projects and 2 pilot projects.

"Morehouse School of Med/Tuskegee U/UAB Comp. Cancer Center Partnership    PROJECT SUMMARY (See instructions): This application is for continuation of the existing partnership between Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC). The three institutions, each serving a community with major black-white racial disparities, possess unique sets of strengths that complement each other. The primary objectives are to maintain progress in establishment of effective cancer research programs at MSM and TU and to persist In developing a pipeline of prospective minority Investigators at TU. The Partnership, with four effective Research Programs In education, research, career progression, and cancer outreach, will continue: 1) to tap the pool of talented students and faculty currently at MSM and TU through an effective Research Training and Career Development (RTCD) Program, linking them to established investigators and to the research Infrastructure at the UABCCC; 2) to promote a Developmental Research Program, which provides funding opportunities to conduct research projects in parallel to the RTCD Program; 3) to encourage postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates across scientific disciplines to pursue careers in the biosciences through our Cancer Education Program and to provide a pipeline into our RTCD and Developmental Research Programs; and, 4) through our established Community Outreach (now Cancer Outreach) Program, to promote cancer screening and healthy lifestyles among our most underserved populations and increase minority participation in therapeutic clinical trials. The partnership has two Interactive Shared Resources: 1) The Bioethics Shared Resource promotes and ensures adherence to bioethical principles and addresses ethical considerations in relationships between majority and minority institutions and between institutions and underserved communities; and 2) The Biostatistics Shared Resource maintains statistical support to all programs ofthe Partnership. With continued accomplishments, this partnership will provide the UABCCC, MSM, and TU with an enhanced capability to conduct research on cancer health disparities.

"Xavier RCMI Center for Cancer Research      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since its inception in 2009, Xavier University's RCIVII Center for Cancer Research has been a driving force toward achieving the University's goal of becoming a national leader in cancer and health disparities research. We propose five alms in order to move closer to attaining this goal. (1) Strengthen internal and external collaborations and partnerships, particularly those that promote health disparities and translational research: building on existing collaborations with LSU, LSU Health Sciences Center, Tulane University and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center through active partnerships in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium and the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network, we will leverage research and mentoring resources in place and establish new ones via partnerships formed within Xavier and between Xavier and RTRN institutions. (2) Reorganize and enhance critical core facilities: we will down size one existing core, create a new core in drug discovery and delivery and add -a bioinformatics facility to our existing Cell and Molecular Biology Core. (3) Increase Xavier's pool of competitive and productive cancer and health disparities researchers who participate in the translational research ""pipeline:"" we will retain previously hired, now competitive, RCMI faculty, hire additional promising junior faculty in critical ""gap"" areas that will improve our capabilities in health disparities and translational research, and provide these faculty with the resources necessary to become/remain competitive. (4)Establish a new pilot project program for cancer/health disparities research: we will use a peer-reviewed mechanism to select projects that will increase Xavier NIH R01 and other R-series grants and support pilot translational research projects for preliminary data collection. (5) Provide targeted administrative services in support of RCMI investigators: we will assure that faculty needs are met with minimal burden, research programs and core services are integrated and encourage teamwork, and that faculty development programs promote professional growth and engagement in health disparities and translational research. Successfully completing these aims will be significant because it will increase the pool of researchers who can more quickly translate bench discoveries into public benefit, particularly in minority communities. The research projects supported by the present RCMI proposal will be innovative as we propose to utilize a programmatic structure involving partnerships with major research universities, an NIH-supported Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities and an NIH-funded center for translational sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer remains a major public health problem, especially among African Americans. Across the U.S., and particularly in Louisiana, the number of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths is significantly higher in African Americans than Caucasians.

Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center.             Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants of the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research  infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 1 of 3)",8730566,U54CA163069,"['Age ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chemistry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' nanotech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' nano scale Science ', ' Nanoscale Science ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Commit ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U54,2014,1296878,0.1388553331135533

"MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research The American Association for Cancer Research requests renewal of support for the project entitled ?MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research.? The funds provide scholar awards to support the attendance of full-time faculty from Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) at highcaliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multilevel program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of under-representation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. The broad objective of the project is to increase the oncological knowledge base and participation of faculty from Minority-Serving Institutions in cancer research. MSIs encompass Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges & Universities (TCUs). Awardees receive funds for travel, hotel, subsistence, and registration fees in conjunction with their attendance at the AACR Annual Meeting or an AACR Special Conference. Their attendance at the Annual Meeting exposes them to the broad range of ongoing cancer research in basic, translational, and clinical areas, and at the Special Conferences, allows them to participate in those scientific sessions that are especially relevant to their research interests and professional growth. The project also aims to facilitate the MSI Faculty Scholars? professional relationships and networking possibilities with national and international cancer researchers, and to further their careers and enhance their recognition by professional peers through providing the opportunity to present and discuss their own research findings before national audiences. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Beyond the direct benefits to Awardees, the program has potentially wider implications for the  health status of the minority population in general, resulting from the formation of a larger pool of  experienced minority basic cancer researchers and clinicians. First, the enhancement of the MSI  faculty member�s research program enriches the experience of the minority students he or she  trains. Second, minority investigators are more likely to explore the issues relating to minority  health disparities, as well as to have a better prospect of recruiting and collaborating with minority  study subjects, and a significant increase in the number and visibility of minority cancer researchers  might serve as an effective antidote to attitudes of distrust on the part of study participants and  help lead to greater trust on the part of minorities in the medical and research establishment.",MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research,8706809,R13CA076526,"['Theriacs ', ' Antidotes ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Fees ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' career ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' programs ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Participant ', ' peer ', ' member ', ' Study Subject ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' Population Sciences ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' minority health ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' tribal university ', ' tribal college ', ' Population ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2014,74999,0.05921557156485684
"Charles Drew University/UCLA Cancer Center Partnership to Eliminate Cancer Health The proposed partnership between Charles Drew University (CDU) and UCLA Jonsson Cancer Center seeks to ""Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities in iVIinority and Underserved Populations"". This objective will continue to strengthen the CDU cancer research and training infrastructure by enhancing the participation of minority students, fellows and faculty engaged in Cancer Research, Training, and Cancer Outreach. The partnership will continue to recruit new faculty with career focus in cancer research, education or outreach. Likewise, UCLA and the investigators in the JCCC will have the important opportunity to address, issues related to the unequal burden of cancer in minority populations. The partnership developed during our U56 funding has made a significant impact on our ability to develop strong pilots and partnership programs. A key new and important addition to our U54 program is the development of strong Cancer Outreach Program and Projects. Thereby, we will train more minority investigators addressing issues in cancer research, education, training and outcome iri our communities. In view of the rapidly changing demographics of Los Angeles and the state of California, the CDU-UCLA Partnership is ideally situated and will have an opportunity to have a positive impact on reducing cancer incidence and improving survival in minority and underserved populations. The overarching goals of the CDU-UCLA Cancer Partnership Program are to significantly increase the number of minority scientists in cancer research and to enhance the cancer outreach programs at CDU to address significant disparities in cancer among minority populations. Supported and implemented by an Administrative Core, Planning and Evaluation Core, and Developmental Core, the basic program components are 1) research projects; 2) the mentoring of students and junior investigators; 3) the training seminar series; 4) enhance CDU's integrated clinical and tissue biorepository data base on minority subjects; 5) enhance community participation; 6) improve our clinical trials resource; and 7) increase faculty recruitment. We plan to submit 2 full projects and 2 pilot projects.

"UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) The overall goal of this collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU), a minority-serving institution, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), a comprehensive cancer center, is to expand the current regional cancer program at NMSU and to increase knowledge and attention to cancer related health disparities at FHCRC and NMSU. Three specific aims will help us achieve our overall goal: 1.To conduct a diverse portfolio of cancer research projects. We will use the same structured development and rigorous review process to select new projects during the five-year award. 2. To maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective training programs for current and future underserved scientists. A new core will integrate all training components. 3. To implement cancer-related public health interventions in underserved communities. As part of this aim, we will conduct research and disseminate evidence-based practices. This proposal begins with a section elucidating the overall objectives and partnership integration of the proposal. We discuss our goals and objectives, our planning, and especially our progress in the current U54. This is followed by an Administrative Core (Core B) that describes the leadership of the two institutions and the mechanism for ensuring junior faculty have sufficient mentorship to move to senior positions. Our Planning and Evaluation Core (Core C) outlines the rigorous procedures we have in place for evaluating current and future projects. The Development Core (Core D) includes two pilot projects and two full projects. Our new Integrated Training and Evaluation Core (Core E) seeks to provide numerous opportunities for ongoing training and meticulous evaluation of those training activities. The Outreach Core (Core F) focuses on training medical residents and health care providers, an academic-community partnership, and outreach through Community Health Educators who will collaborate with the County Extension Service to provide evidence-based interventions to community members. A logic model indicates how the pieces come together to have significant impact on both cancer research and cancer disparities. This collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research  Center (FHCRC) seeks to build and enhance cancer research at NMSU, increase attention to health  disparities at the FHCRC, train underrepresented students as well as junior faculty to fill cancer research  positions throughout the nation, and provide outreach on cancer awareness and education to New Mexico.",Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2),8916511,U54CA132383,"['Attention ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Leadership ', ' Logic ', ' Mentorship ', ' New Mexico ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Public Health ', ' public health medicine (field) ', ' Research ', ' Students ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Services ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Intervention ', ' Health Educators ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' ']",NCI,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,U54,2014,64354,0.1461737609487739

"(2/2) Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to improve the translational and community-based HPV-associated cancer research, education, and training at Howard University through collaborative projects and an effective long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. Human papillomavirus (HPV) accounts for 5.2% of cancer cases worldwide. Several strains of HPV cause a variety of devastating reproductive and oropharyngeal cancers. In the United States, about 26,700 cases of HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually. African American women suffer from a significantly higher incidence rate of HPV-associated cervical, vaginal, and anal cancers compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Additionally, HPV-16 has been identified in approximately 20-30% of head and neck cancers and roughly 56% of oropharynx and oral cavity cancers. Howard University Medical Institutions have a historically Black student body, and its medical and dental facilities participate in direct service to minority populations. However, Howard University faces significant challenges in cancer research and health disparities efforts. Johns Hopkins is committed to providing mentorship and educational resources in cancer research to improve Howard's capacities. Howard is a leading minority-serving institution, while Johns Hopkins is a well-established NCI-designated Cancer Center. An educational effort that brings together Howard doctors and dentists who focus on minorities and Johns Hopkins researchers who study HPV-related cancers will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions. Through a set of collaborative pilot projects that include HPV vaccine development in mice models, epidemiology research in a Washington D.C. community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network between the two universities, this collaboration will significantly enhance career development, education, and competitiveness in seeking funding opportunities for Howard students and educators. Specific aims will be: 1) to support collaborative cancer research projects between the Howard University Medical Institutions and the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins; 2) to provide collaborative training and mentoring programs for promoting Howard medical and dental students and faculty in cancer research, 3) to establish education programs that advance the knowledge of cancer research as it applies to etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV-associated cancer in the context of minority-serving institutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research.  This effective, long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center features collaborative pilot projects such as HPV vaccine development, epidemiology research in a community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network to improve the translational and community-based cancer health research capabilities of Howard University. Data from the projects will contribute to publications and competitive grant applications for Howard University scientists, and the overall collaboration will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions in the Washington D.C./Baltimore metropolitan area.            ",(2/2) Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research,8850082,P20CA192988,"['Accounting ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Baltimore ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' dental health care facility ', ' Dental Facilities ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC), Tennessee State University (TSU) and Vanderbilt-lngram Cancer Center (VICC) resulting in this formal Cancer Partnership. Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center.             RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants ofthe disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival.

"Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer The American Association for Cancer Research requests renewal of support for the project entitled ?Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer.? The funds provide scholar awards to support the attendance of young scientists from NIH-recognized minority populations at highcaliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multilevel program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of under-representation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. Predoctoral (graduate and medical) students, clinical and postdoctoral fellows, residents, and junior investigators, who are either engaged in cancer research or have the training and the potential to make contributions in the field, are eligible for the award. It also applies only to minority groups that have been defined by the NCI as being traditionally underrepresented in cancer and biomedical research: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, Hispanic or Latino Americans, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. Awardees receive funds for travel, hotel, subsistence, and registration fees in conjunction with their attendance at the AACR Annual Meeting or an AACR Special Conference. Their attendance at one of these meetings exposes them to the full spectrum of high-quality cancer research being performed nationally and internationally, and buttresses their knowledge base in the cancer field. The project also aims to increase the number of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and biomedical science, to contribute to the research training and networking opportunities of young minority investigators in the cancer field, and to facilitate relationships between young minority scientists and senior investigators in the field, who may function as mentors and thereby contribute to the career development and professional success of young scientists as cancer researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Beyond the direct benefits to Awardees, the program has potentially wider implications for the  health status of the minority population in general, resulting from the formation of a larger pool of  minority cancer researchers and clinicians. This is because a wider pool of researchers will not only  train and inspire the next generations of minority researchers, but also further explore issues  relating to minority health disparities. In addition, Minority researchers have a better prospect of  recruiting and collaborating with minority study subjects, and a significant increase in the number  and visibility of minority cancer researchers might serve as an effective antidote to attitudes of  distrust on the part of study participants and help lead to greater trust on the part of minorities in  the medical and research establishment.",Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer,8706807,R13CA040577,"['Theriacs ', ' Antidotes ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Fees ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Medical Students ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Training and Education ', ' American ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaska Native ', ' career development ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' minority health ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2014,74999,0.09704068202503162
"NCCU-LCCC Partrnership in Cancer Research (1 of 2) The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at  the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) propose to continue an effective, sustainable, and  mutually beneficial partnership in Cancer Research that focuses on African-American health disparities.  During the past eight years and with funding from the NCI, the two institutions have firmly established the  Partnership by building on complementary instituflonal strengths, conducting joint planning in molecular  cancer research, population-based research and training of junior faculty and students. The Partnership now  proposes to expand these iniflaflves through an NCI-funded Cooperative Planning Grant (U54) for  Comprehensive Partnerships to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities. Our objecflves are: (1) To expand  research collaborations among the two institutions; (2) To use research activities in and outside the U54  mechanism to train students and junior/mid-level faculty in mulfldisciplinary research aimed at reducing  cancer disparities; and (3) To expand and consolidate programs of community outreach and education. The  strengths of each institution are uniquely posifloned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to  achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: 3 full projects in basic  cancer research, one full and two pilot projects in community outreach, one minority training project, and one  shared resource to enhance NCCU infrastructure and the partnership. The extensive expertise, and  resources of LCCC in cancer research and cancer education training, the demonstrated interest in minority  health disparities and the experience of NCCU in reaching minority populaflons, faculty and students, are  complementary institutional strengths that will help the Partnership: 1) establish an effective cancer research  infrastructure/program and increase training opportunities at a minority serving institution; and 2) enhance  community- and populaflon-based research targeting minority cancer-related health disparities and increase  training ef minority scienflsts at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  African-Americans suffer a disproportionate share ofthe cancer burden, with overall cancer mortality rate  averaging one third higher than Caucasian Americans. Furthermore, for cancers such as prostate or cervical  cancer where treatment can be effective, the rates of treatment failure or recurrence are higher in African  Americans.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) The overall goal of this collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU), a minority-serving institution, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), a comprehensive cancer center, is to expand the current regional cancer program at NMSU and to increase knowledge and attention to cancer related health disparities at FHCRC and NMSU. Three specific aims will help us achieve our overall goal: 1.To conduct a diverse portfolio of cancer research projects. We will use the same structured development and rigorous review process to select new projects during the five-year award. 2. To maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective training programs for current and future underserved scientists. A new core will integrate all training components. 3. To implement cancer-related public health interventions in underserved communities. As part of this aim, we will conduct research and disseminate evidence-based practices. This proposal begins with a section elucidating the overall objectives and partnership integration of the proposal. We discuss our goals and objectives, our planning, and especially our progress in the current U54. This is followed by an Administrative Core (Core B) that describes the leadership of the two institutions and the mechanism for ensuring junior faculty have sufficient mentorship to move to senior positions. Our Planning and Evaluation Core (Core C) outlines the rigorous procedures we have in place for evaluating current and future projects. The Development Core (Core D) includes two pilot projects and two full projects. Our new Integrated Training and Evaluation Core (Core E) seeks to provide numerous opportunities for ongoing training and meticulous evaluation of those training activities.

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC), Tennessee State University (TSU) and Vanderbilt-lngram Cancer Center (VICC) resulting in this formal Cancer Partnership. Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. RELEVANCE (See instructions):  Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants ofthe disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research  infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)",9133778,U54CA163066,"['Age ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chemistry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' nanotech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' nano scale Science ', ' Nanoscale Science ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2015,230858,0.1371329293323763
"Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer The American Association for Cancer Research requests renewal of support for the project entitled ?Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer.? The funds provide scholar awards to support the attendance of young scientists from NIH-recognized minority populations at highcaliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multilevel program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of under-representation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. Predoctoral (graduate and medical) students, clinical and postdoctoral fellows, residents, and junior investigators, who are either engaged in cancer research or have the training and the potential to make contributions in the field, are eligible for the award. It also applies only to minority groups that have been defined by the NCI as being traditionally underrepresented in cancer and biomedical research: African-Americans, Alaskan Natives, Hispanic or Latino Americans, Native Americans, and Native Pacific Islanders. Awardees receive funds for travel, hotel, subsistence, and registration fees in conjunction with their attendance at the AACR Annual Meeting or an AACR Special Conference. Their attendance at one of these meetings exposes them to the full spectrum of high-quality cancer research being performed nationally and internationally, and buttresses their knowledge base in the cancer field. The project also aims to increase the number of minority scientists and physicians working in cancer research and biomedical science, to contribute to the research training and networking opportunities of young minority investigators in the cancer field, and to facilitate relationships between young minority scientists and senior investigators in the field, who may function as mentors and thereby contribute to the career development and professional success of young scientists as cancer researchers. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE STATEMENT  Beyond the direct benefits to Awardees, the program has potentially wider implications for the  health status of the minority population in general, resulting from the formation of a larger pool of  minority cancer researchers and clinicians. This is because a wider pool of researchers will not only  train and inspire the next generations of minority researchers, but also further explore issues  relating to minority health disparities. In addition, Minority researchers have a better prospect of  recruiting and collaborating with minority study subjects, and a significant increase in the number  and visibility of minority cancer researchers might serve as an effective antidote to attitudes of  distrust on the part of study participants and help lead to greater trust on the part of minorities in  the medical and research establishment.",Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer,9132915,R13CA040577,"['Theriacs ', ' Antidotes ', ' Attitude ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Fees ', ' Level of Health ', ' Health Status ', ' Institutes ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Physicians ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Science ', ' Medical Students ', ' Travel ', ' Work ', ' Medical Research ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' Clinical ', ' Training ', ' Trust ', ' Pacific Islander American ', ' Pacific Islander ', ' Pacific Island Americans ', ' Funding ', ' Native Americans ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Training and Education ', ' American ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' Participant ', ' Study Subject ', ' Native Alaskan ', ' Alaskan Native ', ' Alaskan Indian ', ' Alaskan American ', ' Alaskan ', ' Alaska Indian ', ' Alaska Native ', ' career development ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' Senior Scientist ', ' minority health ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' predoctoral ', ' predoc ', ' pre-doc ', ' pre-doctoral ', ' public health relevance ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2015,45000,0.09704068202503162

"2/2 NCCU-LCCC Partnership in Cancer Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Abstract: The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) will continue their effective and mutually beneficial partnership focusing on African-American health disparities. During the past 13 years NCI funding has firmly established the Partnership building on complementary institutional strengths, conducting molecular and population-based cancer research and training of junior faculty and students. This Comprehensive Partnership to Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) application builds upon the foundation already established through the previous U54 funding to meet the challenge of disparities in cancer incidence and mortality in North Carolina and the US through cancer research, education and community outreach. Our goals are to: (1) strengthen cancer research capacity at NCCU providing NCCU scientists mentorship and collaborative opportunities to compete for NCI grants; (2) enrich the capacity of NCCU and LCCC to further explore mechanisms underlying the disproportionate incidence of cancer mortality and morbidity between African Americans and Caucasian Americans, using both molecular and population-based approaches; (3) increase the number of NCCU scientists focused on cancer research as well as the education of minority undergraduate and graduate students in cancer research; (4) increase the faculty at the UNC LCCC focused on minority disparities research; and (5) create long-term collaborations between basic, public health, and translational scientists from NCCU and UNC LCCC. The strengths of each institution are uniquely positioned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: Two full and one pilot projects in community intervention and population science, one full and one pilot project in basic/translational cancer research in diseases with a higher incidence in African Americans, and 3 cores: Outreach, Research Education, and Histopathology. The partnership combines the expertise and resources of LCCC in population/public health sciences emphasizing disparities in North Carolina, genomics, cancer biology and cancer education and NCCU's demonstrated interest and faculty with minority health disparities research particularly in Durham NC, the state-funded NCCU units that allow faculty release from teaching and the emphasis on reaching minority populations and developing the careers of, faculty and students. These complementary institutional strengths will assure that the Partnership builds the infrastructure necessary for a lasting collaborative research, effective community outreach and a substantial contribution to our understanding of minority disparities.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Narrative The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) will continue their effective and mutually beneficial partnership focusing on African-American health disparities.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach.

"Medical Student Summer Program in Integrative Science and Cancer Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Ethnic minorities and underserved populations suffer a disproportionate burden of cancer related morbidity and mortality. Minority investigators may be an important resource to address this disparity, however, there are few highly trained minority cancer researchers equipped to focus on this concern. One strategy to correct this shortage is to mentor undergraduate minority medical students in order to encourage them to pursue careers as cancer researchers. While Meharry Medical College (MMC) is a minority-serving institution whose curriculum has been oriented to primary care, in the last decade it has also focused on training academic research oriented physician scientists. As a result, the NCI awarded a U-54 Partnership Grant to MMC and the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) which was successfully renewed in 2006. MMC also received a Minority Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MCCOP) grant in 2004 which was renewed in 2006. Both of these grants are concentrated on cancer basic science, translational and clinical research and will be used to augment teaching and research opportunities provided by this application. This competing renewal proposal continues our goal of significantly increasing the number of minority medical students who develop and maintain an interest in pursuing a career in cancer research by providing a meaningful short-term cancer research experience in a research intensive environment.             The specific aims are to:    1. Identify and select first year medical students who have expressed a strong research interest in the biomedical, clinical, or epidemiologic aspects of cancer at a minority serving institution, and whose academic records are strong.   2. Match medical students with experienced cancer researchers in an area of shared interest of the students.    3. Facilitate and enhance this short-term research exposure of medical students and cancer researchers by     3.1 providing weekly interactions with Meharry Medical College faculty involved in cancer research to  reinforce the concepts of hypothesis-testing, selecting the optimal experimental strategies, analyzing and  interpreting data and integrating data across the spectrum of research strategies, and   3.2 providing a weekly luncheon where project summaries and data updates are provided in a nurturing  environment.   4. Provide a venue for the dissemination of student research findings among student peers and cancer researchers at the conclusion of the summer and the following spring, in an institution-wide program.    5. Advise and mentor the selected students through the residency match selection process to encourage their identification of research-linked residencies.    6. Track the selected students through residency training and ultimate career choice. Ethnic/racial minority populations suffer a disproportionate burden of cancer. Although underrepresented minority investigators would be an important resource to help eliminate this disparity, few are highly trained in this field. This proposal will address this need by providing short term cancer research programs for medical students enrolled at Meharry Medical College the majority of whom represent ethnic/racial minorities.",Medical Student Summer Program in Integrative Science and Cancer Research,8914516,R25CA102209,"['Academic Training ', ' American Indian ', ' American Indians ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Career Path ', ' Career Choice ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Health ', ' Hematology ', ' Public Hospitals ', ' NAS/IOM ', ' Institute of Medicine ', ' Institute of Medicine (U.S.) ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Ethnic and Racial Minorities ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Physicians ', ' Play ', ' Primary Healthcare ', ' Primary Care ', ' Primary Health Care ', ' Recommendation ', ' Records ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Residencies ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Teaching ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Latino ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Policies ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Native Americans ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' Life ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Clinic ', ' Country ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' peer ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Reporting ', ' Touch ', ' Touch sensation ', ' cancer care ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Data ', ' Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' ASCO ', ' American Society of Clinical Oncology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Update ', ' Process ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,R25,2015,235511,0.08459825888712481
"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of this collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU), a minority-serving institution, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), a comprehensive cancer center, is to expand the current regional cancer program at NMSU and to increase knowledge and attention to cancer related health disparities at FHCRC and NMSU. Three specific aims will help us achieve our overall goal: 1.To conduct a diverse portfolio of cancer research projects. We will use the same structured development and rigorous review process to select new projects during the five-year award. 2. To maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective training programs for current and future underserved scientists. A new core will integrate all training components. 3. To implement cancer-related public health interventions in underserved communities. As part of this aim, we will conduct research and disseminate evidence-based practices. This proposal begins with a section elucidating the overall objectives and partnership integration of the proposal. We discuss our goals and objectives, our planning, and especially our progress in the current U54. This is followed by an Administrative Core (Core B) that describes the leadership of the two institutions and the mechanism for ensuring junior faculty have sufficient mentorship to move to senior positions. Our Planning and Evaluation Core (Core C) outlines the rigorous procedures we have in place for evaluating current and future projects. The Development Core (Core D) includes two pilot projects and two full projects. Our new Integrated Training and Evaluation Core (Core E) seeks to provide numerous opportunities for ongoing training and meticulous evaluation of those training activities.

"1/2 Howard/Hopkins Intercenter Collaboration in HPV-Associated Cancer Studies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to improve the translational and community-based HPV-associated cancer research, education, and training at Howard University through collaborative projects and an effective long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. Human papillomavirus (HPV) accounts for 5.2% of cancer cases worldwide. Several strains of HPV cause a variety of devastating reproductive and oropharyngeal cancers. In the United States, about 26,700 cases of HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually. African American women suffer from a significantly higher incidence rate of HPV-associated cervical, vaginal, and anal cancers compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Additionally, HPV-16 has been identified in approximately 20-30% of head and neck cancers and roughly 56% of oropharynx and oral cavity cancers. Howard University Medical Institutions have a historically Black student body, and its medical and dental facilities participate in direct service to minority populations. However, Howard University faces significant challenges in cancer research and health disparities efforts. Johns Hopkins is committed to providing mentorship and educational resources in cancer research to improve Howard's capacities. Howard is a leading minority-serving institution, while Johns Hopkins is a well-established NCI-designated Cancer Center. An educational effort that brings together Howard doctors and dentists who focus on minorities and Johns Hopkins researchers who study HPV-related cancers will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions. Through a set of collaborative pilot projects that include HPV vaccine development in mice models, epidemiology research in a Washington D.C. community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network between the two universities, this collaboration will significantly enhance career development, education, and competitiveness in seeking funding opportunities for Howard students and educators. Specific aims will be: 1) to support collaborative cancer research projects between the Howard University Medical Institutions and the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins; 2) to provide collaborative training and mentoring programs for promoting Howard medical and dental students and faculty in cancer research, 3) to establish education programs that advance the knowledge of cancer research as it applies to etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV-associated cancer in the context of minority-serving institutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research. This effective, long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center features collaborative pilot projects such as HPV vaccine development, epidemiology research in a community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network to improve the translational and community-based cancer health research capabilities of Howard University. Data from the projects will contribute to publications and competitive grant applications for Howard University scientists, and the overall collaboration will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions in the Washington D.C./Baltimore metropolitan area.            ",1/2 Howard/Hopkins Intercenter Collaboration in HPV-Associated Cancer Studies,8930124,P20CA192989,"['Accounting ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Baltimore ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' dental health care facility ', ' Dental Facilities ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership The overall objective of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparities. This is being achieved through our programs of Cancer Research, Cancer Training, Cancer Education, Cancer Outreach, Bioethics, and Biostatistics, which are leading to sustained, integrated, organizational changes at the three Institutions. Significant milestones have been reached.  At MSM, a Cancer Research Program (CRP) was established In 2007 by developing an organizational framework for the previously disconnected cancer research scientists and teams. The program consists of four sections, Basic Science Research, Community and Epidemiological Research, Clinical Trials Exploratory, and  Research Training and Career Development. Thirty faculty members from diverse scientific disciplines are associated with the CRP. In parallel, TU has demonstrated increased capacity to conduct research on cancerhealth disparities by training and garnering a critical mass of scientists who focus on reducing and eliminating  these disparities. In 2005, 7 scientists at TU were involved in some aspect of cancer research, compared to 17 in 2010. With the central teaching mission of Tuskegee, the training of 9 undergraduates and 22 graduate students in cancer research since 2005 demonstrates TU's ability to establish a pipeline of prospective minority  investigators who are focusing on cancer research. This growth in health disparity research and education led  to the creation, in December 2010, of the Health Disparities Institute for Research and Education (HDIRE) at TU. Dr. Roberta Troy, Co-PI on the U54 Partnership, was appointed as its founding director. The HDIRE has as its mission the elimination and/or mitigation of health disparities through research, education, and training,  and through advocacy of policies relevant to underserved populations, particularly in the Black Belt region of Alabama. The UAB CCC has similarly expanded its capacity to conduct cancer health disparities research. In the past 5 years, UAB has recruited 6 new faculty members involved in such research.  Each of the institutions has had increases in cancer research funding, indicating scientific productivity. At MSM, S8M was secured in 2000 to support cancer research. By 2005, cancer research funding increased to $18M, and, by 2010, to $26M. Similarly, cancer research funding increased at TU, exceeding $6M in 2010. At  the UAB CCC, there was an increase in annual funding from $12M in 2005 to $22M by 2010 in its Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program. This increase was mostly related to research on cancer disparities.  While the evaluation of each of the cores and programs is detailed in the respective sections, it is appropriate to highlight some of the achievements. The Developmental Research Proaram continues to be strengthened and to produce competitive and productive investigators. Since its inception, 10 pilot projects and 1 full project have been awarded, and all but one pilot have been or are being successfully conducted. As of December 2010, 17 peer-reviewed publications directly related to the goals of U54 have been generated, a remarkable increase from 1 publication in 2008. Additionally, investigators of this Partnership have published 75 peer-reviewed manuscripts that are directly related to cancer disparities (see Appendix A-C). Over the past 5 years, the Cancer Training Program has trained 81 scholars (28 junior faculty and 53 graduate students) to perform cancer-related research. While 61% of the scholars have extramural funding, 21% have secured additional extramural funding since completing the program.), and 43% of them have published manuscripts.  The Cancer Education Program, which is essential for ensuring a pipeline of well-trained students who elect to pursue research in cancer health disparities and related professions, has developed a cancer-related course (Foundations of Cancer Biology) that has been incorporated and sustained as part of the TU curriculum.  Recently, Cancer Education Co-Leaders and Bioethics Shared Resource members of the Partnership have developed and offered a Health Disparities, Bioethics, and Policy course at TU.  The Cancer Outreach Programs, based on the community health advisor model, have achieved their medium-term outcomes. Through a relationship with the Department of Public Health, the MSM program disseminated an intervention for colon cancer screening in the greater Atlanta area. UAB's Cancer Outreach Program increased participation of African Americans in cancer therapeutic trials, with 180 referrals to the  program and 124 cancer survivors enrolling in their IMPACT program. At TU, outreach efforts led to a program addressing healthy lifestyles among rural residents, with participants increasing physical activity and making improved dietary choices. Bioethics activities continue to be highly rated within the Partnership and by other collaborators. As essential resources, Biostatistics and Bioethics are integrated throughout the Partnership.  In summary, consistent with the outcomes outlined in our Evaluation Framework developed for the previous application, our tripartite Partnership has achieved short and medium-term outcomes and is now realizing long-term outcomes, including integrated, organizational changes at each of the institutions. These will lead to high-quality research on cancer health disparities, produce well-trained investigators, and reduce cancer disparities.

"UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"1/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to establish a Partnership between Alabama State University (ASU) and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved African American population, has goals of attaining excellence in research focused on cancer health disparities. The two institutions possess unique strengths that supplement each other. At ASU, which is classified as a historically black college and university (HBCU), more than 90% of students and more than 60% of the faculty belong to an underserved minority community in which health disparities are a significant issue in various areas, including cancer. The UAB CCC, in contrast, has developed an extensive infrastructure and critical mass of scientists that are necessary for a sustained research program. Still, ASU has a cultural sensitivity and perspective that may be deficient in the UAB CCC. Thus, the partners will facilitate collaborations in cancer-related research, training (career development), and education to aid this underserved community. UAB CCC faculty/scientists will cooperate with faculty and students at ASU and thereby initiate cancer research programs, creating an conduit for ASU faculty and students to pursue cancer research programs. The proposed effort will engage underserved groups by providing advanced research in prostate and colorectal cancer (both of which are major cancer health disparities for African Americans), by providing training to students and faculty members and by introducing topics related to cancer health disparities into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at ASU. The proposed Partnership has an Administrative Core, a Cancer Research Program with two functioning projects, and a Cancer Training and Education Program. Within the Administrative Core, there are Bioethics Support, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Support, and Evaluation Support. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee, which will consist of two distinguished scientists of each institution; an Executive Committee with members of both institutions; and, for each organization, a Partnership Institutional Committee. The Cancer Training and Education Program will reach talented students and faculty at ASU, linking them to established investigators and to the research infrastructure at the UAB CCC, and facilitate faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student and education in the area of cancer research in order to increase the number of minority investigators involved in cancer research. The goal of the Bioethics support will be to provide exceptional bioethics education, training, guidance, and consultation throughout the Partnership. The goal of the Biostatistics/Bioinformatics support will be to address the statistical/bioinformatics needs of the research projects sponsored by the Partnership. The specific aims for the Partnership are: (1) to enhance, by development of junior faculty members, the research and administrative infrastructure to conduct competitive basic and community-based cancer research at ASU; (2) to develop investigators committed to research in cancer disparities at both partnering institutions; and (3) to establish a pipeline of minority cancer disparity researchers and health professionals between ASU and UAB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed partnership between Alabama State University (ASU), a Historically Black Colleges and University and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC) builds upon current efforts to establish collaborative research infrastructure between the two institutions. Each organization possesses a unique set of strengths that effectively cover inherent weaknesses of the other. Of note, the Partnership is geographically located within the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African American population. Since this Partnership seeks to eliminate the gaps in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality between Whites and Blacks, the demographic characteristics of the available study population are relevant.            ",1/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership,8931939,P20CA192973,"['Alabama ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' healthcare service availability ', ' healthcare service access ', ' healthcare access availability ', ' health services availability ', ' health care service availability ', ' health care service access ', ' health care availability ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Availability of Health Services ', ' Accessibility of health care ', ' Access to Healthcare ', ' Access to Health Care ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heart ', ' Incidence ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Life Style ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Students ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Caucasians ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Organizational Change ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' LOINC Axis 4 System ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Training and Education ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' Population Study ', ' outreach ', ' Research Ethics ', ' career development ', ' cancer care ', ' Drops ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Basic Cancer Research ', ' Core Facility ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center ', ' Characteristics ', ' Molecular ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomic ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Behavioral ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' ethnic minority ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' public health relevance ', ' biomarker ', ' biologic marker ', ' Biological Markers ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,P20,2015,198677,0.08753092354709444
"Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership The overall objective of the MSM/TU/UAB CCC Partnership is to reduce and eliminate cancer health disparities. This is being achieved through our programs of Cancer Research, Cancer Training, Cancer Education, Cancer Outreach, Bioethics, and Biostatistics, which are leading to sustained, integrated, organizational changes at the three Institutions. Significant milestones have been reached.  At MSM, a Cancer Research Program (CRP) was established In 2007 by developing an organizational framework for the previously disconnected cancer research scientists and teams. The program consists of four sections, Basic Science Research, Community and Epidemiological Research, Clinical Trials Exploratory, and  Research Training and Career Development. Thirty faculty members from diverse scientific disciplines are associated with the CRP. In parallel, TU has demonstrated increased capacity to conduct research on cancerhealth disparities by training and garnering a critical mass of scientists who focus on reducing and eliminating  these disparities. In 2005, 7 scientists at TU were involved in some aspect of cancer research, compared to 17 in 2010. With the central teaching mission of Tuskegee, the training of 9 undergraduates and 22 graduate students in cancer research since 2005 demonstrates TU's ability to establish a pipeline of prospective minority  investigators who are focusing on cancer research. This growth in health disparity research and education led  to the creation, in December 2010, of the Health Disparities Institute for Research and Education (HDIRE) at TU. Dr. Roberta Troy, Co-PI on the U54 Partnership, was appointed as its founding director. The HDIRE has as its mission the elimination and/or mitigation of health disparities through research, education, and training,  and through advocacy of policies relevant to underserved populations, particularly in the Black Belt region of Alabama. The UAB CCC has similarly expanded its capacity to conduct cancer health disparities research. In the past 5 years, UAB has recruited 6 new faculty members involved in such research.  Each of the institutions has had increases in cancer research funding, indicating scientific productivity. At MSM, S8M was secured in 2000 to support cancer research. By 2005, cancer research funding increased to $18M, and, by 2010, to $26M. Similarly, cancer research funding increased at TU, exceeding $6M in 2010. At  the UAB CCC, there was an increase in annual funding from $12M in 2005 to $22M by 2010 in its Cancer Control and Population Sciences Program. This increase was mostly related to research on cancer disparities.  While the evaluation of each of the cores and programs is detailed in the respective sections, it is appropriate to highlight some of the achievements. The Developmental Research Proaram continues to be strengthened and to produce competitive and productive investigators. Since its inception, 10 pilot projects and 1 full project have been awarded, and all but one pilot have been or are being successfully conducted. As of December 2010, 17 peer-reviewed publications directly related to the goals of U54 have been generated, a remarkable increase from 1 publication in 2008. Additionally, investigators of this Partnership have published 75 peer-reviewed manuscripts that are directly related to cancer disparities (see Appendix A-C). Over the past 5 years, the Cancer Training Program has trained 81 scholars (28 junior faculty and 53 graduate students) to perform cancer-related research. While 61% of the scholars have extramural funding, 21% have secured additional extramural funding since completing the program.), and 43% of them have published manuscripts.  The Cancer Education Program, which is essential for ensuring a pipeline of well-trained students who elect to pursue research in cancer health disparities and related professions, has developed a cancer-related course (Foundations of Cancer Biology) that has been incorporated and sustained as part of the TU curriculum.  Recently, Cancer Education Co-Leaders and Bioethics Shared Resource members of the Partnership have developed and offered a Health Disparities, Bioethics, and Policy course at TU.  The Cancer Outreach Programs, based on the community health advisor model, have achieved their medium-term outcomes. Through a relationship with the Department of Public Health, the MSM program disseminated an intervention for colon cancer screening in the greater Atlanta area. UAB's Cancer Outreach Program increased participation of African Americans in cancer therapeutic trials, with 180 referrals to the  program and 124 cancer survivors enrolling in their IMPACT program. At TU, outreach efforts led to a program addressing healthy lifestyles among rural residents, with participants increasing physical activity and making improved dietary choices. Bioethics activities continue to be highly rated within the Partnership and by other collaborators. As essential resources, Biostatistics and Bioethics are integrated throughout the Partnership.  In summary, consistent with the outcomes outlined in our Evaluation Framework developed for the previous application, our tripartite Partnership has achieved short and medium-term outcomes and is now realizing long-term outcomes, including integrated, organizational changes at each of the institutions. These will lead to high-quality research on cancer health disparities, produce well-trained investigators, and reduce cancer disparities.

"Center of Excellence for Cancer Research, Training and Community Service     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Florida A&M University (FAMU) College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (COPPS) proposes the establishment of an Exploratory Center of Excellence (COE) in the area of Cancer Research, Training and Community Service (CRTCS). African-Americans experience the highest mortality rates associated with most cancer (breast, lung, prostate, etc.) deaths despite decreases in morbidity rates for all other racial and ethnic groups since early 1990. Health disparities are closely related to underlying socioeconomic inequalities and have been linked to racial differences among cancer mortality which presents major challenges across the entire spectrum of cancer prevention, early detection, and access to high quality care for disadvantage and underrepresented groups. The overall goal and objective of the COE CRTCS will consist of researchers focusing on developing innovative cancer research (breast and lung) abnormalities utilizing an interdisciplinary and synergistic approach toward addressing some of the most significant health consequences in minority and socioeconomic disadvantaged populations. This will address novel and innovative approaches to treating and preventing breast and lung cancer. The administrative; biomedical and behavioral research; research training/educational and community engagement/outreach cores will enable the COE CRTCS to accomplish the proposed initiatives. The specific aims of the COE CRTCS are to: 1) Develop detailed innovative research plans that will address specific cancer (breast and lung) health issues that disproportionately impact African-American; 2) Develop a research team conducting cancer research; 3) Train minority PhD graduate students in health disparities research affecting disadvantage and minority populations; 4) Increase the number of minority scientists engaged in biomedical and behavioral research; 5) Establish and enhance community outreach and information dissemination activities that will increase prevention efforts and foster early detection towards reducing breast cancer in African-American women (Leon and Gadsden County, Florida); 6) Establish and expand partnerships with community engagement/outreach organizations toward addressing and conducting minority health and other health disparities issues; and 7) Position FAMU to become more competitive in securing mainstream funding in biomedical and behavioral research support and addressing minority health disparities. The support of this application will promote minority health and aid i the elimination of health disparities as it relates to breast (among African-American females) and lung cancer (among minorities).

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) The overall goal of this collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU), a minority-serving institution, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), a comprehensive cancer center, is to expand the current regional cancer program at NMSU and to increase knowledge and attention to cancer related health disparities at FHCRC and NMSU. Three specific aims will help us achieve our overall goal: 1.To conduct a diverse portfolio of cancer research projects. We will use the same structured development and rigorous review process to select new projects during the five-year award. 2. To maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective training programs for current and future underserved scientists. A new core will integrate all training components. 3. To implement cancer-related public health interventions in underserved communities. As part of this aim, we will conduct research and disseminate evidence-based practices. This proposal begins with a section elucidating the overall objectives and partnership integration of the proposal. We discuss our goals and objectives, our planning, and especially our progress in the current U54. This is followed by an Administrative Core (Core B) that describes the leadership of the two institutions and the mechanism for ensuring junior faculty have sufficient mentorship to move to senior positions. Our Planning and Evaluation Core (Core C) outlines the rigorous procedures we have in place for evaluating current and future projects. The Development Core (Core D) includes two pilot projects and two full projects. Our new Integrated Training and Evaluation Core (Core E) seeks to provide numerous opportunities for ongoing training and meticulous evaluation of those training activities. The Outreach Core (Core F) focuses on training medical residents and health care providers, an academic-community partnership, and outreach through Community Health Educators who will collaborate with the County Extension Service to provide evidence-based interventions to community members.

"UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request funding for a five-year renewal of our very successful Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) program (grant 5R25 CA76023) that has been funded by NCI's R25E program since 1999. CaRES provides paid short summer cancer research internships for University of Alabama School of Medicine (UAB) medical students, UAB public health students, and other UAB graduate health professional students, all of whom are American citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. In its 15th year, CaRES has supported over 500 students to date. Typically first-year medical students and graduate students participate, but students who hold a letter of acceptance qualify for CaRES in the summer prior to enrolling in their degree program. CaRES projects have been conducted on the UAB campus under the guidance of UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center faculty members. If we are granted additional funding we will enhance CaRES in four ways. We will broaden student eligibility by recruiting health professional students from three Alabama universities (University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University) in addition to UAB; we will increase the number of opportunities for cancer research in genomics and translational research by basing some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama; we will tighten our student-preceptor research agreements by means of a mentoring contract; and we will increase the depth and breadth of instruction in career development and in the responsible conduct of research through an expanded seminar series and by affording students the opportunity to participate in other seminars, workshops, and courses. With these innovations we believe that CaRES will become nationally recognized as a premier R25E short- term cancer research training program. Further, we believe that our innovations will ignite collaborative cancer research and service activity in Alabama, a state characterized by low income, low education, and a large minority population that is medically under-served and at high risk for cancer and other chronic diseases.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We request funding to continue our ""CaRES"" cancer research training program that pays UAB medical students and public health students to do summer cancer research projects. For the first time we will include students from the University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University in the CaRES program; and we will base some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville.

"2/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to establish a Partnership between Alabama State University (ASU) and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved African American population, has goals of attaining excellence in research focused on cancer health disparities. The two institutions possess unique strengths that supplement each other. At ASU, which is classified as a historically black college and university (HBCU), more than 90% of students and more than 60% of the faculty belong to an underserved minority community in which health disparities are a significant issue in various areas, including cancer. The UAB CCC, in contrast, has developed an extensive infrastructure and critical mass of scientists that are necessary for a sustained research program. Still, ASU has a cultural sensitivity and perspective that may be deficient in the UAB CCC. Thus, the partners will facilitate collaborations in cancer-related research, training (career development), and education to aid this underserved community. UAB CCC faculty/scientists will cooperate with faculty and students at ASU and thereby initiate cancer research programs, creating an conduit for ASU faculty and students to pursue cancer research programs. The proposed effort will engage underserved groups by providing advanced research in prostate and colorectal cancer (both of which are major cancer health disparities for African Americans), by providing training to students and faculty members and by introducing topics related to cancer health disparities into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at ASU. The proposed Partnership has an Administrative Core, a Cancer Research Program with two functioning projects, and a Cancer Training and Education Program. Within the Administrative Core, there are Bioethics Support, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Support, and Evaluation Support. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee, which will consist of two distinguished scientists of each institution; an Executive Committee with members of both institutions; and, for each organization, a Partnership Institutional Committee. The Cancer Training and Education Program will reach talented students and faculty at ASU, linking them to established investigators and to the research infrastructure at the UAB CCC, and facilitate faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student and education in the area of cancer research in order to increase the number of minority investigators involved in cancer research. The goal of the Bioethics support will be to provide exceptional bioethics education, training, guidance, and consultation throughout the Partnership. The goal of the Biostatistics/Bioinformatics support will be to address the statistical/bioinformatics needs of the research projects sponsored by the Partnership. The specific aims for the Partnership are: (1) to enhance, by development of junior faculty members, the research and administrative infrastructure to conduct competitive basic and community-based cancer research at ASU; (2) to develop investigators committed to research in cancer disparities at both partnering institutions; and (3) to establish a pipeline of minority cancer disparity researchers and health professionals between ASU and UAB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed partnership between Alabama State University (ASU), a Historically Black Colleges and University and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC) builds upon current efforts to establish collaborative research infrastructure between the two institutions.

"MMC, VICC & TSU:  Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 2 of 3) Strong ties have developed between cancer researchers at Meharry Medical College (MMC), Tennessee State University (TSU) and Vanderbilt-lngram Cancer Center (VICC) resulting in this formal Cancer Partnership. Our Partnership is dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities in the US. The U54 award is the bedrock of this collaboration and has moved our collaborative research more forcefully toward a relationship that is based on reciprocity and stronger mutual benefit. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are: (1) to increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of MMC and TSU; (2) to create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the VICC in cancer research, research training, career development and cancer outreach; and (3) to improve the effectiveness of VICC research, training, career development, cancer education and cancer outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations in the region served by VICC. Funds provided by this U54 will solidify our collaboration. During this phase of our Cancer Partnership, we continue to concentrate on amassing sufficient infrastructure for cancer research that will strengthen reciprocity between MMC, TSU and VICC. In addition to funding two full projects and two pilot studies involving collaborators from all three institutions, funds will be used to recruit investigators to TSU and VICC and to strengthen infrastructure in basic, epidemiologic and clinical cancer research through the support of core facilities providing expertise in biostatistics, clinical trial accruals, histopathology and cancer outreach. All activities involve coordinated, well-planned interactions between MMC, TSU and VICC and will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee composed of members from each institution and a Program Steering Committee composed of external, nationally-recognized cancer investigators and representation from the National Cancer Institute. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The institution's complementary strengths will help the Cancer Partnership establish effective cancer research and increase training opportunities at two minority-serving institutions enhance community- and population-based science research targeting minority cancer-related disparities and increase training of minority scientists at an NCI-funded Comprehensive Cancer Center. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment and focus for the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to identify the determinants of the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by African Americans, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and compounded by lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority training programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will help address these health disparities at the partnering institutions.","MMC, VICC & TSU:  Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities ( 2 of 3)",8915067,U54CA163072,"['Age ', ' Award ', ' Biology ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' Breast ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Chemistry ', ' clinical investigation ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Environment ', ' epidemiological ', ' epidemiologic ', ' Epidemiology ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' Mission ', ' Mortality ', ' Mortality Vital Statistics ', ' Nursing Profession ', ' Nursing Field ', ' Nursing ', ' Discipline of Nursing ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Primary Prevention ', ' Prostatic Gland ', ' Prostate Gland ', ' Prostate ', ' recruit ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Science ', ' Tennessee ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Relative ', ' Relative (related person) ', ' black American ', ' Black or African American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Community Health Care ', ' Community Healthcare ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Phase ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' lung cancer ', ' Pulmonary malignant Neoplasm ', ' Pulmonary Cancer ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Lung ', ' Malignant neoplasm of lung ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Consensus ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Colon or Rectum ', ' Colorectal ', ' Services ', ' success ', ' Histopathology ', ' Participant ', ' Preventive strategy ', ' Prevention strategy ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' personnel ', ' Manpower ', ' Human Resources ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' career development ', ' nanotech ', ' nano technology ', ' nano tech ', ' nano scale Science ', ' Nanoscale Science ', ' Nanotechnology ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' health disparities ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Targeted Research ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Infrastructure ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underserved minority ', ' under-represented minority ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' Underrepresented Groups ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' population based ', ' undergraduate student ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY,U54,2015,664819,0.1388553331135533
"UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"Xavier RCMI Center for Cancer Research      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since its inception in 2009, Xavier University's RCIVII Center for Cancer Research has been a driving force toward achieving the University's goal of becoming a national leader in cancer and health disparities research. We propose five alms in order to move closer to attaining this goal. (1) Strengthen internal and external collaborations and partnerships, particularly those that promote health disparities and translational research: building on existing collaborations with LSU, LSU Health Sciences Center, Tulane University and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center through active partnerships in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium and the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network, we will leverage research and mentoring resources in place and establish new ones via partnerships formed within Xavier and between Xavier and RTRN institutions. (2) Reorganize and enhance critical core facilities: we will down size one existing core, create a new core in drug discovery and delivery and add -a bioinformatics facility to our existing Cell and Molecular Biology Core. (3) Increase Xavier's pool of competitive and productive cancer and health disparities researchers who participate in the translational research ""pipeline:"" we will retain previously hired, now competitive, RCMI faculty, hire additional promising junior faculty in critical ""gap"" areas that will improve our capabilities in health disparities and translational research, and provide these faculty with the resources necessary to become/remain competitive. (4)Establish a new pilot project program for cancer/health disparities research: we will use a peer-reviewed mechanism to select projects that will increase Xavier NIH R01 and other R-series grants and support pilot translational research projects for preliminary data collection. (5) Provide targeted administrative services in support of RCMI investigators: we will assure that faculty needs are met with minimal burden, research programs and core services are integrated and encourage teamwork, and that faculty development programs promote professional growth and engagement in health disparities and translational research. Successfully completing these aims will be significant because it will increase the pool of researchers who can more quickly translate bench discoveries into public benefit, particularly in minority communities. The research projects supported by the present RCMI proposal will be innovative as we propose to utilize a programmatic structure involving partnerships with major research universities, an NIH-supported Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities and an NIH-funded center for translational sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer remains a major public health problem, especially among African Americans.

"Center of Excellence for Cancer Research, Training and Community Service     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Florida A&M University (FAMU) College of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences (COPPS) proposes the establishment of an Exploratory Center of Excellence (COE) in the area of Cancer Research, Training and Community Service (CRTCS). African-Americans experience the highest mortality rates associated with most cancer (breast, lung, prostate, etc.) deaths despite decreases in morbidity rates for all other racial and ethnic groups since early 1990. Health disparities are closely related to underlying socioeconomic inequalities and have been linked to racial differences among cancer mortality which presents major challenges across the entire spectrum of cancer prevention, early detection, and access to high quality care for disadvantage and underrepresented groups. The overall goal and objective of the COE CRTCS will consist of researchers focusing on developing innovative cancer research (breast and lung) abnormalities utilizing an interdisciplinary and synergistic approach toward addressing some of the most significant health consequences in minority and socioeconomic disadvantaged populations. This will address novel and innovative approaches to treating and preventing breast and lung cancer. The administrative; biomedical and behavioral research; research training/educational and community engagement/outreach cores will enable the COE CRTCS to accomplish the proposed initiatives.

"MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3)",9210827,U54CA163072,"['Age ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Articulation ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Medical Students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' underserved minority ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2016,1314524,0.08545320989531527
"UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach.

"Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) requests renewal of support for the project “Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer.” The funds will provide Minority Scholar in Cancer Research Awards to support the attendance of young scientists from NIH- recognized minority populations at high-caliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multi-level program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of underrepresentation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. The AACR is grateful for the National Cancer Institute (NCI)’s 30 years of support of minorities in cancer research, and anticipates continuing the success of this program in 2016-2021. The Minority Scholar in Cancer Research Awards expose early-career minority scientists to the best and most current cancer science and medicine through their participation in AACR Annual Meetings and Special Conferences. In addition to exposure to cutting-edge cancer research, scholar awardees also gain access to mentoring and networking contacts with experienced investigators, career-building showcases for their achievements, and professional advancement advice. These awards are given annually to minority undergraduate students, graduate students, medical students, residents, and clinical and postdoctoral fellows to support their participation at the meeting or conference. These awards have been generously supported through this R13 funding mechanism from 1985-2015, and through bridge funding during the most recent program year, 2015-2016, while a professional evaluation of the program was finalized. With this application, AACR is proud to share the results of this evaluation, conducted by Thomson Reuters (Scientific) LLC. Career gains for Minority Scholar awardees were demonstrated to be greater than those of unsuccessful applicants on at least two measures: publications and career promotions. Analysis confirmed the significant and durable benefits for scholar awardees that have also been attested to by scholar awardee narratives throughout the years. 1 This project is a critical initiative by the AACR to address the issue of minority underrepresentation in cancer research, operating to encourage more minority scientists to contribute to and persevere in the field of cancer research. Minority cancer researchers have many unique roles to play in cancer research, including mentoring future minority students, and adding diverse voices to this field of study to produce innovation. But perhaps the most important is to improve outcomes for minority patients. Minority research scientists could be more successful in balancing the diversity of clinical trial subjects and more successful in inspiring the trust of subjects. Dedicated minority researchers also have the potential to succeed with behavioral interventions that require outreach to minority communities, due to sensitivity to cultures and even the locations of targeted populations. 1",Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer,9261262,R13CA040577,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Authorship ', ' Award ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Medical Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Voice ', ' Work ', ' Measures ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' Institution ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' undergraduate student ', ' improved outcome ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority scientist ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' minority student ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2016,69443,0.13871979820142283
"3/3 Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT: This type-2 application is to strengthen and build upon the established U54 Partnership between Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African American population, has the overall goal of attaining excellence in research focused on elimination of cancer health disparities and on reducing the cancer burden among underserved populations in the region. The partnering institutions possess unique strengths that complement each other in achieving the proposed goal through integrated research, education, and outreach. The primary objectives are to enhance productive cancer research programs, to develop a pipeline of racial/ethnic minority investigators in cancer research at MSM and TU, and to increase the level of involvement of investigators conducting research on cancer disparities at the UAB CCC. The Partnership has four Cores (Administrative, Outreach, Research Education, and Planning & Evaluation); two Full Research Projects; a Pilot Research Project; and two Shared Resources (Bioethics and Biostatistics/Bioinformatics). With these assets and activities, the Partnership will: 1) through the full projects, identify molecular mechanisms and new therapeutic targets for metastatic prostate cancer, which is present at a higher rate in African American men, and, through the pilot project, adapt the current, successful patient navigation program for racial/ethnic minority recruitment at the UAB CCC for implementation at the MSM and Grady Hospital; 2) through the Outreach Core, apply an innovative cancer survivor care plan at MSM, TU, and the UAB CCC by linking community- and health system-based patient navigators and advisors to improve satisfaction with care, and implement culturally appropriate community health education for cancer survivors and caregivers; 3) through the Research Education Core, employ an integrated cancer research education program that involves capacity building and linkages to undergraduate and graduate students and junior faculty, allowing them to pursue careers in cancer research; and 4) provide funding for additional Pilot Research projects. The Planning & Evaluation Core will continually assess/evaluate the outcomes of the cores, research projects, and shared resources. The Bioethics Shared Resource will promote and ensure adherence to bioethical principles and address ethical considerations in relationships between the institutions and between the institutions and communities. The Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Shared Resource will deliver statistical and bioinformatics support for all activities. Together, we will contribute to elimination of cancer health disparities.  8. PROJECT NARRATIVE This type 2 U54 application is from the existing, successful Partnership between Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM), Tuskegee University (TU), and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UABCCC), which is committed to elimination of cancer health disparities in racial/ethnic minority and underserved populations in the `Deep South,' particularly among African Americans. By leveraging the distinct yet complementary strengths and resources of this Partnership, rigorous and collaborative transdisciplinary research that encompasses basic biologic, preclinical, clinical, educational, behavioral, social, and community-based programs is proposed to understand the causes for cancer health disparities and to test evidence-based solutions.  ",3/3 Morehouse Sch of Medicine/Tuskegee Univ/University of Alabama Ca Ctr Partnership,9353540,U54CA118948,"['Affect ', ' Alabama ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Bioethics ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biological Sciences ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Communities ', ' Community HealthTutoring ', ' Community Health Taining ', ' Community Education ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' dietary ', ' Diet ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Heart ', ' History ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' Hospitals ', "" men's "", ' men ', ' Patients ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Publishing ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' Testing ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Caregivers ', ' Care Givers ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' symposium ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Physical activity ', ' Rural ', ' satisfaction ', ' Policies ', ' Community Health Systems ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' colorectal cancer early detection ', ' colo-rectal cancer screening ', ' CRC screening ', ' colorectal cancer screening ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' interest ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' cancer risk ', ' success ', ' Manuscripts ', ' member ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' social ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' education planning ', ' cancer care ', ' Prostate Carcinoma Metastatic ', ' Metastatic Prostate Cancer ', ' Risk Reduction ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Adherence ', ' Bioinformatics Shared Resource ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' P20 Grant ', ' Cancer Center Planning Grant ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' survive cancer ', ' Cancer Survivor ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Extramural ', ' EXTMR ', ' Extramural Activities ', ' Outreach Research ', ' Molecular ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Behavioral ', ' preclinical ', ' pre-clinical ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' underserved people ', ' under served population ', ' Underserved Population ', ' next generation ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' Deep South ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' biological research ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' new therapeutic target ', ' novel therapy target ', ' novel therapeutic target ', ' novel pharmacotherapy target ', ' novel drug target ', ' new therapy target ', ' new pharmacotherapy target ', ' new drug target ', ' evidence base ', ' Secure ', ' Morehouse School of Medicine ', ' Morehouse School of Med ', ' Morehouse Sch of Medicine ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Therapeutic Trials ', ' healthy lifestyle ', ' faculty research ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' education research ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority student ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,U54,2016,162279,0.08502797603529642
"UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request funding for a five-year renewal of our very successful Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) program (grant 5R25 CA76023) that has been funded by NCI's R25E program since 1999. CaRES provides paid short summer cancer research internships for University of Alabama School of Medicine (UAB) medical students, UAB public health students, and other UAB graduate health professional students, all of whom are American citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. In its 15th year, CaRES has supported over 500 students to date. Typically first-year medical students and graduate students participate, but students who hold a letter of acceptance qualify for CaRES in the summer prior to enrolling in their degree program. CaRES projects have been conducted on the UAB campus under the guidance of UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center faculty members. If we are granted additional funding we will enhance CaRES in four ways. We will broaden student eligibility by recruiting health professional students from three Alabama universities (University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University) in addition to UAB; we will increase the number of opportunities for cancer research in genomics and translational research by basing some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama; we will tighten our student-preceptor research agreements by means of a mentoring contract; and we will increase the depth and breadth of instruction in career development and in the responsible conduct of research through an expanded seminar series and by affording students the opportunity to participate in other seminars, workshops, and courses. With these innovations we believe that CaRES will become nationally recognized as a premier R25E short- term cancer research training program. Further, we believe that our innovations will ignite collaborative cancer research and service activity in Alabama, a state characterized by low income, low education, and a large minority population that is medically under-served and at high risk for cancer and other chronic diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We request funding to continue our ""CaRES"" cancer research training program that pays UAB medical students and public health students to do summer cancer research projects. For the first time we will include students from the University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University in the CaRES program; and we will base some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville. We anticipate that by virtue of their CaRES research experiences some of the participating students will choose cancer research careers, accomplishing the main goal of the CaRES program.",UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students,9130759,R25CA076023,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Alabama ', ' Biotech ', ' Biotechnology ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Professional Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Institutes ', ' intern ', ' Internships ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Pharmacy Students ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Letters ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' Contracts ', ' programs ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' Benchmarking ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' college student ', ' university student ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' graduate student ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Public Health Students ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' High-Risk Cancer ', ' Qualifying ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research enterprise ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research Enterprise ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' personalized genomic medicine ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Degree program ', ' Student recruitment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R25,2016,351505,0.1093745183014248
"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research The Minority Faculty Scholar in Cancer Research Awards increase the scientific knowledge base of faculty at Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and encourage them and their students to pursue careers in cancer research. Now in their 20th year, these awards are given throughout the year to faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and other Minority Institutions as defined by the US Department of Education. Beginning in 2016-2017, minority junior faculty at majority institutions will also be eligible to apply for this support for participation in an American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting or Special Conference. With this application, AACR is proud to share the results of this evaluation, conducted by Thomson Reuters (Scientific) LLC. This evaluation proved the lasting value of the program to faculty scholar awardees, their research programs, and by extension, to the next generation of cancer researchers that they train in the laboratory and in the classroom. With the generous support of the NCI and a few improvements to this long-standing program, AACR can assure that it remains innovative and essential to the future of cancer research. Racial/ethnic minorities are currently underrepresented as faculty in the field of oncology. Gains towards increasing the diversity of the field have so far been modest.

"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) The overall goal of this collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU), a minority-serving institution, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), a comprehensive cancer center, is to expand the current regional cancer program at NMSU and to increase knowledge and attention to cancer related health disparities at FHCRC and NMSU. Three specific aims will help us achieve our overall goal: 1.To conduct a diverse portfolio of cancer research projects. We will use the same structured development and rigorous review process to select new projects during the five-year award. 2. To maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective training programs for current and future underserved scientists. A new core will integrate all training components. 3. To implement cancer-related public health interventions in underserved communities. As part of this aim, we will conduct research and disseminate evidence-based practices. This proposal begins with a section elucidating the overall objectives and partnership integration of the proposal. We discuss our goals and objectives, our planning, and especially our progress in the current U54. This is followed by an Administrative Core (Core B) that describes the leadership of the two institutions and the mechanism for ensuring junior faculty have sufficient mentorship to move to senior positions. Our Planning and Evaluation Core (Core C) outlines the rigorous procedures we have in place for evaluating current and future projects. The Development Core (Core D) includes two pilot projects and two full projects. Our new Integrated Training and Evaluation Core (Core E) seeks to provide numerous opportunities for ongoing training and meticulous evaluation of those training activities. The Outreach Core (Core F) focuses on training medical residents and health care providers, an academic-community partnership, and outreach through Community Health Educators who will collaborate with the County Extension Service to provide evidence-based interventions to community members. A logic model indicates how the pieces come together to have significant impact on both cancer research and cancer disparities. This collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU) and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research  Center (FHCRC) seeks to build and enhance cancer research at NMSU, increase attention to health  disparities at the FHCRC, train underrepresented students as well as junior faculty to fill cancer research  positions throughout the nation, and provide outreach on cancer awareness and education to New Mexico.",Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2),9128557,U54CA132383,"['Attention ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' treatment provider ', ' medical personnel ', ' healthcare personnel ', ' health provider ', ' health care worker ', ' health care personnel ', ' Healthcare worker ', ' Healthcare Providers ', ' Health Care Providers ', ' Health Personnel ', ' Leadership ', ' Logic ', ' Mentorship ', ' New Mexico ', ' pilot study ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' Research ', ' training module ', ' Training Activity ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' County ', ' Procedures ', ' Medical ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Collaborations ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Services ', ' Regional Cancer ', ' Structure ', ' member ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Modeling ', ' Health Educators ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Evidence based practice ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center ', ' Process ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' Evidence based intervention ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' public health intervention ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' under-represented student ', ' community partnership ', ' ']",NCI,NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY LAS CRUCES,U54,2016,840646,0.1461737609487739
"(2/2) Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to improve the translational and community-based HPV-associated cancer research, education, and training at Howard University through collaborative projects and an effective long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. Human papillomavirus (HPV) accounts for 5.2% of cancer cases worldwide. Several strains of HPV cause a variety of devastating reproductive and oropharyngeal cancers. In the United States, about 26,700 cases of HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually. African American women suffer from a significantly higher incidence rate of HPV-associated cervical, vaginal, and anal cancers compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Additionally, HPV-16 has been identified in approximately 20-30% of head and neck cancers and roughly 56% of oropharynx and oral cavity cancers. Howard University Medical Institutions have a historically Black student body, and its medical and dental facilities participate in direct service to minority populations. However, Howard University faces significant challenges in cancer research and health disparities efforts. Johns Hopkins is committed to providing mentorship and educational resources in cancer research to improve Howard's capacities. Howard is a leading minority-serving institution, while Johns Hopkins is a well-established NCI-designated Cancer Center. An educational effort that brings together Howard doctors and dentists who focus on minorities and Johns Hopkins researchers who study HPV-related cancers will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions. Through a set of collaborative pilot projects that include HPV vaccine development in mice models, epidemiology research in a Washington D.C. community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network between the two universities, this collaboration will significantly enhance career development, education, and competitiveness in seeking funding opportunities for Howard students and educators. Specific aims will be: 1) to support collaborative cancer research projects between the Howard University Medical Institutions and the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins; 2) to provide collaborative training and mentoring programs for promoting Howard medical and dental students and faculty in cancer research, 3) to establish education programs that advance the knowledge of cancer research as it applies to etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV-associated cancer in the context of minority-serving institutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research.  This effective, long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center features collaborative pilot projects such as HPV vaccine development, epidemiology research in a community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network to improve the translational and community-based cancer health research capabilities of Howard University. Data from the projects will contribute to publications and competitive grant applications for Howard University scientists, and the overall collaboration will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions in the Washington D.C./Baltimore metropolitan area.            ",(2/2) Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research,9137505,P20CA192988,"['Accounting ', ' epidemiologic investigation ', ' Epidemiology Research ', ' Epidemiological Studies ', ' Epidemiologic Research ', ' Epidemiologic Studies ', ' Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Baltimore ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' dental health care facility ', ' Dental Facilities ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"2/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to establish a Partnership between Alabama State University (ASU) and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved African American population, has goals of attaining excellence in research focused on cancer health disparities. The two institutions possess unique strengths that supplement each other. At ASU, which is classified as a historically black college and university (HBCU), more than 90% of students and more than 60% of the faculty belong to an underserved minority community in which health disparities are a significant issue in various areas, including cancer. The UAB CCC, in contrast, has developed an extensive infrastructure and critical mass of scientists that are necessary for a sustained research program. Still, ASU has a cultural sensitivity and perspective that may be deficient in the UAB CCC. Thus, the partners will facilitate collaborations in cancer-related research, training (career development), and education to aid this underserved community. UAB CCC faculty/scientists will cooperate with faculty and students at ASU and thereby initiate cancer research programs, creating an conduit for ASU faculty and students to pursue cancer research programs. The proposed effort will engage underserved groups by providing advanced research in prostate and colorectal cancer (both of which are major cancer health disparities for African Americans), by providing training to students and faculty members and by introducing topics related to cancer health disparities into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at ASU. The proposed Partnership has an Administrative Core, a Cancer Research Program with two functioning projects, and a Cancer Training and Education Program. Within the Administrative Core, there are Bioethics Support, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Support, and Evaluation Support. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee, which will consist of two distinguished scientists of each institution; an Executive Committee with members of both institutions; and, for each organization, a Partnership Institutional Committee. The Cancer Training and Education Program will reach talented students and faculty at ASU, linking them to established investigators and to the research infrastructure at the UAB CCC, and facilitate faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student and education in the area of cancer research in order to increase the number of minority investigators involved in cancer research. The goal of the Bioethics support will be to provide exceptional bioethics education, training, guidance, and consultation throughout the Partnership. The goal of the Biostatistics/Bioinformatics support will be to address the statistical/bioinformatics needs of the research projects sponsored by the Partnership. The specific aims for the Partnership are: (1) to enhance, by development of junior faculty members, the research and administrative infrastructure to conduct competitive basic and community-based cancer research at ASU; (2) to develop investigators committed to research in cancer disparities at both partnering institutions; and (3) to establish a pipeline of minority cancer disparity researchers and health professionals between ASU and UAB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed partnership between Alabama State University (ASU), a Historically Black Colleges and University and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC) builds upon current efforts to establish collaborative research infrastructure between the two institutions.

"Xavier RCMI Center for Cancer Research      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since its inception in 2009, Xavier University's RCIVII Center for Cancer Research has been a driving force toward achieving the University's goal of becoming a national leader in cancer and health disparities research. We propose five alms in order to move closer to attaining this goal. (1) Strengthen internal and external collaborations and partnerships, particularly those that promote health disparities and translational research: building on existing collaborations with LSU, LSU Health Sciences Center, Tulane University and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center through active partnerships in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium and the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network, we will leverage research and mentoring resources in place and establish new ones via partnerships formed within Xavier and between Xavier and RTRN institutions. (2) Reorganize and enhance critical core facilities: we will down size one existing core, create a new core in drug discovery and delivery and add -a bioinformatics facility to our existing Cell and Molecular Biology Core. (3) Increase Xavier's pool of competitive and productive cancer and health disparities researchers who participate in the translational research ""pipeline:"" we will retain previously hired, now competitive, RCMI faculty, hire additional promising junior faculty in critical ""gap"" areas that will improve our capabilities in health disparities and translational research, and provide these faculty with the resources necessary to become/remain competitive. (4)Establish a new pilot project program for cancer/health disparities research: we will use a peer-reviewed mechanism to select projects that will increase Xavier NIH R01 and other R-series grants and support pilot translational research projects for preliminary data collection. (5) Provide targeted administrative services in support of RCMI investigators: we will assure that faculty needs are met with minimal burden, research programs and core services are integrated and encourage teamwork, and that faculty development programs promote professional growth and engagement in health disparities and translational research. Successfully completing these aims will be significant because it will increase the pool of researchers who can more quickly translate bench discoveries into public benefit, particularly in minority communities. The research projects supported by the present RCMI proposal will be innovative as we propose to utilize a programmatic structure involving partnerships with major research universities, an NIH-supported Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities and an NIH-funded center for translational sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer remains a major public health problem, especially among African Americans. Across the U.S., and particularly in Louisiana, the number of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths is significantly higher in African Americans than Caucasians.

"1/2 Howard/Hopkins Intercenter Collaboration in HPV-Associated Cancer Studies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to improve the translational and community-based HPV-associated cancer research, education, and training at Howard University through collaborative projects and an effective long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. Human papillomavirus (HPV) accounts for 5.2% of cancer cases worldwide. Several strains of HPV cause a variety of devastating reproductive and oropharyngeal cancers. In the United States, about 26,700 cases of HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually. African American women suffer from a significantly higher incidence rate of HPV-associated cervical, vaginal, and anal cancers compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Additionally, HPV-16 has been identified in approximately 20-30% of head and neck cancers and roughly 56% of oropharynx and oral cavity cancers. Howard University Medical Institutions have a historically Black student body, and its medical and dental facilities participate in direct service to minority populations. However, Howard University faces significant challenges in cancer research and health disparities efforts. Johns Hopkins is committed to providing mentorship and educational resources in cancer research to improve Howard's capacities. Howard is a leading minority-serving institution, while Johns Hopkins is a well-established NCI-designated Cancer Center. An educational effort that brings together Howard doctors and dentists who focus on minorities and Johns Hopkins researchers who study HPV-related cancers will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions. Through a set of collaborative pilot projects that include HPV vaccine development in mice models, epidemiology research in a Washington D.C. community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network between the two universities, this collaboration will significantly enhance career development, education, and competitiveness in seeking funding opportunities for Howard students and educators. Specific aims will be: 1) to support collaborative cancer research projects between the Howard University Medical Institutions and the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins; 2) to provide collaborative training and mentoring programs for promoting Howard medical and dental students and faculty in cancer research, 3) to establish education programs that advance the knowledge of cancer research as it applies to etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV-associated cancer in the context of minority-serving institutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research. This effective, long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center features collaborative pilot projects such as HPV vaccine development, epidemiology research in a community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network to improve the translational and community-based cancer health research capabilities of Howard University.

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (1 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US.

"UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"(1 of 2) Florida Minority Cancer Research & Training Center: Feasibility Studies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The underrepresentation of minorities in basic, clinical, and behavioral research has been viewed as a significant barrier to addressing cancer disparities and the inclusion of minority populations in clinical trials. Thus, there is a need to develop a cadre of racially and ethnically diverse, well-trained scientists. In this application, w will address the following barriers that underrepresented minorities (URMs) face with a comprehensive, rigorous, and innovative approach that will create opportunities and promote careers in cancer research for these researchers and students: (1) the lack of committed role models, (2) inadequate mentoring, (3) insufficient preparation, (4) low expectations, and (5) unfamiliarity with the culture and idioms of science. Our application focuses on developing a Florida Minority Cancer Research & Training (MiCaRT) Center that will expand our cancer research and training opportunities for URM faculty and students at UF and FAMU and ultimately grow the number of URM scientists and clinical investigators in biomedical research. The University of Florida (UF)- Florida A&M University (FAMU) MiCaRT Center will build on our existing cancer research and training opportunities to grow the number of URM scientists and clinical investigators in higher education and academic leadership. The combination of research training and career development plans for program participants will also create a hub of cancer disparity research activities at both UF and FAMU. Program success will be measured by: (1) admission of students to graduate or medical school for oncology-related training; (2) peer-reviewed presentations; (3) peer-reviewed publications; and (4) extramural NIH/NCI grant submissions.          PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The primary objective of this University of Florida (UF)-Florida A&M University (FAMU) P20 application is to develop a Florida Minority Cancer Research & Training (MiCaRT) Center that will expand our oncology research and training opportunities for underrepresented minority researchers and students and ultimately grow the number of underrepresented scientists and clinical investigators in higher education and academic leadership.             ",(1 of 2) Florida Minority Cancer Research & Training Center: Feasibility

"UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request funding for a five-year renewal of our very successful Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) program (grant 5R25 CA76023) that has been funded by NCI's R25E program since 1999. CaRES provides paid short summer cancer research internships for University of Alabama School of Medicine (UAB) medical students, UAB public health students, and other UAB graduate health professional students, all of whom are American citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. In its 15th year, CaRES has supported over 500 students to date. Typically first-year medical students and graduate students participate, but students who hold a letter of acceptance qualify for CaRES in the summer prior to enrolling in their degree program. CaRES projects have been conducted on the UAB campus under the guidance of UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center faculty members. If we are granted additional funding we will enhance CaRES in four ways. We will broaden student eligibility by recruiting health professional students from three Alabama universities (University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University) in addition to UAB; we will increase the number of opportunities for cancer research in genomics and translational research by basing some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama; we will tighten our student-preceptor research agreements by means of a mentoring contract; and we will increase the depth and breadth of instruction in career development and in the responsible conduct of research through an expanded seminar series and by affording students the opportunity to participate in other seminars, workshops, and courses. With these innovations we believe that CaRES will become nationally recognized as a premier R25E short- term cancer research training program. Further, we believe that our innovations will ignite collaborative cancer research and service activity in Alabama, a state characterized by low income, low education, and a large minority population that is medically under-served and at high risk for cancer and other chronic diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We request funding to continue our ""CaRES"" cancer research training program that pays UAB medical students and public health students to do summer cancer research projects. For the first time we will include students from the University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University in the CaRES program; and we will base some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville. We anticipate that by virtue of their CaRES research experiences some of the participating students will choose cancer research careers, accomplishing the main goal of the CaRES program.",UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students,9339589,R25CA076023,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Alabama ', ' Biotech ', ' Biotechnology ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Professional Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Institutes ', ' Internships ', ' intern ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Recruitment Activity ', ' recruit ', ' active recruitment ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Pharmacy Students ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Letters ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' programs ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Public Health Students ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' High-Risk Cancer ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Degree program ', ' Student recruitment ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R25,2017,342037,0.1093745183014248
"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"(2/2) Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to improve the translational and community-based HPV-associated cancer research, education, and training at Howard University through collaborative projects and an effective long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. Human papillomavirus (HPV) accounts for 5.2% of cancer cases worldwide. Several strains of HPV cause a variety of devastating reproductive and oropharyngeal cancers. In the United States, about 26,700 cases of HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually. African American women suffer from a significantly higher incidence rate of HPV-associated cervical, vaginal, and anal cancers compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Additionally, HPV-16 has been identified in approximately 20-30% of head and neck cancers and roughly 56% of oropharynx and oral cavity cancers. Howard University Medical Institutions have a historically Black student body, and its medical and dental facilities participate in direct service to minority populations. However, Howard University faces significant challenges in cancer research and health disparities efforts. Johns Hopkins is committed to providing mentorship and educational resources in cancer research to improve Howard's capacities. Howard is a leading minority-serving institution, while Johns Hopkins is a well-established NCI-designated Cancer Center. An educational effort that brings together Howard doctors and dentists who focus on minorities and Johns Hopkins researchers who study HPV-related cancers will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions. Through a set of collaborative pilot projects that include HPV vaccine development in mice models, epidemiology research in a Washington D.C. community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network between the two universities, this collaboration will significantly enhance career development, education, and competitiveness in seeking funding opportunities for Howard students and educators. Specific aims will be: 1) to support collaborative cancer research projects between the Howard University Medical Institutions and the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins; 2) to provide collaborative training and mentoring programs for promoting Howard medical and dental students and faculty in cancer research, 3) to establish education programs that advance the knowledge of cancer research as it applies to etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV-associated cancer in the context of minority-serving institutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research.  This effective, long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center features collaborative pilot projects such as HPV vaccine development, epidemiology research in a community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network to improve the translational and community-based cancer health research capabilities of Howard University. Data from the projects will contribute to publications and competitive grant applications for Howard University scientists, and the overall collaboration will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions in the Washington D.C./Baltimore metropolitan area.            ",(2/2) Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research,9330697,P20CA192988,"['Attitude ', ' Awareness ', ' Baltimore ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Uterine Cervix Cancer ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Tumor ', ' Malignant Uterine Cervix Neoplasm ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix Uteri ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Neoplasm of the Cervix ', ' Malignant Cervical Tumor ', ' Malignant Cervical Neoplasm ', ' Cervix Cancer ', ' Cervical Cancer ', ' Malignant neoplasm of cervix uteri ', ' Communities ', ' dental health care facility ', ' Dental Facilities ', ' Dentistry ', ' Dentists ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DC Washington ', ' D.C.

"1/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to establish a Partnership between Alabama State University (ASU) and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved African American population, has goals of attaining excellence in research focused on cancer health disparities. The two institutions possess unique strengths that supplement each other. At ASU, which is classified as a historically black college and university (HBCU), more than 90% of students and more than 60% of the faculty belong to an underserved minority community in which health disparities are a significant issue in various areas, including cancer. The UAB CCC, in contrast, has developed an extensive infrastructure and critical mass of scientists that are necessary for a sustained research program. Still, ASU has a cultural sensitivity and perspective that may be deficient in the UAB CCC. Thus, the partners will facilitate collaborations in cancer-related research, training (career development), and education to aid this underserved community. UAB CCC faculty/scientists will cooperate with faculty and students at ASU and thereby initiate cancer research programs, creating an conduit for ASU faculty and students to pursue cancer research programs. The proposed effort will engage underserved groups by providing advanced research in prostate and colorectal cancer (both of which are major cancer health disparities for African Americans), by providing training to students and faculty members and by introducing topics related to cancer health disparities into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at ASU. The proposed Partnership has an Administrative Core, a Cancer Research Program with two functioning projects, and a Cancer Training and Education Program. Within the Administrative Core, there are Bioethics Support, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Support, and Evaluation Support. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee, which will consist of two distinguished scientists of each institution; an Executive Committee with members of both institutions; and, for each organization, a Partnership Institutional Committee. The Cancer Training and Education Program will reach talented students and faculty at ASU, linking them to established investigators and to the research infrastructure at the UAB CCC, and facilitate faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student and education in the area of cancer research in order to increase the number of minority investigators involved in cancer research. The goal of the Bioethics support will be to provide exceptional bioethics education, training, guidance, and consultation throughout the Partnership. The goal of the Biostatistics/Bioinformatics support will be to address the statistical/bioinformatics needs of the research projects sponsored by the Partnership. The specific aims for the Partnership are: (1) to enhance, by development of junior faculty members, the research and administrative infrastructure to conduct competitive basic and community-based cancer research at ASU; (2) to develop investigators committed to research in cancer disparities at both partnering institutions; and (3) to establish a pipeline of minority cancer disparity researchers and health professionals between ASU and UAB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed partnership between Alabama State University (ASU), a Historically Black Colleges and University and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC) builds upon current efforts to establish collaborative research infrastructure between the two institutions. Each organization possesses a unique set of strengths that effectively cover inherent weaknesses of the other. Of note, the Partnership is geographically located within the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African American population. Since this Partnership seeks to eliminate the gaps in cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality between Whites and Blacks, the demographic characteristics of the available study population are relevant.            ",1/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership,9341909,P20CA192973,"['Alabama ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Bioethics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Communities ', ' Consultations ', ' Continuum of Care ', ' Continuity of Care ', ' Continuity of Patient Care ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' ethical ', ' Ethics ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Heart ', ' Incidence ', ' Life Style ', ' Lifestyle ', ' Mentors ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morals ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' Patients ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Social Behavior ', ' sociobehavioral ', ' sociobehavior ', ' Students ', ' Talents ', ' Testing ', ' Universities ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Organizational Change ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' neoplastic progression ', ' neoplasm progression ', ' cancer progression ', ' tumor progression ', ' Area ', ' Link ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' Nature ', ' Malignant neoplasm of prostate ', ' Prostatic Cancer ', ' Prostate Cancer ', ' Prostate CA ', ' Malignant prostatic tumor ', ' Malignant Tumor of the Prostate ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Immune ', ' Immunes ', ' Complex ', ' Source ', ' System ', ' interest ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' success ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Research Ethics ', ' career development ', ' cancer care ', ' Drops ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Address ', ' Basic Cancer Research ', ' Core Facility ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' University of Alabama at Birmingham Cancer Center ', ' Characteristics ', ' Community Health ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Colo-rectal Cancer ', ' Colorectal Cancer ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' years of life lost to disease ', ' years of life lost to disability ', ' disease burden ', ' burden of disease ', ' burden of illness ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' ethnic minority population ', ' ethnic minority ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' public health relevance ', ' molecular marker ', ' molecular biomarker ', ' undergraduate education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' student training ', ' Cultural Sensitivity ', ' study population ', ' underserved minority ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority scientist ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,P20,2017,191836,0.08753092354709444
"Partnership for the Advancement of Cancer Research: NMSU-FHCRC (1 of 2) The overall goal of this collaboration between New Mexico State University (NMSU), a minority-serving institution, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (FHCRC), a comprehensive cancer center, is to expand the current regional cancer program at NMSU and to increase knowledge and attention to cancer related health disparities at FHCRC and NMSU. Three specific aims will help us achieve our overall goal: 1.To conduct a diverse portfolio of cancer research projects. We will use the same structured development and rigorous review process to select new projects during the five-year award. 2. To maintain, strengthen, and evaluate our effective training programs for current and future underserved scientists. A new core will integrate all training components. 3. To implement cancer-related public health interventions in underserved communities. As part of this aim, we will conduct research and disseminate evidence-based practices. This proposal begins with a section elucidating the overall objectives and partnership integration of the proposal. We discuss our goals and objectives, our planning, and especially our progress in the current U54. This is followed by an Administrative Core (Core B) that describes the leadership of the two institutions and the mechanism for ensuring junior faculty have sufficient mentorship to move to senior positions. Our Planning and Evaluation Core (Core C) outlines the rigorous procedures we have in place for evaluating current and future projects.

"UPR/MDACC Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC.

"MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3)",9356458,U54CA163072,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Medical Students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' infrastructure development ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2017,1340170,0.08545320989531527
"Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) requests renewal of support for the project “Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer.” The funds will provide Minority Scholar in Cancer Research Awards to support the attendance of young scientists from NIH- recognized minority populations at high-caliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multi-level program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of underrepresentation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. The AACR is grateful for the National Cancer Institute (NCI)’s 30 years of support of minorities in cancer research, and anticipates continuing the success of this program in 2016-2021. The Minority Scholar in Cancer Research Awards expose early-career minority scientists to the best and most current cancer science and medicine through their participation in AACR Annual Meetings and Special Conferences. In addition to exposure to cutting-edge cancer research, scholar awardees also gain access to mentoring and networking contacts with experienced investigators, career-building showcases for their achievements, and professional advancement advice. These awards are given annually to minority undergraduate students, graduate students, medical students, residents, and clinical and postdoctoral fellows to support their participation at the meeting or conference. These awards have been generously supported through this R13 funding mechanism from 1985-2015, and through bridge funding during the most recent program year, 2015-2016, while a professional evaluation of the program was finalized. With this application, AACR is proud to share the results of this evaluation, conducted by Thomson Reuters (Scientific) LLC. Career gains for Minority Scholar awardees were demonstrated to be greater than those of unsuccessful applicants on at least two measures: publications and career promotions. Analysis confirmed the significant and durable benefits for scholar awardees that have also been attested to by scholar awardee narratives throughout the years. 1 This project is a critical initiative by the AACR to address the issue of minority underrepresentation in cancer research, operating to encourage more minority scientists to contribute to and persevere in the field of cancer research. Minority cancer researchers have many unique roles to play in cancer research, including mentoring future minority students, and adding diverse voices to this field of study to produce innovation. But perhaps the most important is to improve outcomes for minority patients. Minority research scientists could be more successful in balancing the diversity of clinical trial subjects and more successful in inspiring the trust of subjects. Dedicated minority researchers also have the potential to succeed with behavioral interventions that require outreach to minority communities, due to sensitivity to cultures and even the locations of targeted populations. 1",Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer,9385275,R13CA040577,"['Achievement Attainment ', ' Achievement ', ' Authorship ', ' Award ', ' lifestyle modification ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Life Style Modification ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Medical Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' Institution ', ' Caliber ', ' Diameter ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' improved outcome ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority scientist ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' minority student ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2017,69443,0.13871979820142283
"NCCU-LCCC Partnership in Cancer Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Abstract: The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) will continue their effective and mutually beneficial partnership focusing on African-American health disparities. During the past 13 years NCI funding has firmly established the Partnership building on complementary institutional strengths, conducting molecular and population-based cancer research and training of junior faculty and students. This Comprehensive Partnership to Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) application builds upon the foundation already established through the previous U54 funding to meet the challenge of disparities in cancer incidence and mortality in North Carolina and the US through cancer research, education and community outreach. Our goals are to: (1) strengthen cancer research capacity at NCCU providing NCCU scientists mentorship and collaborative opportunities to compete for NCI grants; (2) enrich the capacity of NCCU and LCCC to further explore mechanisms underlying the disproportionate incidence of cancer mortality and morbidity between African Americans and Caucasian Americans, using both molecular and population-based approaches; (3) increase the number of NCCU scientists focused on cancer research as well as the education of minority undergraduate and graduate students in cancer research; (4) increase the faculty at the UNC LCCC focused on minority disparities research; and (5) create long-term collaborations between basic, public health, and translational scientists from NCCU and UNC LCCC. The strengths of each institution are uniquely positioned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: Two full and one pilot projects in community intervention and population science, one full and one pilot project in basic/translational cancer research in diseases with a higher incidence in African Americans, and 3 cores: Outreach, Research Education, and Histopathology. The partnership combines the expertise and resources of LCCC in population/public health sciences emphasizing disparities in North Carolina, genomics, cancer biology and cancer education and NCCU's demonstrated interest and faculty with minority health disparities research particularly in Durham NC, the state-funded NCCU units that allow faculty release from teaching and the emphasis on reaching minority populations and developing the careers of, faculty and students.

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (1 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (1 of 3)",9356457,U54CA163069,"['Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Medical Students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' infrastructure development ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' ages ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U54,2017,1426662,0.08545320989531527
"Xavier RCMI Center for Cancer Research      DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Since its inception in 2009, Xavier University's RCIVII Center for Cancer Research has been a driving force toward achieving the University's goal of becoming a national leader in cancer and health disparities research. We propose five alms in order to move closer to attaining this goal. (1) Strengthen internal and external collaborations and partnerships, particularly those that promote health disparities and translational research: building on existing collaborations with LSU, LSU Health Sciences Center, Tulane University and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center through active partnerships in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium and the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network, we will leverage research and mentoring resources in place and establish new ones via partnerships formed within Xavier and between Xavier and RTRN institutions. (2) Reorganize and enhance critical core facilities: we will down size one existing core, create a new core in drug discovery and delivery and add -a bioinformatics facility to our existing Cell and Molecular Biology Core. (3) Increase Xavier's pool of competitive and productive cancer and health disparities researchers who participate in the translational research ""pipeline:"" we will retain previously hired, now competitive, RCMI faculty, hire additional promising junior faculty in critical ""gap"" areas that will improve our capabilities in health disparities and translational research, and provide these faculty with the resources necessary to become/remain competitive. (4)Establish a new pilot project program for cancer/health disparities research: we will use a peer-reviewed mechanism to select projects that will increase Xavier NIH R01 and other R-series grants and support pilot translational research projects for preliminary data collection. (5) Provide targeted administrative services in support of RCMI investigators: we will assure that faculty needs are met with minimal burden, research programs and core services are integrated and encourage teamwork, and that faculty development programs promote professional growth and engagement in health disparities and translational research. Successfully completing these aims will be significant because it will increase the pool of researchers who can more quickly translate bench discoveries into public benefit, particularly in minority communities. The research projects supported by the present RCMI proposal will be innovative as we propose to utilize a programmatic structure involving partnerships with major research universities, an NIH-supported Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities and an NIH-funded center for translational sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer remains a major public health problem, especially among African Americans. Across the U.S., and particularly in Louisiana, the number of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths is significantly higher in African Americans than Caucasians.

"MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research The Minority Faculty Scholar in Cancer Research Awards increase the scientific knowledge base of faculty at Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and encourage them and their students to pursue careers in cancer research. Now in their 20th year, these awards are given throughout the year to faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving Institutions, and other Minority Institutions as defined by the US Department of Education. Beginning in 2016-2017, minority junior faculty at majority institutions will also be eligible to apply for this support for participation in an American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting or Special Conference. With this application, AACR is proud to share the results of this evaluation, conducted by Thomson Reuters (Scientific) LLC. This evaluation proved the lasting value of the program to faculty scholar awardees, their research programs, and by extension, to the next generation of cancer researchers that they train in the laboratory and in the classroom. With the generous support of the NCI and a few improvements to this long-standing program, AACR can assure that it remains innovative and essential to the future of cancer research. Racial/ethnic minorities are currently underrepresented as faculty in the field of oncology. Gains towards increasing the diversity of the field have so far been modest.

"2/2 The Alabama State University/UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center Partnership ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is to establish a Partnership between Alabama State University (ASU) and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC). The Partnership, located in the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved African American population, has goals of attaining excellence in research focused on cancer health disparities. The two institutions possess unique strengths that supplement each other. At ASU, which is classified as a historically black college and university (HBCU), more than 90% of students and more than 60% of the faculty belong to an underserved minority community in which health disparities are a significant issue in various areas, including cancer. The UAB CCC, in contrast, has developed an extensive infrastructure and critical mass of scientists that are necessary for a sustained research program. Still, ASU has a cultural sensitivity and perspective that may be deficient in the UAB CCC. Thus, the partners will facilitate collaborations in cancer-related research, training (career development), and education to aid this underserved community. UAB CCC faculty/scientists will cooperate with faculty and students at ASU and thereby initiate cancer research programs, creating an conduit for ASU faculty and students to pursue cancer research programs. The proposed effort will engage underserved groups by providing advanced research in prostate and colorectal cancer (both of which are major cancer health disparities for African Americans), by providing training to students and faculty members and by introducing topics related to cancer health disparities into the undergraduate and graduate curriculum at ASU. The proposed Partnership has an Administrative Core, a Cancer Research Program with two functioning projects, and a Cancer Training and Education Program. Within the Administrative Core, there are Bioethics Support, Biostatistics/Bioinformatics Support, and Evaluation Support. The Partnership will be guided by an Internal Advisory Committee, which will consist of two distinguished scientists of each institution; an Executive Committee with members of both institutions; and, for each organization, a Partnership Institutional Committee. The Cancer Training and Education Program will reach talented students and faculty at ASU, linking them to established investigators and to the research infrastructure at the UAB CCC, and facilitate faculty, graduate, and undergraduate student and education in the area of cancer research in order to increase the number of minority investigators involved in cancer research. The goal of the Bioethics support will be to provide exceptional bioethics education, training, guidance, and consultation throughout the Partnership. The goal of the Biostatistics/Bioinformatics support will be to address the statistical/bioinformatics needs of the research projects sponsored by the Partnership. The specific aims for the Partnership are: (1) to enhance, by development of junior faculty members, the research and administrative infrastructure to conduct competitive basic and community-based cancer research at ASU; (2) to develop investigators committed to research in cancer disparities at both partnering institutions; and (3) to establish a pipeline of minority cancer disparity researchers and health professionals between ASU and UAB.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: The proposed partnership between Alabama State University (ASU), a Historically Black Colleges and University and the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center (UAB CCC) builds upon current efforts to establish collaborative research infrastructure between the two institutions. Each organization possesses a unique set of strengths that effectively cover inherent weaknesses of the other. Of note, the Partnership is geographically located within the heart of the Southeast, a region with a large, historically underserved, African American population.

"1/2 Howard/Hopkins Intercenter Collaboration in HPV-Associated Cancer Studies ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal aims to improve the translational and community-based HPV-associated cancer research, education, and training at Howard University through collaborative projects and an effective long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center. Human papillomavirus (HPV) accounts for 5.2% of cancer cases worldwide. Several strains of HPV cause a variety of devastating reproductive and oropharyngeal cancers. In the United States, about 26,700 cases of HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually. African American women suffer from a significantly higher incidence rate of HPV-associated cervical, vaginal, and anal cancers compared to their Caucasian counterparts. Additionally, HPV-16 has been identified in approximately 20-30% of head and neck cancers and roughly 56% of oropharynx and oral cavity cancers. Howard University Medical Institutions have a historically Black student body, and its medical and dental facilities participate in direct service to minority populations. However, Howard University faces significant challenges in cancer research and health disparities efforts. Johns Hopkins is committed to providing mentorship and educational resources in cancer research to improve Howard's capacities. Howard is a leading minority-serving institution, while Johns Hopkins is a well-established NCI-designated Cancer Center. An educational effort that brings together Howard doctors and dentists who focus on minorities and Johns Hopkins researchers who study HPV-related cancers will help to address socioeconomic disparities and barriers to cancer health, health education, and health-related professions. Through a set of collaborative pilot projects that include HPV vaccine development in mice models, epidemiology research in a Washington D.C. community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network between the two universities, this collaboration will significantly enhance career development, education, and competitiveness in seeking funding opportunities for Howard students and educators. Specific aims will be: 1) to support collaborative cancer research projects between the Howard University Medical Institutions and the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins; 2) to provide collaborative training and mentoring programs for promoting Howard medical and dental students and faculty in cancer research, 3) to establish education programs that advance the knowledge of cancer research as it applies to etiology, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HPV-associated cancer in the context of minority-serving institutions.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Howard University/Johns Hopkins Partnership in HPV-Related Cancer Research. This effective, long-term partnership with Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center features collaborative pilot projects such as HPV vaccine development, epidemiology research in a community cohort, and an extensive mentoring network to improve the translational and community-based cancer health research capabilities of Howard University.

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)",9357550,U54CA163066,"['ages ', ' Age ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biometry ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Medical Students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Oncology Cancer ', ' oncology ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' infrastructure development ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' ']",NCI,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2017,915178,0.08545320989531527

(1) Strengthen internal and external collaborations and partnerships, particularly those that promote health disparities and translational research: building on existing collaborations with LSU, LSU Health Sciences Center, Tulane University and the Pennington Biomedical Research Center through active partnerships in the Louisiana Cancer Research Consortium and the Louisiana Biomedical Research Network, we will leverage research and mentoring resources in place and establish new ones via partnerships formed within Xavier and between Xavier and RTRN institutions. (2) Reorganize and enhance critical core facilities: we will down size one existing core, create a new core in drug discovery and delivery and add -a bioinformatics facility to our existing Cell and Molecular Biology Core. (3) Increase Xavier's pool of competitive and productive cancer and health disparities researchers who participate in the translational research ""pipeline:"" we will retain previously hired, now competitive, RCMI faculty, hire additional promising junior faculty in critical ""gap"" areas that will improve our capabilities in health disparities and translational research, and provide these faculty with the resources necessary to become/remain competitive. (4)Establish a new pilot project program for cancer/health disparities research: we will use a peer-reviewed mechanism to select projects that will increase Xavier NIH R01 and other R-series grants and support pilot translational research projects for preliminary data collection. (5) Provide targeted administrative services in support of RCMI investigators: we will assure that faculty needs are met with minimal burden, research programs and core services are integrated and encourage teamwork, and that faculty development programs promote professional growth and engagement in health disparities and translational research. Successfully completing these aims will be significant because it will increase the pool of researchers who can more quickly translate bench discoveries into public benefit, particularly in minority communities. The research projects supported by the present RCMI proposal will be innovative as we propose to utilize a programmatic structure involving partnerships with major research universities, an NIH-supported Center for Minority Health and Health Disparities and an NIH-funded center for translational sciences.         PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: Cancer remains a major public health problem, especially among African Americans. Across the U.S., and particularly in Louisiana, the number of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths is significantly higher in African Americans than Caucasians. Xavier's RCMI Center for Cancer Research will continue to support research to improve health outcomes for individuals with cancer, especially those from minority populations.                ",Xavier RCMI Center for Cancer Research ,9460920,G12MD007595,"['Biological Sciences ', ' Life Sciences ', ' Bioscience ', ' Biologic Sciences ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Data Collection ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Drug Design ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Health ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Recording of previous events ', ' History ', ' Investments ', ' Laboratories ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Louisiana ', ' Mentors ', ' Molecular Biology ', ' DNA Molecular Biology ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Peer Review ', ' Pharmacists ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Productivity ', ' Program Development ', ' Public Health ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Support ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Time ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Vision ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Caucasians ', ' white race ', ' Occidental ', ' Caucasoid Race ', ' Caucasoid ', ' Caucasian Race ', ' Caucasian ', ' Drug Delivery Systems ', ' Drug Delivery ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' improved ', ' Area ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Training ', ' Individual ', ' Technology Transfer ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' tool ', ' Knowledge ', ' programs ', ' Cellular biology ', ' cell biology ', ' Scientist ', ' Source ', ' Services ', ' Structure ', ' Support System ', ' Social Support System ', ' drug discovery ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Core Facility ', ' Doctor of Philosophy ', ' PhD ', ' Ph.D. ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Strategic Planning ', ' Clinical Sciences ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' minority health ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' driving force ', ' translational sciences center ', ' translational research center ', ' Center for Translational Science Activities ', ' public health relevance ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics ', ' teacher development ', ' instructor training ', ' faculty professional development ', ' faculty development ', ' Teacher Training ', ' Teacher Preparation ', ' Teacher Educator ', ' Teacher Education ', ' Faculty Training ', ' Faculty Education ', ' Teacher Professional Development ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NIMHD,XAVIER UNIVERSITY OF LOUISIANA,G12,2018,2504744,0.017939423188984536
"MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3)",9550782,U54CA163072,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Medical Students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' minority institution ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' oncology trial ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2018,1333548,0.08545320989531527

"Yes 2 Success Project Summary/Abstract Billions of dollars have been invested over the last decade on efforts to increase diversity in the biomedical workforce yielding limited success. Specifically, African American and Hispanic populations have seen the lowest increase in research workforce representation (NSF 2016). The City of Hope (COH) Comprehensive Cancer Center YES2SUCCESS Program's primary goal is to further develop and maintain a robust pipeline of middle and high school students (grades 6- 12) excited about biomedical research and facilitate undergraduate degree seeking students with summer cancer research experiences. Our program intends to help provide a diverse workforce of students working in underserved populations to reduce cancer health disparities. The program's primary objective is to use a multidisciplinary approach to train qualified candidates, from southern California's underserved populations, in cancer research. Students will be engaged from 6th to 9th grade in order to maintain an adequate pipeline of students for high school and undergraduate summer cancer research experiences. The YES2SUCCESS program will also support the further development of an optimal cancer health disparities research and training environment at the COH, which will reflect our community's unique population and needs. To achieve these goals, the following aims have been identified; 1). Provide a structured outreach program for students grades 6-9; 2). Provide cross-disciplinary research opportunities for students aged 16 years and above; 3). Identify and recruit outstanding racial/ethnic diverse applicants committed to cancer research; 4). Foster educational and collaborative links with school districts and undergraduate colleges and universities to provide a direct training pipeline from grade school through undergraduate programs and increase the number of researchers from underrepresented populations in cancer research. To meet this goal, we will; a). Utilize the COH's unique geographic location, which includes a regional population base comprised of a significant number of residents from underrepresented populations; b). Collaborate with southern California Universities in order to expand recruitment and research opportunities; and c). Draw upon our connections and on- going collaborations with several school districts in the San Gabriel Valley, namely, Azusa, Duarte, El Monte City, and Monrovia unified school districts; whose population base is comprised of a total of 66% underrepresented minority individuals.

"UPRCCC/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (1 of 2) DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research between The University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC). The Partnership proposes structured initiatives to further enhance the research infrastructure within these two institutions to reduce the burden of cancer health disparities. Funds granted in this award will be used to support two full and one pilot research projects. The first full project examines the role of West African ancestry in prostate cancer risk and aggressiveness. Pilot data show an association of several ancestral genetic markers, body mass index, and socioeconomic status with higher-grade prostate cancer. The second full project focuses on magnetic nanoparticle based hyperthermia for ovarian cancer. Pilot project data show a marked decrease in the associated tumor size when treated with nanoparticles. The pilot study is a smoking cessation intervention in oncology clinics. Together, these projects comprise a multidisciplinary research portfolio representing the T l to T3 stages of the translational research continuum. Partnership funds will also be used to: 1) enhance existing collaborations and establish new collaborations; 2) restructure the training pipeline to include customized career development tracks for physicians, scientists and physician scientists interested in cancer medicine to accelerate the development of a critical mass of faculty for the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC); 3) implement a cancer education curriculum; and 4) maintain and expand the Outreach Program, including core services and an outreach research project designed to reduce the burden of colorectal cancer among Puerto Ricans. Thus far, the Partnership has established a dynamic collaborative team that is working towards fortifying and stabilizing the developing infrastructure at the UPRCCC as evidenced by a newly constructed UPRCCC Research Center (opened 6/2009); the UPRCCC hospital will be completed in 2016. Funding for a second renewal is critical to cement and build on the substantial momentum and success achieved by the Partnership over the last ten years. The Partnership is poised to fulfill its long-term goal of positioning the UPRCCC to become a frontrunner in addressing health disparities that affect Hispanic populations across the cancer continuum (prevention, early detection, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship).    RELEVANCE:  This renewal seeks to foster and support an existing collaboration between the UPR and MDACC. By addressing differences in incidence, prevalence, mortality, and burden of cancer that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Training, Education and Outreach. Partnership contributions will also aid in building a stronger national cancer program through the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers.

"2/2:  UHCOP-DLDCCC alliance: Cancer drug discovery/development and education SUMMARY OF P20 APPLICATION Our University of Houston College of Pharmacy (UHCOP)-Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) alliance will develop the infrastructure for a joint drug discovery/development research program to treat cancers with a health disparity and a joint Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). This alliance is built on complementary expertise in cutting-edge cancer drug discovery technologies at DLDCCC/Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and in development of cancer drugs at UHCOP. The UHCOP is a constituent of the University of Houston (UH), which is an institution serving underserved health disparity populations (ISUPS). UHCOP faculty members bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, which is complemented by a wealth of pharmaceutical discovery and development experience, existing programs for undergraduate research, and clinical expertise in working with underserved communities. The DLDCCC, an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, contributes prominent experience and perspective in current cancer treatments and clinical trials, cutting edge drug discovery technologies and expertise, cancer research core facilities, and existing undergraduate and graduate training and education programs, including those for patients with cancer health disparities. UHCOP and BCM are member institutions of the Texas Medical Center, the largest medical center in the world. The UHCOP/DLDCCC alliance will be led by an Administrative Core, comprised of senior and experienced investigators in drug discovery/development and cancer biology research. The Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), composed of experienced and senior cancer research and/or education experts, will guide the alliance to ensure the successful completion of the proposed goals. The Administrative Core and IAC will serve as mentors to Co-Leaders of pilot projects, the CREP, and participating early-stage investigators and underrepresented (UR) trainees. We have selected two co-developed and collaborative Pilot Projects, from a total of six, to demonstrate the feasibility of the joint infrastructure for drug discovery/development research investigating cancers with health disparities. These pilot projects have strong potential to launch bi-institutional, NIH-funded cancer drug discovery/development programs and create state-of-the-art cancer research training opportunities. We have co-developed a synergistic CREP that will encourage and prepare UR trainees to enter careers in cancer research. Through research experiences, cancer-specific curricula, and education outreach efforts to the UR trainees, the CREP will provide a platform for long-term sustained efforts for enlarging the pipeline of UR trainees in cancer research. The ultimate goal of the UHCOP-DLDCCC alliance will be to support a multiplier effect by developing joint infrastructure in drug discovery/development, education, and novel cancer technologies to target the unmet need of tackling cancer health disparities and generate preliminary data for successful subsequent NCI R-type grant funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL) Our collaborative P20 proposal from the University of Houston College of Pharmacy (UHCOP) and the Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) will develop an interdependent infrastructure for a long-term drug discovery/development research program and a cancer research education program (CREP) to address cancers displaying health disparities and to produce preliminary data for subsequent NCI R-type grant opportunities. The alliance will be led by the Administrative Core and an Internal Advisory Committee comprised of senior and experienced investigators, administrators, and/or educators in drug discovery, drug development, and cancer research at UHCOP and DLDCCC/BCM. We have selected two state-of-the-art Pilot Projects that have the strong potential to launch bi-institutional, multi-disciplinary large-scale drug discovery/development research programs in cancers exhibiting health disparities; in parallel, the CREP is co-developed to encourage and prepare underrepresented undergraduate and graduate students to enter careers in cancer research.",2/2:  UHCOP-DLDCCC alliance: Cancer drug discovery/development and education,9635374,P20CA221729,"['inhibitor/antagonist ', ' inhibitor ', ' Antineoplastic Agents ', ' anticancer drug ', ' anticancer agent ', ' anti-cancer drug ', ' Tumor-Specific Treatment Agents ', ' Neoplastic Disease Chemotherapeutic Agents ', ' Cancer Drug ', ' Antineoplastics ', ' Antineoplastic Drugs ', ' Anti-Cancer Agents ', ' Awareness ', ' malignant breast neoplasm ', ' malignant breast tumor ', ' Breast Cancer ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chemistry ', ' Cities ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Cessation of life ', ' Death ', ' Diagnosis ', ' DNA ', ' Deoxyribonucleic Acid ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Exhibits ', ' Pharmacy Faculty ', ' Future ', ' Genome ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health ', ' Primary carcinoma of the liver cells ', ' liver carcinoma ', ' Liver Cells Carcinoma ', ' Hepatoma ', ' Hepatocellular cancer ', ' Hepatocellular Carcinoma ', ' Hepatocarcinoma ', ' Hispanic Americans ', ' Spanish Americans ', ' In Vitro ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Lead ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Libraries ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' Methylation ', ' Mus ', ' Murine ', ' Mice Mammals ', ' Mice ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' Patients ', ' Pharmacy facility ', ' Pharmacies ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Program Development ', ' Proteins ', ' Records ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Students ', ' Technology ', ' Texas ', ' Time ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Administrator ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Ensure ', ' prognostic ', ' Training ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Hormonal Therapy ', ' Endocrine Therapy ', ' hormone therapy ', ' lectures ', ' programs ', ' meetings ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' Peptoids ', ' novel ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' new technology ', ' novel technologies ', ' drug development ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' drug discovery ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Pharmacologic Substance ', ' Pharmacological Substance ', ' Pharmaceuticals ', ' Pharmaceutical Agent ', ' Population Group ', ' Institution ', ' Transcription Coactivator ', ' transcriptional co-activator ', ' transcription co-activator ', ' Transcriptional Coactivator ', ' Transcriptional Activator/Coactivator ', ' Transcriptional Activator ', ' Transcription Factor Coactivator ', ' Transcription Activator ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Data ', ' Education Projects ', ' R25 Program ', ' R25 Mechanism ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Applications Grants ', ' Grant Proposals ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' P20 Grant ', ' Cancer Center Planning Grant ', ' Cancer Survivorship ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' treatment trial ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Population ', ' Prevalence ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' resistant ', ' Resistance ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate research ', ' global methylation ', ' genomewide methylation ', ' genome wide methylation ', ' methylation pattern ', ' training opportunity ', ' education research ', ' small molecule inhibitor ', ' in vivo testing ', ' in vivo evaluation ', ' ']",NCI,BAYLOR COLLEGE OF MEDICINE,P20,2018,258006,0.05464553912529024
"1/2 Langston University- UNTHSC Partnership for Cancer Research and Education With the current US population continuing to grow at its current pace, nearly 50% of the US population in 2050 will be from medically underserved, vulnerable populations. Substantial evidence exists for the underrepresentation of minorities (individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds) in all levels of the biomedical workforce (from the undergraduate level to the professoriate). Racial/ethnic populations demonstrate increased incidence and/or more aggressive disease for specific cancer types. Even when accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors, incidence and mortality differences persist between racial/ethnic populations for some cancer types. Recent studies indicate that these unequal cancer burdens may be due to a complex biology that needs to be investigated to increase our basic understanding of cancer health disparities. There is a lack of diversity in the professional fields of healthcare and research, which strive to treat and eliminate the health disparities that exist in cancer prevalent throughout the United States. This proposal will focus on promoting diversity in individuals engaged cancer research and cancer disparities by developing a partnership between the Institute for Cancer Research at University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) and Langston University (LU), the only historically black college in Oklahoma. The Objective of the proposed partnership is to promote cancer-related research, cancer research experience and cancer education to undergraduate students and junior faculty. Each of the activities will be jointly developed and implemented at LU and UNTHSC. We will meet our objectives through three Specific Aims: Aim 1) Establish an Administrative Core (AC) that will be responsible for the overall implementation, management, and evaluation of the success of the various components of the partnership, Aim 2) Promote interdisciplinary and collaborative cancer research involving faculty from UNTHSC and LU, and support two pilot research projects, and Aim 3) Develop a Cancer Research Education Program (CREP) that provides students and junior faculty with cancer education, cancer research experiences, experimental design, interprofessional education (IPE) and health disparities. Our expectation is that by meeting our objectives, we will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of establishing a long- term partnership between LU and UNTHSC with an ultimate outcome of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cancer. Innovative features of proposed partnership program are (1) focus on the development of research excellence and professionalism in cancer and health disparities among the underrepresented and disadvantageous scholars; (2) extended active coaching integrated with interprofessional training programs and academic training, and (3) developing interdisciplinary cancer research teams. These activities will have a significant impact on increasing the success of URM and other disadvantaged groups in health disparity research related to cancer. Project Narrative There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) Plan and implement a collaborative partnership between Langston University and UNT Health Science Center. 2) Support two collaborative pilot cancer research projects and 3) Provide cancer education, cancer research training and professional development to underrepresented minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds and disabilities who will pursue cancer disparity research.",1/2 Langston University- UNTHSC Partnership for Cancer Research and Education,9633493,P20CA233391,"['Academic Training ', ' Accounting ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mortality ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' cancer education ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' under-represented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' minority student ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' ']",NCI,LANGSTON UNIVERSITY,P20,2018,210731,0.16107893398270742
"Florida Cancer ReTOOL Program for Underrepresented Minority Students ABSTRACT The underrepresentation of minorities in basic, clinical and behavioral research has been viewed as a significant barrier to addressing cancer disparities, and the inclusion of minority populations in clinical trials. Thus, there is a need to develop a cadre of racially and ethnically diverse, well-trained scientists. In this application, we will address the following barriers that underrepresented minorities face for a comprehensive rigorous, and innovative approach that will create opportunities and promote careers in cancer research for underrepresented minority researchers and students: (i) the lack of committed role models, (ii) inadequate mentoring, (iii) insufficient preparation, (iv) low expectations, and (v) not being aware of the culture and idioms of science. To achieve our long-term goal of increasing the pool of underrepresented minority (URM) cancer researchers, our primary objective is to augment, promote and sustain an independent, competitive cancer research training program that creates opportunities and promotes careers in oncology for minority students through the Comprehensive Research Training Opportunities for Outstanding Leaders (C-ReTOOL) program. This program will apprise and culturally sensitize undergraduate and graduate students of the need to reduce the disproportionate cancer burden in minority populations through basic, clinical, and behavioral research conducted in the US, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. The C-ReTOOL program will build on our existing cancer research and training opportunities to grow the number of underrepresented scientists and clinical investigators in higher education and academic leadership.

"Training program to promote diversity in cancer research Summary Disparities in cancer incidence and mortality rates among different ethnic/racial groups has been well recognized; however, research in this area has lagged behind, partly due to a shortage of cancer researchers and physicians from underrepresented minorities. North Carolina is among the most diverse states in the nation, and ranks ninth with respect to African American population. African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Native Americans are 33% of the state's population. Accordingly, there is obvious cancer disparity. Thus, we created the “North Carolina Summer Undergraduate Prostate Cancer Research Program (NC-SUPR)” which offers summer research experiences to undergraduates from two local HBCUs. The program was supported by the Department of Defense for the last two years, and successfully implemented. Based on this fruitful experience, we have arranged a larger consortium of “Cancer Equity Research Training at North Carolina (CERT-NC)” by four Universities, including two local HBCUs. We now propose to create a new R25 training program for promoting diversity of cancer research at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC). The objective of this training program is to promote and enhance diversity of the future cancer research workforce, by providing undergraduates from under-represented populations with opportunities for short-term research experiences. Our Specific Aims are to: (i) Recruit highly qualified underrepresented minority undergraduates through CERT-NC and nationwide; (ii) Engage participants in hands-on research activities in basic and translational laboratories and expose them to cutting-edge cancer research; (iii) Provide mentorship and guidance to participants for their career development; and (iv) Guide students in future career development and track their progress. Our proposed program includes multiple innovative approaches. First, it will build on the experience of the successful NC-SUPR program, while expanding its scope. Second, the program will use the unique consortium, CERT-NC, which consists of WFBCCC, two local HBCUs, and another regional college with a large enrollment of Native Americans. Third, we will implement the “Ambassador program”, which provides students with community outreach experience. Fourth, the program's distinguished faculty will provide education so that participants achieve a grasp of cancer biology basics and learn about state-of-the-art technologies for precision medicine and drug development. Fifth, the program offers career guidance from underrepresented minority faculty as “Career mentors”. Lastly, the program will be strengthened by interactions with other summer research programs at Wake Forest University. Thus, participants will interact with other underrepresented minority students and establish peer networks for future career development. Our program features faculty committed to mentorship and a diverse scientific environment with exposure to cutting-edge approaches to cancer biology, and can implement proven methods for recruitment and follow-up for efficient and effective administration of a vibrant training program. Narrative We propose a new program, “Cancer Equity Research Training at North Carolina (CERT-NC)”, to promote diversity in the future cancer research workforce by providing undergraduates from under-represented minorities with summer research experiences.

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)",9542223,U54CA163066,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Medical Students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' minority institution ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' oncology trial ', ' ']",NCI,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2018,919154,0.08545320989531527

"1/2:  UHCOP-DLDCCC alliance: Cancer drug discovery/development and education SUMMARY OF P20 APPLICATION Our University of Houston College of Pharmacy (UHCOP)-Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) alliance will develop the infrastructure for a joint drug discovery/development research program to treat cancers with a health disparity and a joint Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). This alliance is built on complementary expertise in cutting-edge cancer drug discovery technologies at DLDCCC/Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and in development of cancer drugs at UHCOP. The UHCOP is a constituent of the University of Houston (UH), which is an institution serving underserved health disparity populations (ISUPS). UHCOP faculty members bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, which is complemented by a wealth of pharmaceutical discovery and development experience, existing programs for undergraduate research, and clinical expertise in working with underserved communities. The DLDCCC, an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, contributes prominent experience and perspective in current cancer treatments and clinical trials, cutting edge drug discovery technologies and expertise, cancer research core facilities, and existing undergraduate and graduate training and education programs, including those for patients with cancer health disparities. UHCOP and BCM are member institutions of the Texas Medical Center, the largest medical center in the world. The UHCOP/DLDCCC alliance will be led by an Administrative Core, comprised of senior and experienced investigators in drug discovery/development and cancer biology research. The Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), composed of experienced and senior cancer research and/or education experts, will guide the alliance to ensure the successful completion of the proposed goals. The Administrative Core and IAC will serve as mentors to Co-Leaders of pilot projects, the CREP, and participating early-stage investigators and underrepresented (UR) trainees. We have selected two co-developed and collaborative Pilot Projects, from a total of six, to demonstrate the feasibility of the joint infrastructure for drug discovery/development research investigating cancers with health disparities. These pilot projects have strong potential to launch bi-institutional, NIH-funded cancer drug discovery/development programs and create state-of-the-art cancer research training opportunities. We have co-developed a synergistic CREP that will encourage and prepare UR trainees to enter careers in cancer research. Through research experiences, cancer-specific curricula, and education outreach efforts to the UR trainees, the CREP will provide a platform for long-term sustained efforts for enlarging the pipeline of UR trainees in cancer research. The ultimate goal of the UHCOP-DLDCCC alliance will be to support a multiplier effect by developing joint infrastructure in drug discovery/development, education, and novel cancer technologies to target the unmet need of tackling cancer health disparities and generate preliminary data for successful subsequent NCI R-type grant funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL) Our collaborative P20 proposal from the University of Houston College of Pharmacy (UHCOP) and the Dan L.

"2/2 NCCU-LCCC Partnership in Cancer Research DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Abstract: The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) will continue their effective and mutually beneficial partnership focusing on African-American health disparities. During the past 13 years NCI funding has firmly established the Partnership building on complementary institutional strengths, conducting molecular and population-based cancer research and training of junior faculty and students. This Comprehensive Partnership to Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) application builds upon the foundation already established through the previous U54 funding to meet the challenge of disparities in cancer incidence and mortality in North Carolina and the US through cancer research, education and community outreach. Our goals are to: (1) strengthen cancer research capacity at NCCU providing NCCU scientists mentorship and collaborative opportunities to compete for NCI grants; (2) enrich the capacity of NCCU and LCCC to further explore mechanisms underlying the disproportionate incidence of cancer mortality and morbidity between African Americans and Caucasian Americans, using both molecular and population-based approaches; (3) increase the number of NCCU scientists focused on cancer research as well as the education of minority undergraduate and graduate students in cancer research; (4) increase the faculty at the UNC LCCC focused on minority disparities research; and (5) create long-term collaborations between basic, public health, and translational scientists from NCCU and UNC LCCC. The strengths of each institution are uniquely positioned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: Two full and one pilot projects in community intervention and population science, one full and one pilot project in basic/translational cancer research in diseases with a higher incidence in African Americans, and 3 cores: Outreach, Research Education, and Histopathology. The partnership combines the expertise and resources of LCCC in population/public health sciences emphasizing disparities in North Carolina, genomics, cancer biology and cancer education and NCCU's demonstrated interest and faculty with minority health disparities research particularly in Durham NC, the state-funded NCCU units that allow faculty release from teaching and the emphasis on reaching minority populations and developing the careers of, faculty and students. These complementary institutional strengths will assure that the Partnership builds the infrastructure necessary for a lasting collaborative research, effective community outreach and a substantial contribution to our understanding of minority disparities. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE    Narrative The North Carolina Central University (NCCU) and the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center (LCCC) at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) will continue their effective and mutually beneficial partnership focusing on African-American health disparities. During the past 13 years NCI funding has firmly established the Partnership building on complementary institutional strengths, conducting molecular and population-based cancer research and training of junior faculty and students. This Comprehensive Partnership to Advance Cancer Health Equity (CPACHE) application builds upon the foundation already established through the previous U54 funding to meet the challenge of disparities in cancer incidence and mortality in North Carolina and the US through cancer research, education and community outreach. Our goals are to: (1) strengthen cancer research capacity at NCCU providing NCCU scientists mentorship and collaborative opportunities to compete for NCI grants; (2) enrich the capacity of NCCU and LCCC to further explore mechanisms underlying the disproportionate incidence of cancer mortality and morbidity between African Americans and Caucasian Americans, using both molecular and population-based approaches; (3) increase the number of NCCU scientists focused on cancer research as well as the education of minority undergraduate and graduate students in cancer research; (4) increase the faculty at the UNC LCCC focused on minority disparities research; and (5) create long-term collaborations between basic, public health, and translational scientists from NCCU and UNC LCCC. The strengths of each institution are uniquely positioned to overcome the weaknesses found in the other to achieve these priorities. Specific collaborative components of the proposal include: Two full and one pilot projects in community intervention and population science, one full and one pilot project in basic/translational cancer research in diseases with a higher incidence in African Americans, and 3 cores: Outreach, Research Education, and Histopathology. The NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, UNC Lineberger provides expertise and resources in population/public health sciences emphasizing disparities in North Carolina, genomics, cancer biology a large clinical and translational human trials effort and multiple cancer education opportunities. NCCU provides demonstrated interest and faculty with minority health disparities research particularly in Durham NC, state-funded NCCU research units that allow faculty release from teaching, excellent research space, a large undergraduate population with interests in cancer education, faculty with selected expertise in disparities and the emphasis on reaching minority populations and developing the careers of faculty and students. These complementary institutional strengths will assure that the Partnership builds the infrastructure necessary for a lasting collaborative research, effective community outreach and a substantial contribution to our understanding of minority disparities.",2/2 NCCU-LCCC Partnership in Cancer Research,9548165,U54CA156733,"['American Cancer Society ', ' Attention ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environmental Exposure ', ' Eye ', ' Eyeball ', ' Faculty ', ' Foundations ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Health Promotion ', ' promoting health ', ' Salutogenesis ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Human ', ' Modern Man ', ' Incidence ', ' Leadership ', ' Mentorship ', ' Morbidity - disease rate ', ' Morbidity ', ' mortality ', ' North Carolina ', ' Pilot Projects ', ' pilot study ', ' Public Health ', ' Recurrence ', ' Recurrent ', ' Research ', ' Research Institute ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' Socioeconomic Factors ', ' Students ', ' Educational process of instructing ', ' Teaching ', ' Tissues ', ' Body Tissues ', ' Universities ', ' African American ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' therapy failure ', ' Treatment Failure ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Susceptibility ', ' Predisposition ', ' Training ', ' white American ', ' caucasian American ', ' Funding ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' Genetic ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Complex ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' cohort ', ' Histopathology ', ' member ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' theories ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' Intervention ', ' interventional strategy ', ' Intervention Strategies ', ' Genomics ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' U-Series Cooperative Agreements ', ' Cooperative Agreements ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Health Sciences ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' Population Sciences ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Infrastructure ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Outreach Research ', ' University of North Carolina Chapel Hill Lineberger Cancer Center ', ' UNC Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Molecular ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' minority health ', ' community intervention ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Population ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' public health relevance ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' under-represented student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' full professor ', ' senior faculty ', ' training opportunity ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' education research ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' minority student ', ' minority communities ', ' translational researcher ', ' translational investigator ', ' translational scientist ', ' translational cancer research ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,U54,2018,1073101,0.12556774309397287
"UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request funding for a five-year renewal of our very successful Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) program (grant 5R25 CA76023) that has been funded by NCI's R25E program since 1999. CaRES provides paid short summer cancer research internships for University of Alabama School of Medicine (UAB) medical students, UAB public health students, and other UAB graduate health professional students, all of whom are American citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. In its 15th year, CaRES has supported over 500 students to date. Typically first-year medical students and graduate students participate, but students who hold a letter of acceptance qualify for CaRES in the summer prior to enrolling in their degree program. CaRES projects have been conducted on the UAB campus under the guidance of UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center faculty members. If we are granted additional funding we will enhance CaRES in four ways. We will broaden student eligibility by recruiting health professional students from three Alabama universities (University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University) in addition to UAB; we will increase the number of opportunities for cancer research in genomics and translational research by basing some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama; we will tighten our student-preceptor research agreements by means of a mentoring contract; and we will increase the depth and breadth of instruction in career development and in the responsible conduct of research through an expanded seminar series and by affording students the opportunity to participate in other seminars, workshops, and courses. With these innovations we believe that CaRES will become nationally recognized as a premier R25E short- term cancer research training program. Further, we believe that our innovations will ignite collaborative cancer research and service activity in Alabama, a state characterized by low income, low education, and a large minority population that is medically under-served and at high risk for cancer and other chronic diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We request funding to continue our ""CaRES"" cancer research training program that pays UAB medical students and public health students to do summer cancer research projects. For the first time we will include students from the University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University in the CaRES program; and we will base some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville. We anticipate that by virtue of their CaRES research experiences some of the participating students will choose cancer research careers, accomplishing the main goal of the CaRES program.",UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students,9535190,R25CA076023,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Alabama ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Professional Education ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Institutes ', ' Internships ', ' intern ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' medical schools ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' Students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Pharmacy Students ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Workshop ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Letters ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' programs ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Public Health Students ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' High-Risk Cancer ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Translational Research ', ' Process ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' Instruction ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' personalized medicine ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' Degree program ', ' Student recruitment ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R25,2018,347849,0.1093745183014248
"2/2 Langston University-UNTHSC Partnership for Cancer Research and Education Project Summary (Overall) With the current US population continuing to grow at its current pace, nearly 50% of the US population in 2050 will be from medically underserved, vulnerable populations. Substantial evidence exists for the underrepresentation of minorities (individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds) in all levels of the biomedical workforce (from the undergraduate level to the professoriate). Racial/ethnic populations demonstrate increased incidence and/or more aggressive disease for specific cancer types. Even when accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors, incidence and mortality differences persist between racial/ethnic populations for some cancer types. Recent studies indicate that these unequal cancer burdens may be due to a complex biology that needs to be investigated to increase our basic understanding of cancer health disparities. There is a lack of diversity in the professional fields of healthcare and research, which strive to treat and eliminate the health disparities that exist in cancer prevalent throughout the United States. This proposal will focus on promoting diversity in individuals engaged cancer research and cancer disparities by developing a partnership between the Institute for Cancer Research at University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) and Langston University (LU), the only historically black college in Oklahoma. The Objective of the proposed partnership is to promote cancer-related research, cancer research experience and cancer education to undergraduate students and junior faculty. Each of the activities will be jointly developed and implemented at LU and UNTHSC. We will meet our objectives through three Specific Aims: Aim 1) Establish an Administrative Core (AC) that will be responsible for the overall implementation, management, and evaluation of the success of the various components of the partnership, Aim 2) Promote interdisciplinary and collaborative cancer research involving faculty from UNTHSC and LU, and support two pilot research projects, and Aim 3) Develop a Cancer Research Education Program (CREP) that provides students and junior faculty with cancer education, cancer research experiences, experimental design, interprofessional education (IPE) and health disparities. Our expectation is that by meeting our objectives, we will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of establishing a long- term partnership between LU and UNTHSC with an ultimate outcome of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cancer. Innovative features of proposed partnership program are (1) focus on the development of research excellence and professionalism in cancer and health disparities among the underrepresented and disadvantageous scholars; (2) extended active coaching integrated with interprofessional training programs and academic training, and (3) developing interdisciplinary cancer research teams. These activities will have a significant impact on increasing the success of URM and other disadvantaged groups in health disparity research related to cancer. Project Narrative There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) Plan and implement a collaborative partnership between Langston University and UNT Health Science Center. 2) Support two collaborative pilot cancer research projects and 3) Provide cancer education, cancer research training and professional development to underrepresented minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds and disabilities who will pursue cancer disparity research.",2/2 Langston University-UNTHSC Partnership for Cancer Research and Education,9630935,P20CA233355,"['Academic Training ', ' Accounting ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' disabled people ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Handicapped ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' treatment access ', ' health services availability ', ' health service access ', ' care access ', ' availability of services ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' access to treatment ', ' access to services ', ' access to health services ', ' Access to Care ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mortality ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Racial Group ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' population diversity ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' diverse populations ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' cancer education ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' vulnerable group ', ' health disparity ', ' disparity in health ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-represented minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' innovation ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' under-represented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' minority student ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,P20,2018,255958,0.1606877786892366
"UPR/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2) OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This competitive renewal of the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (Partnership) between the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) will: 1) solidify, strengthen, and expand the relationship between UPR and MDACC; and 2) leverage the breadth and strengths of an experienced and integrated Partnership in transition of the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) towards a long-term overall goal: recognition of UPRCCC as an NCI-designated cancer center. To address some of the most profound cancer health disparities in Puerto Rico and Texas, the Partnership will establish an Infection-Driven Malignancies Program for Advancing Careers and Translational Sciences (IMPACT). This application represents a partnership in which both institutions profit from sharing distinct expertise to mutually benefit in implementation of integrated team science, outreach, education and career development initiatives. To facilitate UPRCCC’s transition towards NCI-designation, the UPR PIs led the development of the specific aims with support of the MDACC PIs. The Specific Aims for the renewal are: 1) Develop a multidisciplinary research portfolio focused on health disparities derived from infection-driven malignancies; 2) Increase the number of Hispanic students pursuing careers in laboratory and population- based cancer research to produce a critical mass of clinicians, scientists, and physician-scientists, who specialize in cancer research, with emphasis on cancer health disparities in underrepresented minorities and underserved communities; 3) Strengthen sustainable collaborations among all the stakeholders to develop and promote key community outreach, education, and interventions aimed at reducing cancer rates and emphasizing vaccinations against malignancy linked infections, among Hispanic/Latino populations in PR, TX, and elsewhere; 4) Leverage strategic collaborations with NCI-designated cancer centers to augment the cancer research capacity of the UPR and the UPRCCC; and 5) Provide professional support and development tools through the a) Administration; b) Planning and Evaluation; and c) Shared Resources Cores designed to nurture and optimize the Partnership’s research, education, and outreach agendas in support of the long-term goal of an NCI-designated Cancer Center. Key elements of this application to advance the Partnership include: 1) Multidisciplinary collaborative research projects focused on IMPACT that represent stages of the translational research continuum; 2) A comprehensive cancer-focused training and career development core; 3) The development of a dual MD/MPH degree to address specific cancers disproportionately affecting Hispanic populations; 4) Outreach efforts to build, educate, and advocate for broad HPV vaccination programs; and 5) a DATAOmics Core that builds infrastructure. This initiative will strengthen the overall cancer research enterprise in infection-driven malignancies in both PR and TX, and will support the implementation of UPRCCC’s roadmap to submission of a Cancer Center Support Grant (P30) for NCI designation. NARRATIVE STATEMENT Hispanics have an increased risk of infection-driven malignancies, including gastric cancer and HIV- and HPV- related malignancies. To address the increased risk factors and burden of infection-driven cancers that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Education, and Outreach. Partnership contributions, including the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers, will help build a stronger national cancer research and prevention program.",UPR/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2),9848093,U54CA096297,"['Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laws ', ' stomach pylorus cancer ', ' stomach fundus cancer ', ' malignant stomach tumor ', ' Stomach Cancer ', ' Malignant Gastric Tumor ', ' Malignant Gastric Neoplasm ', ' Gastric Pylorus Cancer ', ' Gastric Fundus Cancer ', ' Gastric Cardia Cancer ', ' Gastric Cancer ', ' Gastric Body Cancer ', ' malignant stomach neoplasm ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' Physicians ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' career ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' Prevention program ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignancy ', ' HPV-related cancer ', ' HPV-associated malignancy ', ' HPV-associated cancer ', ' HPV-Related Malignancy ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Program ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' CCSG ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Translational Research Working Group ', ' tool development ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Infrastructure ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO MED SCIENCES,U54,2019,1434449,0.10924237009844297

"CDU-UCLA Cancer Center Partnership to Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Charles R. Drew University (CDU) and the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center has forged a strong and sustainable partnership to ""Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities in minority and underserved populations"". Our partnership began in 2003 with support from the National Cancer Institute to initiate U56 collaboration, followed by a U54 award in 2009 to establish a long lasting comprehensive partnership. In addition, institutional investment from UCLA-JCCC and CDU has made it possible for a sustainable partnership to accomplish significant goals related to reducing cancer health disparities.  Hence, in our renewal application, we propose to continue the momentum and do more to address cancer health disparities in our communities in Los Angeles County, and in particular South Los Angeles. The overarching goals of the CDU-UCLA Cancer Partnership Program are to significantly increase the number of scientists in cancer research and to enhance the cancer research and infrastructure capacity at Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science that will continue to address significant disparities in cancer among minority populations. Supported and implemented by an Administrative Core, Planning and Evaluation Core, and Research Projects, Research Education Core, Outreach Core, and Shared Resources Core. The five priorities for the partnership are: Priority 1: Increase the number and quality of cancer research projects at CDU by supporting full and pilot projects and increase the number of cancer researchers at CDU. Priority 2: Enhance research capability of the CDU's Integrated Clinical and Biomarker/ Biorepository Tissue and Data Resources focused on cancer health disparities research, education and outreach among underrepresented populations. Priority 3: Create institutional capacity at CDU for performing cancer-related clinical trials by leveraging the community and existing clinical research facilities and resources.

"Florida Cancer ReTOOL Program for Underrepresented Minority Students ABSTRACT The underrepresentation of minorities in basic, clinical and behavioral research has been viewed as a significant barrier to addressing cancer disparities, and the inclusion of minority populations in clinical trials. Thus, there is a need to develop a cadre of racially and ethnically diverse, well-trained scientists. In this application, we will address the following barriers that underrepresented minorities face for a comprehensive rigorous, and innovative approach that will create opportunities and promote careers in cancer research for underrepresented minority researchers and students: (i) the lack of committed role models, (ii) inadequate mentoring, (iii) insufficient preparation, (iv) low expectations, and (v) not being aware of the culture and idioms of science. To achieve our long-term goal of increasing the pool of underrepresented minority (URM) cancer researchers, our primary objective is to augment, promote and sustain an independent, competitive cancer research training program that creates opportunities and promotes careers in oncology for minority students through the Comprehensive Research Training Opportunities for Outstanding Leaders (C-ReTOOL) program. This program will apprise and culturally sensitize undergraduate and graduate students of the need to reduce the disproportionate cancer burden in minority populations through basic, clinical, and behavioral research conducted in the US, Europe, Africa and the Caribbean. The C-ReTOOL program will build on our existing cancer research and training opportunities to grow the number of underrepresented scientists and clinical investigators in higher education and academic leadership.

"Training program to promote diversity in cancer research Summary Disparities in cancer incidence and mortality rates among different ethnic/racial groups has been well recognized; however, research in this area has lagged behind, partly due to a shortage of cancer researchers and physicians from underrepresented minorities. North Carolina is among the most diverse states in the nation, and ranks ninth with respect to African American population. African Americans, Hispanics/Latinos, and Native Americans are 33% of the state's population. Accordingly, there is obvious cancer disparity. Thus, we created the “North Carolina Summer Undergraduate Prostate Cancer Research Program (NC-SUPR)” which offers summer research experiences to undergraduates from two local HBCUs. The program was supported by the Department of Defense for the last two years, and successfully implemented. Based on this fruitful experience, we have arranged a larger consortium of “Cancer Equity Research Training at North Carolina (CERT-NC)” by four Universities, including two local HBCUs. We now propose to create a new R25 training program for promoting diversity of cancer research at Wake Forest Baptist Comprehensive Cancer Center (WFBCCC). The objective of this training program is to promote and enhance diversity of the future cancer research workforce, by providing undergraduates from under-represented populations with opportunities for short-term research experiences. Our Specific Aims are to: (i) Recruit highly qualified underrepresented minority undergraduates through CERT-NC and nationwide; (ii) Engage participants in hands-on research activities in basic and translational laboratories and expose them to cutting-edge cancer research; (iii) Provide mentorship and guidance to participants for their career development; and (iv) Guide students in future career development and track their progress. Our proposed program includes multiple innovative approaches. First, it will build on the experience of the successful NC-SUPR program, while expanding its scope. Second, the program will use the unique consortium, CERT-NC, which consists of WFBCCC, two local HBCUs, and another regional college with a large enrollment of Native Americans. Third, we will implement the “Ambassador program”, which provides students with community outreach experience. Fourth, the program's distinguished faculty will provide education so that participants achieve a grasp of cancer biology basics and learn about state-of-the-art technologies for precision medicine and drug development. Fifth, the program offers career guidance from underrepresented minority faculty as “Career mentors”. Lastly, the program will be strengthened by interactions with other summer research programs at Wake Forest University. Thus, participants will interact with other underrepresented minority students and establish peer networks for future career development. Our program features faculty committed to mentorship and a diverse scientific environment with exposure to cutting-edge approaches to cancer biology, and can implement proven methods for recruitment and follow-up for efficient and effective administration of a vibrant training program. Narrative We propose a new program, “Cancer Equity Research Training at North Carolina (CERT-NC)”, to promote diversity in the future cancer research workforce by providing undergraduates from under-represented minorities with summer research experiences. A consortium of four universities, including two local HBCUs and another local college with a large enrollment of Native Americans, will host participants.

"Yes 2 Success Project Summary/Abstract Billions of dollars have been invested over the last decade on efforts to increase diversity in the biomedical workforce yielding limited success. Specifically, African American and Hispanic populations have seen the lowest increase in research workforce representation (NSF 2016). The City of Hope (COH) Comprehensive Cancer Center YES2SUCCESS Program's primary goal is to further develop and maintain a robust pipeline of middle and high school students (grades 6- 12) excited about biomedical research and facilitate undergraduate degree seeking students with summer cancer research experiences. Our program intends to help provide a diverse workforce of students working in underserved populations to reduce cancer health disparities. The program's primary objective is to use a multidisciplinary approach to train qualified candidates, from southern California's underserved populations, in cancer research. Students will be engaged from 6th to 9th grade in order to maintain an adequate pipeline of students for high school and undergraduate summer cancer research experiences. The YES2SUCCESS program will also support the further development of an optimal cancer health disparities research and training environment at the COH, which will reflect our community's unique population and needs. To achieve these goals, the following aims have been identified; 1). Provide a structured outreach program for students grades 6-9; 2). Provide cross-disciplinary research opportunities for students aged 16 years and above; 3). Identify and recruit outstanding racial/ethnic diverse applicants committed to cancer research; 4). Foster educational and collaborative links with school districts and undergraduate colleges and universities to provide a direct training pipeline from grade school through undergraduate programs and increase the number of researchers from underrepresented populations in cancer research. To meet this goal, we will; a). Utilize the COH's unique geographic location, which includes a regional population base comprised of a significant number of residents from underrepresented populations; b). Collaborate with southern California Universities in order to expand recruitment and research opportunities; and c). Draw upon our connections and on- going collaborations with several school districts in the San Gabriel Valley, namely, Azusa, Duarte, El Monte City, and Monrovia unified school districts; whose population base is comprised of a total of 66% underrepresented minority individuals. Project Narrative This Youth Enjoy Science (YES) grant is designed to leverage our long-standing and successful programs of education and training in cancer research at the City of Hope (COH) Comprehensive Cancer Center. The program’s primary objective is to train candidates from diverse backgrounds in cancer research with a multidisciplinary approach in southern California’s underserved populations; students will be engaged from 6th to 12th grade in order to maintain an adequate pipeline of students for high school and undergraduate summer cancer research experiences.

"1/2 Langston University- UNTHSC Partnership for Cancer Research and Education With the current US population continuing to grow at its current pace, nearly 50% of the US population in 2050 will be from medically underserved, vulnerable populations. Substantial evidence exists for the underrepresentation of minorities (individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds) in all levels of the biomedical workforce (from the undergraduate level to the professoriate). Racial/ethnic populations demonstrate increased incidence and/or more aggressive disease for specific cancer types. Even when accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors, incidence and mortality differences persist between racial/ethnic populations for some cancer types. Recent studies indicate that these unequal cancer burdens may be due to a complex biology that needs to be investigated to increase our basic understanding of cancer health disparities. There is a lack of diversity in the professional fields of healthcare and research, which strive to treat and eliminate the health disparities that exist in cancer prevalent throughout the United States. This proposal will focus on promoting diversity in individuals engaged cancer research and cancer disparities by developing a partnership between the Institute for Cancer Research at University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) and Langston University (LU), the only historically black college in Oklahoma. The Objective of the proposed partnership is to promote cancer-related research, cancer research experience and cancer education to undergraduate students and junior faculty. Each of the activities will be jointly developed and implemented at LU and UNTHSC. We will meet our objectives through three Specific Aims: Aim 1) Establish an Administrative Core (AC) that will be responsible for the overall implementation, management, and evaluation of the success of the various components of the partnership, Aim 2) Promote interdisciplinary and collaborative cancer research involving faculty from UNTHSC and LU, and support two pilot research projects, and Aim 3) Develop a Cancer Research Education Program (CREP) that provides students and junior faculty with cancer education, cancer research experiences, experimental design, interprofessional education (IPE) and health disparities. Our expectation is that by meeting our objectives, we will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of establishing a long- term partnership between LU and UNTHSC with an ultimate outcome of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cancer.

"UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students ﻿    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We request funding for a five-year renewal of our very successful Cancer Research Experiences for Students (CaRES) program (grant 5R25 CA76023) that has been funded by NCI's R25E program since 1999. CaRES provides paid short summer cancer research internships for University of Alabama School of Medicine (UAB) medical students, UAB public health students, and other UAB graduate health professional students, all of whom are American citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. In its 15th year, CaRES has supported over 500 students to date. Typically first-year medical students and graduate students participate, but students who hold a letter of acceptance qualify for CaRES in the summer prior to enrolling in their degree program. CaRES projects have been conducted on the UAB campus under the guidance of UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center faculty members. If we are granted additional funding we will enhance CaRES in four ways. We will broaden student eligibility by recruiting health professional students from three Alabama universities (University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University) in addition to UAB; we will increase the number of opportunities for cancer research in genomics and translational research by basing some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville, Alabama; we will tighten our student-preceptor research agreements by means of a mentoring contract; and we will increase the depth and breadth of instruction in career development and in the responsible conduct of research through an expanded seminar series and by affording students the opportunity to participate in other seminars, workshops, and courses. With these innovations we believe that CaRES will become nationally recognized as a premier R25E short- term cancer research training program. Further, we believe that our innovations will ignite collaborative cancer research and service activity in Alabama, a state characterized by low income, low education, and a large minority population that is medically under-served and at high risk for cancer and other chronic diseases. PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE: We request funding to continue our ""CaRES"" cancer research training program that pays UAB medical students and public health students to do summer cancer research projects. For the first time we will include students from the University of South Alabama, Auburn University, and Samford University in the CaRES program; and we will base some CaRES projects at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology in Huntsville. We anticipate that by virtue of their CaRES research experiences some of the participating students will choose cancer research careers, accomplishing the main goal of the CaRES program.",UAB Cancer Research Experiences for Students,9763450,R25CA076023,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Alabama ', ' Biotechnology ', ' Biotech ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' chronic disorder ', ' Chronic Illness ', ' Chronic Disease ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Professional Education ', ' Protocol Screening ', ' Eligibility ', ' Eligibility Determination ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Institutes ', ' intern ', ' Internships ', ' Literature ', ' Mentors ', ' Methods ', ' Methodology ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Pharmacy Students ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Universities ', ' Veterinary Medicine ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Clinical ', ' Medical ', ' Series ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Letters ', ' Contracts ', ' Contracting Opportunities ', ' programs ', ' Benchmarking ', ' Best Practice Analysis ', ' interest ', ' meetings ', ' Services ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' American ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' university student ', ' college student ', ' member ', ' Agreement ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' Prevention ', ' Modeling ', ' career development ', ' Genomics ', ' Public Health Students ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Institution ', ' Low income ', ' Data ', ' High-Risk Cancer ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Enrollment ', ' enroll ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Process ', ' Health Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Instruction ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' public health relevance ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' personalized medicine ', ' personalized treatment ', ' personalized therapy ', ' personalization of treatment ', ' Faculty Recruitment ', ' teacher recruitment ', ' recruit teachers ', ' Minority Recruitment ', ' recruiting minorities ', ' Degree program ', ' Student recruitment ', ' recruit ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA AT BIRMINGHAM,R25,2019,330018,0.1093745183014248
"1/2 CCNY-MSKCC Partnership for Cancer Research, Education and Community Outreach The CCNY-MSKCC Partnership has successfully created a mutually beneficial, cross-institutional collaboration that has emphasized research across the translational continuum, the creation of an education pipeline for attracting minority and low-income students to careers in cancer research, and the establishment of community networks and resources for conducting linguistically and culturally-responsive community engaged research among diverse, at-risk populations. Over the last five years, areas of particular strength have been developed, including: 1) rich collaborations between engineers and computer scientists at CCNY and clinicians and imaging experts at MSKCC to develop innovative solutions to improve cancer care, and 2) sustainable, translational health disparities research and activities that directly benefit underserved communities in New York, and serve as national models in terms of: a) screening / identification of cancer risk factors that disproportionately affect minorities; b) socioeconomic determinants of access to, and successful completion of, treatment; and c) policy change. Consistent with these areas of emphases, we propose two full projects that focus on: 1) Tumor ensemble models to predict tumor dormancy and reactivation and testing how these models perform across various ethnic cell lines, e.g., triple negative tumors that disproportionately affect African American women and 2) Characterizing the Role of ATM in Immunoglobulin Gene Diversification and Genome Stability. Two proposed pilot projects include: 1) Raman spectroscopy with heavy water labeling and multiphoton microscopy to allow early detection of breast cancer subtypes, including triple negative cancers and 2) Development of Mechanical Interventions to Enhance Drug Delivery to Bone Tumors. New innovative Partnership components include: 1) development of the Linguistic and Cultural Responsiveness Shared Resource Core; 2) formation of the Engineering Health Disparities working group; and 3) new educational programs including the Scholars for the Future program and the Certificate for Medical Translation and Interpretation. The Partnership specific aims are to: 1) Continue to develop outstanding cancer research programs in health disparities, biomedical engineering, computer science / medical imaging, cancer cell biology, and immunology along the Translational Research Continuum; 2) collaborate with diverse communities to conduct and facilitate trailblazing cancer disparities research, and outreach, education, risk reduction, and navigation activities to define and address cancer disparities, with the goal of improving cancer care in the large, medically underserved local and national communities; 3) continue to develop and expand educational opportunities in a robust translational cancer research environment to attract and retain students interested in cancer research (particularly minority and low income students); these opportunities will be enhanced by educational opportunities and increased mentorship and support; and 4) expand and integrate the personnel, resources, and environment needed for scientific collaboration across institutions and influence institutional policies in support of this objective. Narrative This proposal describes our plans to continue and enhance the City College of New York - Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Partnership for Cancer Research, Education and Community Outreach. The CCNY- MSKCC Partnership is a mutually beneficial, cross-institutional collaboration that has promoted translational research, created an education pipeline for minority and low-income students to advance in cancer research careers, and has established community networks and resources for conducting culturally-responsive community engaged research among diverse, at-risk populations in the New

"CDU-UCLA Cancer Center Partnership to Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Charles R. Drew University (CDU) and the UCLA Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center has forged a strong and sustainable partnership to ""Eliminate Cancer Health Disparities in minority and underserved populations"". Our partnership began in 2003 with support from the National Cancer Institute to initiate U56 collaboration, followed by a U54 award in 2009 to establish a long lasting comprehensive partnership. In addition, institutional investment from UCLA-JCCC and CDU has made it possible for a sustainable partnership to accomplish significant goals related to reducing cancer health disparities.  Hence, in our renewal application, we propose to continue the momentum and do more to address cancer health disparities in our communities in Los Angeles County, and in particular South Los Angeles. The overarching goals of the CDU-UCLA Cancer Partnership Program are to significantly increase the number of scientists in cancer research and to enhance the cancer research and infrastructure capacity at Charles Drew University of Medicine and Science that will continue to address significant disparities in cancer among minority populations. Supported and implemented by an Administrative Core, Planning and Evaluation Core, and Research Projects, Research Education Core, Outreach Core, and Shared Resources Core. The five priorities for the partnership are: Priority 1: Increase the number and quality of cancer research projects at CDU by supporting full and pilot projects and increase the number of cancer researchers at CDU. Priority 2: Enhance research capability of the CDU's Integrated Clinical and Biomarker/ Biorepository Tissue and Data Resources focused on cancer health disparities research, education and outreach among underrepresented populations. Priority 3: Create institutional capacity at CDU for performing cancer-related clinical trials by leveraging the community and existing clinical research facilities and resources. Priority 4: Expose undergraduate and medical students, fellows, and faculty to cancer research and encourage them to pursue or advance their careers in this area, and implement a formalized mentorship program whereby junior research investigators are counseled and mentored during their career development. Priority 5: Bring culturally and linguistically appropriate cancer research information to the community and increase community capacity to develop and implement culturally appropriate health prevention strategies through community-partnered participatory research.

"2/2 CCNY-MSKCC Partnership for Cancer Research, Education and Community Outreach The CCNY-MSKCC Partnership has successfully created a mutually beneficial, cross-institutional collaboration that has emphasized research across the translational continuum, the creation of an education pipeline for attracting minority and low-income students to careers in cancer research, and the establishment of community networks and resources for conducting linguistically and culturally-responsive community engaged research among diverse, at-risk populations. Over the last five years, areas of particular strength have been developed, including: 1) rich collaborations between engineers and computer scientists at CCNY and clinicians and imaging experts at MSKCC to develop innovative solutions to improve cancer care, and 2) sustainable, translational health disparities research and activities that directly benefit underserved communities in New York, and serve as national models in terms of: a) screening / identification of cancer risk factors that disproportionately affect minorities; b) socioeconomic determinants of access to, and successful completion of, treatment; and c) policy change. Consistent with these areas of emphases, we propose two full projects that focus on: 1) Tumor ensemble models to predict tumor dormancy and reactivation and testing how these models perform across various ethnic cell lines, e.g., triple negative tumors that disproportionately affect African American women and 2) Characterizing the Role of ATM in Immunoglobulin Gene Diversification and Genome Stability. Two proposed pilot projects include: 1) Raman spectroscopy with heavy water labeling and multiphoton microscopy to allow early detection of breast cancer subtypes, including triple negative cancers and 2) Development of Mechanical Interventions to Enhance Drug Delivery to Bone Tumors. New innovative Partnership components include: 1) development of the Linguistic and Cultural Responsiveness Shared Resource Core; 2) formation of the Engineering Health Disparities working group; and 3) new educational programs including the Scholars for the Future program and the Certificate for Medical Translation and Interpretation. The Partnership specific aims are to: 1) Continue to develop outstanding cancer research programs in health disparities, biomedical engineering, computer science / medical imaging, cancer cell biology, and immunology along the Translational Research Continuum; 2) collaborate with diverse communities to conduct and facilitate trailblazing cancer disparities research, and outreach, education, risk reduction, and navigation activities to define and address cancer disparities, with the goal of improving cancer care in the large, medically underserved local and national communities; 3) continue to develop and expand educational opportunities in a robust translational cancer research environment to attract and retain students interested in cancer research (particularly minority and low income students); these opportunities will be enhanced by educational opportunities and increased mentorship and support; and 4) expand and integrate the personnel, resources, and environment needed for scientific collaboration across institutions and influence institutional policies in support of this objective. Narrative This proposal describes our plans to continue and enhance the City College of New York - Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Partnership for Cancer Research, Education and Community Outreach. The CCNY- MSKCC Partnership is a mutually beneficial, cross-institutional collaboration that has promoted translational research, created an education pipeline for minority and low-income students to advance in cancer research careers, and has established community networks and resources for conducting culturally-responsive community engaged research among diverse, at-risk populations in the New York area.","2/2 CCNY-MSKCC Partnership for Cancer Research, Education and Community Outreach",9848787,U54CA137788,"['Affect ', ' Elderly ', ' senior citizen ', ' older person ', ' older adult ', '

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations.

"MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3)",9767522,U54CA163072,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' medical school students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' oncology trial ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2019,1188569,0.08545320989531527
"MSI Faculty in the Field of Cancer Research The Minority Faculty Scholar in Cancer Research Awards increase the scientific knowledge base of faculty at Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs), and encourage them and their students to pursue careers in cancer research.

"Sexual and Gender Minority Cancer Curricular Advances for Research and Education (SGM Cancer CARE) ABSTRACT A health workforce trained to conduct Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM)-inclusive cancer research is needed to meet the needs of SGM persons seeking comprehensive cancer care, including prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship care. Research on SGM cancer care has described many SGM cancer disparities, and a growing number of studies of SGM individuals have documented increased exposure to cancer-risk factors and certain cancers, as well as poorer cancer outcomes. Yet SGM patients are extremely diverse, presenting with unique and varied care needs. Although the body of research focused on SGM groups continues to grow, gaps persist in the knowledge of specific SGM cancer risk factors and cancer treatment experiences that is critical for developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in oncology care across the cancer care continuum – from prevention to survivorship. As no nationally available resource routinely trains and prepares the oncology and biomedical workforce for SGM cancer research, our short-term goal is to design an up-to-date, competency-based 1.5 day workshop for early career researchers: titled SGM Cancer CARE (Sexual and Gender Minority Cancer: Curricular Advances for Research and Education). Informed by our needs assessment, the curriculum will be designed by a multi-disciplinary and multi- institutional leadership team and advisory committee that has national perspective and experience with SGM populations, and in-depth knowledge and expertise in multiple key areas, including cancer research, clinical care, curriculum development, and health care advocacy. This project has the following specific aims: 1) Refine curriculum topics and learning objectives; 2) Design the curricular modules and materials; and 3) Pilot test and evaluate the curriculum. It will be created for health and research professionals with MD, DO, PhD, or DrPH degrees, targeting individuals in the process of shaping their research agendas and interested in SGM cancer issues. It will be presented in a 1.5 day workshop through five modules: 1) clinical cancer research; 2) behavioral science and interventions; 3) epidemiology and population-level research; 4) community research, vulnerable populations, and responsible conduct of research, and 5) opportunities and challenges across modules (i.e. research strategy, funding opportunities, mentorship, and collaborations). The workshop will be piloted as a pre-conference opportunity for the annual LGBT Health Workforce Conference sponsored by the BNGAP organization. The workshop will provide participants with knowledge and skills to conduct quality and culturally appropriate research to improve SGM care across the cancer care continuum, and will facilitate participant access to a national research community and health care provider network dedicated to shared goals in SGM cancer research. Long-term, the resulting curriculum can be expanded and adapted for integration into existing curricula, stimulating training and education of additional professionals to increase SGM cancer research in order to create health equity for vulnerable SGM populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Better understanding by researchers and oncologists of the unique health needs of Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) individuals could markedly reduce cancer risk and/or improve their experience along the cancer care continuum, from prevention to survivorship. In this project, we will design and evaluate a curriculum to help prepare early career MD/DO and PhD/DrPH researchers with capacity to include SGM persons in their cancer research portfolios. This innovative curriculum will provide participants with an overview of the challenges and informational gaps prevalent in SGM cancer research, provide strategies and resources to address them, and introduce them to a network of researchers with shared interests to serve as role models, mentors, and collaborators, thereby enhancing participants’ abilities to successfully engage in SGM cancer

"1/2 Howard-Georgetown Collaborative Partnership In Cancer Research Overall Abstract The overarching goal of the NCI Collaborative P20 Partnership in Cancer Research is to enhance cancer research capacity at Howard University and increase participation in cancer health disparities research at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (GU). The Partnership goals will be achieved through two primary mechanisms: pilot research projects and cancer research education. The P20 will benefit from the guidance of an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) made up of highly qualified and experienced scientists. The Research Pilot Projects will fund four 2-year collaborative research pilot projects. Each project will include at least one investigator from Howard and one from Georgetown. The investigators will benefit from the HU/GU CTSA and the Shared Resources available at GU. Pilot project 1 will identify candidate genes and genetic pathways associated with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The research will inform possible biological mechanisms underlying the molecular and genetic signatures of perturbed metabolic and mechanistic pathways in NAFLD patients in an African–American population. Results may lead to innovative non-invasive biomarkers. Research Project 2 will investigate disparities in chronic stress, quality of life, and physical activity among Black and White breast cancer survivors. This study will provide insight into whether an association exists between physical activity and allostatic load in breast cancer survivors. During the course of the award, the P20 Partnership will elicit two additional pilot studies through a competitive process which will be driven by a merit review by the IAC. The expected outcome of the pilot projects is the submission of successful collaborative grant applications supported by the preliminary data obtained via the pilot research. The C-REP will contribute to the goals of the Partnership by engaging a diverse group students and faculty who are under-represented as investigators in biomedical research. A cohort consisting of a mix of college students in their junior or senior year, graduate and professional students will be recruited annually for an intensive 8-week mentored summer research experience. Follow-up mentoring will be provided to promote entry into a graduate or professional program or postdoctoral research training. Postdoctoral fellows and faculty will receive training and mentoring to support attaining a robust, high quality publication record and submission of highly competitive independent research proposals. Mentoring within the C-REP will occur via teams of at least one faculty member from both institutions. The Howard-Georgetown P20 Partnership brings many strengths including a large pool of under- represented students and faculty at Howard University, extensive research resources through GU, and a foundation of longstanding, productive partnerships between the two institutions. Overall Project Narrative This project is a collaboration between Howard University, a Historically Black University and Georgetown University, a Comprehensive Cancer Center. This partnership will support cancer research studies to provide information that will be useful to advance cancer knowledge and continued research in cancer disparities related fields.

"UPR/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (1 of 2) OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This competitive renewal of the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (Partnership) between the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) will: 1) solidify, strengthen, and expand the relationship between UPR and MDACC; and 2) leverage the breadth and strengths of an experienced and integrated Partnership in transition of the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) towards a long-term overall goal: recognition of UPRCCC as an NCI-designated cancer center. To address some of the most profound cancer health disparities in Puerto Rico and Texas, the Partnership will establish an Infection-Driven Malignancies Program for Advancing Careers and Translational Sciences (IMPACT). This application represents a partnership in which both institutions profit from sharing distinct expertise to mutually benefit in implementation of integrated team science, outreach, education and career development initiatives. To facilitate UPRCCC's transition towards NCI-designation, the UPR PIs led the development of the specific aims with support of the MDACC PIs. The Specific Aims for the renewal are: 1) Develop a multidisciplinary research portfolio focused on health disparities derived from infection-driven malignancies; 2) Increase the number of Hispanic students pursuing careers in laboratory and population- based cancer research to produce a critical mass of clinicians, scientists, and physician-scientists, who specialize in cancer research, with emphasis on cancer health disparities in underrepresented minorities and underserved communities; 3) Strengthen sustainable collaborations among all the stakeholders to develop and promote key community outreach, education, and interventions aimed at reducing cancer rates and emphasizing vaccinations against malignancy linked infections, among Hispanic/Latino populations in PR, TX, and elsewhere; 4) Leverage strategic collaborations with NCI-designated cancer centers to augment the cancer research capacity of the UPR and the UPRCCC; and 5) Provide professional support and development tools through the a) Administration; b) Planning and Evaluation; and c) Shared Resources Cores designed to nurture and optimize the Partnership's research, education, and outreach agendas in support of the long-term goal of an NCI-designated Cancer Center. Key elements of this application to advance the Partnership include: 1) Multidisciplinary collaborative research projects focused on IMPACT that represent stages of the translational research continuum; 2) A comprehensive cancer-focused training and career development core; 3) The development of a dual MD/MPH degree to address specific cancers disproportionately affecting Hispanic populations; 4) Outreach efforts to build, educate, and advocate for broad HPV vaccination programs; and 5) a DATAOmics Core that builds infrastructure. This initiative will strengthen the overall cancer research enterprise in infection-driven malignancies in both PR and TX, and will support the implementation of UPRCCC's roadmap to submission of a Cancer Center Support Grant (P30) for NCI designation. NARRATIVE STATEMENT Hispanics have an increased risk of infection-driven malignancies, including gastric cancer and HIV- and HPV- related malignancies. To address the increased risk factors and burden of infection-driven cancers that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Education, and Outreach. Partnership contributions, including the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers, will help build a stronger national cancer research and prevention program.",UPR/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (1 of 2),9848145,U54CA096300,"['Affect ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Elements ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Government ', ' Grant ', ' Virus-HIV ', ' Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus ', ' LAV-HTLV-III ', ' Human Immunodeficiency Viruses ', ' Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Virus ', ' AIDS Virus ', ' HIV ', ' Cancer Hospital ', ' Infection ', ' Joints ', ' Laboratories ', ' Laws ', ' stomach pylorus cancer ', ' stomach fundus cancer ', ' malignant stomach tumor ', ' Stomach Cancer ', ' Malignant Gastric Tumor ', ' Malignant Gastric Neoplasm ', ' Gastric Pylorus Cancer ', ' Gastric Fundus Cancer ', ' Gastric Cardia Cancer ', ' Gastric Cancer ', ' Gastric Body Cancer ', ' malignant stomach neoplasm ', ' Medicine ', ' Mission ', ' Names ', ' Physicians ', ' Puerto Rico ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Risk Factors ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' survivorship ', ' Texas ', ' Universities ', ' Vaccination ', ' visual function ', ' Sight ', ' Vision ', ' Work ', ' P30 Protein ', ' P30 ', ' P-30 Protein ', ' ranpirnase ', ' hispanic community ', ' Spanish Origin ', ' Latino Population ', ' Hispanic Populations ', ' Hispanics ', ' Outcome Measure ', ' career ', ' Link ', ' Ensure ', ' Evaluation ', ' Training ', ' Interdisciplinary Study ', ' Multidisciplinary Research ', ' Multidisciplinary Collaboration ', ' Interdisciplinary Research ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Educational Intervention ', ' instructional intervention ', ' Training Intervention ', ' Instruction Intervention ', ' Education for Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Early Diagnosis ', ' early detection ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' synergism ', ' Prevention program ', ' outreach ', ' Prevention ', ' career development ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Human papillomavirus-Related Malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-related cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated malignancy ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-associated cancer ', ' Human Papilloma Virus-Related Malignancy ', ' HPV-related cancer ', ' HPV-associated malignancy ', ' HPV-associated cancer ', ' HPV-Related Malignancy ', ' Address ', ' Advocate ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Program ', ' Resource Sharing ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Center Support Grant ', ' CCSG ', ' Comprehensive Cancer Center ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' University of Texas M D Anderson Cancer Center ', ' University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ', ' MDACC ', ' socioeconomics ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socio-economically ', ' socio-economic ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Translational Research Working Group ', ' tool development ', ' population based ', ' health equity ', ' Human Papilloma Virus Vaccination ', ' Human Papillomavirus Vaccination ', ' HPV Vaccination ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disadvantaged population ', ' Infrastructure ', ' infection risk ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,U54,2019,1068163,0.10924237009844297
"The UPMC Hillman Cancer Center Academy PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Over the past nine years, the Hillman Cancer Center (HCC) at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) has trained and mentored 134 high school students from underrepresented minority (URM) groups and economically disadvantaged (DA) backgrounds hailing from over 60 high schools. Our newly proposed Hillman Academy will expand the successes of our current program, which is funded under the expiring Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences to the HCC and was recognized in 2014 with the Carnegie Science Center Leadership in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Education Award. Our past participants performed research over a wide range of cancer topics at six research sites across the campus under the tutelage of 106 faculty members who supported our students as hosts and mentors. Our alumni have won numerous scholarships and awards, coauthored manuscripts, presented at national scientific conferences, and continued research both with us and at the top institutions that they now attend. Ninety-three percent of our alumni with known and declared undergraduate majors matriculated into science- and healthcare-related areas of study. We aim to continue these successes with an expanded program to reach even more URM/DA students—24 per year—to increase the diversity and preparedness of the cancer workforce through a multi-modal approach that includes immersive research experiences, didactic training with tailored curricula, and professional and academic development. We will also lead a number of outreach activities in our region to raise awareness of cancer, cancer disparities, and cancer research through our collaborations with long-standing community partners, such as the Fund for the Advancement of Minorities through Education, MPowerhouse, Inc., and the Homeless Children’s Education Fund. These efforts will grow out of the Hillman Academy to engage URM/DA students at earlier stages, as well as, their schools and other community members. Together, the Hillman Academy will engage, train, and provide paths for URM/DA youth to advance cancer research and care. Our leadership, infrastructure, mentors, and experience of running a holistic research training program position us for lasting success in this endeavor. We will build on our previous accomplishments of promoting the pursuit of STEM education and careers for our students and continue to address cancer disparities by equipping URM/DA youth to be agents of change that impact their communities. NARRATIVE The Hillman Academy at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center will train 24 underrepresented minority and disadvantaged youth per year from Pittsburgh and surrounding areas by providing authentic cancer research experiences, didactic training from a tailored curriculum, and professional and academic development to prepare them for careers in cancer research and care. The Academy will also impact our local communities through outreach events facilitated by our long-standing community partners. The Hillman Academy will build from the strengths of our institution and past successes in working with emerging scientists from underserved backgrounds to broaden participation and expand diversity in the cancer workforce, which will produce more effective research and help decrease health disparities in cancer.",The UPMC Hillman Cancer Center Academy,9701756,R25CA236620,"['Academy ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Communities ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Complement ', ' lesson plans ', ' Curriculum ', ' Educational Curriculum ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Immersion ', ' Immersion Investigative Technique ', ' intern ', ' Internships ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' Pb element ', ' Lead ', ' Leadership ', ' literacy ', ' Mentors ', ' Minority Groups ', ' Research ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Running ', ' Scholarship ', ' Schools ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Translating ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' health care ', ' Healthcare ', ' Youth 10-21 ', ' Youth ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Site ', ' Area ', ' Training ', ' Discipline ', ' Educational workshop ', ' Workshop ', ' Homeless Youth ', ' Homeless Children ', ' Funding ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Event ', ' System ', ' college ', ' collegiate ', ' Medical center ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' Manuscripts ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' Participant ', ' member ', ' Economically Deprived Population ', ' underclass ', ' economically disadvantaged ', ' economic disadvantage ', ' Economically Deprived ', ' outreach ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Position ', ' Advanced Malignant Neoplasm ', ' Advanced Cancer ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer care ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Preparedness ', ' Readiness ', ' Address ', ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' Minority ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' volunteer ', ' stem ', ' multimodality ', ' multi-modality ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics knowledge ', ' science, technology, engineering and math knowledge ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education ', ' STEM knowledge ', ' STEM Education ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' Learning Module ', ' Teaching Module ', ' Educational Module ', ' Education Module ', ' High School Student ', ' Secondary Student ', ' Secondary School Student ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' URM student ', ' Academic support ', ' peer coaching ', ' peer teaching ', ' peer mentoring ', ' peer led team learning ', ' peer instruction ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' recruit ', ' Infrastructure ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,R25,2019,532875,0.057056182973051026
"Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) requests renewal of support for the project “Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer.” The funds will provide Minority Scholar in Cancer Research Awards to support the attendance of young scientists from NIH- recognized minority populations at high-caliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multi-level program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of underrepresentation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. The AACR is grateful for the National Cancer Institute (NCI)’s 30 years of support of minorities in cancer research, and anticipates continuing the success of this program in 2016-2021. The Minority Scholar in Cancer Research Awards expose early-career minority scientists to the best and most current cancer science and medicine through their participation in AACR Annual Meetings and Special Conferences. In addition to exposure to cutting-edge cancer research, scholar awardees also gain access to mentoring and networking contacts with experienced investigators, career-building showcases for their achievements, and professional advancement advice. These awards are given annually to minority undergraduate students, graduate students, medical students, residents, and clinical and postdoctoral fellows to support their participation at the meeting or conference. These awards have been generously supported through this R13 funding mechanism from 1985-2015, and through bridge funding during the most recent program year, 2015-2016, while a professional evaluation of the program was finalized. With this application, AACR is proud to share the results of this evaluation, conducted by Thomson Reuters (Scientific) LLC. Career gains for Minority Scholar awardees were demonstrated to be greater than those of unsuccessful applicants on at least two measures: publications and career promotions. Analysis confirmed the significant and durable benefits for scholar awardees that have also been attested to by scholar awardee narratives throughout the years. 1 This project is a critical initiative by the AACR to address the issue of minority underrepresentation in cancer research, operating to encourage more minority scientists to contribute to and persevere in the field of cancer research. Minority cancer researchers have many unique roles to play in cancer research, including mentoring future minority students, and adding diverse voices to this field of study to produce innovation. But perhaps the most important is to improve outcomes for minority patients. Minority research scientists could be more successful in balancing the diversity of clinical trial subjects and more successful in inspiring the trust of subjects. Dedicated minority researchers also have the potential to succeed with behavioral interventions that require outreach to minority communities, due to sensitivity to cultures and even the locations of targeted populations. 1",Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer,9766815,R13CA040577,"['American Association of Cancer Research ', ' AACR ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovation ', ' innovative ', ' innovate ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' improved outcome ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority scientist ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' minority student ', ' minority communities ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Authorship ', ' Award ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' behavior intervention ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' balance function ', ' balance ', ' Equilibrium ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' social role ', ' Role ', ' Science ', ' medical school students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' symposia ', ' summit ', ' convention ', ' conference ', ' symposium ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' post-doctoral ', ' post-doc ', ' Research Associate ', ' Postdoc ', ' Training and Education ', ' Education and Training ', ' experience ', ' field study ', ' field test ', ' field learning ', ' field based data ', ' success ', ' knowledge base ', ' knowledgebase ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' Institution ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' NCI Organization ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2019,69443,0.13871979820142283
"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (1 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (1 of 3)",9765041,U54CA163069,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Biometrics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' malignancy ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' Cancers ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Education ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' ontogeny ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Growth ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Publications ', ' Research ', ' R&D ', ' R & D ', ' Development and Research ', ' research and development ', ' Researchers ', ' Investigators ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Research Resources ', ' Resources ', ' school of medicine ', ' medical college ', ' medical schools ', ' medical school students ', ' Medical Students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' black American ', ' Black Populations ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Afro American ', ' African American ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' advisory team ', ' Task Forces ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Grants ', ' R01 Program ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Science ', ' Basic Research ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Translational Research ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Science ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' Development ', ' developmental ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' pathway ', ' anticancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' design ', ' designing ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' minority institution ', ' undergraduate student ', ' undergraduate ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' disparity reduction ', ' reduce disparity ', ' healthcare community ', ' health care community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' oncology trial ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U54,2019,1260751,0.08545320989531527

"MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC, & TSU: PARTNERS IN ELIMINATING CANCER DISPARITIES (2 of 3)",10003142,U54CA163072,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' minority institution ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' oncology trial ', ' ']",NCI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,U54,2020,1511127,0.08545320989531527
"Mentoring Translational Cancer Research in Oklahoma Abstract – Overall Component The overall objectives of the proposal are to improve the quality and quantity of cancer research and increase NIH funding at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center (OUHSC), Oklahoma through the mentoring of promising junior Target investigators (Target investigators) and to develop support for the infrastructure for cancer research. Building on the success of the Phase I of this COBRE, the Phase II COBRE grant will support and sustain the infrastructure developed during the previous Phase I funding period in addition to mentoring a new cadre of target junior investigators. This COBRE will continue the process of strengthening cancer research in Oklahoma and enhance the research base, infrastructure, and core capacities of the Cancer Center. The focused and structured mentoring process of this COBRE will have a determinative influence helping TJIs achieve independent national funding. Finally, as has been observed with the Phase I of this COBRE, the Phase II grant will accelerate the development of the Cancer Center as it progresses towards submitting a competitive NCI Cancer Center Support Grant application. The overarching objective of the COBRE in enhancing the cancer research capacity of Oklahoma will be accomplished through the following specific aims: 1) To sustain the successful mentoring of promising junior target junior investigators in cancer research, enabling them to become independent NIH-funded investigators; 2) To support and strengthen the research infrastructure established during the Phase I of this COBRE; and 3) To foster and enhance multidisciplinary collaborative research to facilitate translational research.

"UPR/MDACC: Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (2 of 2) OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This competitive renewal of the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (Partnership) between the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) will: 1) solidify, strengthen, and expand the relationship between UPR and MDACC; and 2) leverage the breadth and strengths of an experienced and integrated Partnership in transition of the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) towards a long-term overall goal: recognition of UPRCCC as an NCI-designated cancer center. To address some of the most profound cancer health disparities in Puerto Rico and Texas, the Partnership will establish an Infection-Driven Malignancies Program for Advancing Careers and Translational Sciences (IMPACT). This application represents a partnership in which both institutions profit from sharing distinct expertise to mutually benefit in implementation of integrated team science, outreach, education and career development initiatives. To facilitate UPRCCC’s transition towards NCI-designation, the UPR PIs led the development of the specific aims with support of the MDACC PIs. The Specific Aims for the renewal are: 1) Develop a multidisciplinary research portfolio focused on health disparities derived from infection-driven malignancies; 2) Increase the number of Hispanic students pursuing careers in laboratory and population- based cancer research to produce a critical mass of clinicians, scientists, and physician-scientists, who specialize in cancer research, with emphasis on cancer health disparities in underrepresented minorities and underserved communities; 3) Strengthen sustainable collaborations among all the stakeholders to develop and promote key community outreach, education, and interventions aimed at reducing cancer rates and emphasizing vaccinations against malignancy linked infections, among Hispanic/Latino populations in PR, TX, and elsewhere; 4) Leverage strategic collaborations with NCI-designated cancer centers to augment the cancer research capacity of the UPR and the UPRCCC; and 5) Provide professional support and development tools through the a) Administration; b) Planning and Evaluation; and c) Shared Resources Cores designed to nurture and optimize the Partnership’s research, education, and outreach agendas in support of the long-term goal of an NCI-designated Cancer Center. Key elements of this application to advance the Partnership include: 1) Multidisciplinary collaborative research projects focused on IMPACT that represent stages of the translational research continuum; 2) A comprehensive cancer-focused training and career development core; 3) The development of a dual MD/MPH degree to address specific cancers disproportionately affecting Hispanic populations; 4) Outreach efforts to build, educate, and advocate for broad HPV vaccination programs; and 5) a DATAOmics Core that builds infrastructure. This initiative will strengthen the overall cancer research enterprise in infection-driven malignancies in both PR and TX, and will support the implementation of UPRCCC’s roadmap to submission of a Cancer Center Support Grant (P30) for NCI designation. NARRATIVE STATEMENT Hispanics have an increased risk of infection-driven malignancies, including gastric cancer and HIV- and HPV- related malignancies. To address the increased risk factors and burden of infection-driven cancers that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Education, and Outreach.

"2/2 Langston University-UNTHSC Partnership for Cancer Research and Education Project Summary (Overall) With the current US population continuing to grow at its current pace, nearly 50% of the US population in 2050 will be from medically underserved, vulnerable populations. Substantial evidence exists for the underrepresentation of minorities (individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds) in all levels of the biomedical workforce (from the undergraduate level to the professoriate). Racial/ethnic populations demonstrate increased incidence and/or more aggressive disease for specific cancer types. Even when accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors, incidence and mortality differences persist between racial/ethnic populations for some cancer types. Recent studies indicate that these unequal cancer burdens may be due to a complex biology that needs to be investigated to increase our basic understanding of cancer health disparities. There is a lack of diversity in the professional fields of healthcare and research, which strive to treat and eliminate the health disparities that exist in cancer prevalent throughout the United States. This proposal will focus on promoting diversity in individuals engaged cancer research and cancer disparities by developing a partnership between the Institute for Cancer Research at University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) and Langston University (LU), the only historically black college in Oklahoma. The Objective of the proposed partnership is to promote cancer-related research, cancer research experience and cancer education to undergraduate students and junior faculty. Each of the activities will be jointly developed and implemented at LU and UNTHSC. We will meet our objectives through three Specific Aims: Aim 1) Establish an Administrative Core (AC) that will be responsible for the overall implementation, management, and evaluation of the success of the various components of the partnership, Aim 2) Promote interdisciplinary and collaborative cancer research involving faculty from UNTHSC and LU, and support two pilot research projects, and Aim 3) Develop a Cancer Research Education Program (CREP) that provides students and junior faculty with cancer education, cancer research experiences, experimental design, interprofessional education (IPE) and health disparities. Our expectation is that by meeting our objectives, we will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of establishing a long- term partnership between LU and UNTHSC with an ultimate outcome of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cancer. Innovative features of proposed partnership program are (1) focus on the development of research excellence and professionalism in cancer and health disparities among the underrepresented and disadvantageous scholars; (2) extended active coaching integrated with interprofessional training programs and academic training, and (3) developing interdisciplinary cancer research teams. These activities will have a significant impact on increasing the success of URM and other disadvantaged groups in health disparity research related to cancer. Project Narrative There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) Plan and implement a collaborative partnership between Langston University and UNT Health Science Center. 2) Support two collaborative pilot cancer research projects and 3) Provide cancer education, cancer research training and professional development to underrepresented minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds and disabilities who will pursue cancer disparity research.",2/2 Langston University-UNTHSC Partnership for Cancer Research and Education,10005200,P20CA233355,"['Academic Training ', ' Accounting ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mortality ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' cancer education ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' URM student ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' minority student ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF NORTH TEXAS HLTH SCI CTR,P20,2020,360093,0.1606877786892366
"1/2 Howard-Georgetown Collaborative Partnership In Cancer Research Overall Abstract The overarching goal of the NCI Collaborative P20 Partnership in Cancer Research is to enhance cancer research capacity at Howard University and increase participation in cancer health disparities research at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (GU). The Partnership goals will be achieved through two primary mechanisms: pilot research projects and cancer research education. The P20 will benefit from the guidance of an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) made up of highly qualified and experienced scientists. The Research Pilot Projects will fund four 2-year collaborative research pilot projects. Each project will include at least one investigator from Howard and one from Georgetown. The investigators will benefit from the HU/GU CTSA and the Shared Resources available at GU. Pilot project 1 will identify candidate genes and genetic pathways associated with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The research will inform possible biological mechanisms underlying the molecular and genetic signatures of perturbed metabolic and mechanistic pathways in NAFLD patients in an African–American population. Results may lead to innovative non-invasive biomarkers. Research Project 2 will investigate disparities in chronic stress, quality of life, and physical activity among Black and White breast cancer survivors. This study will provide insight into whether an association exists between physical activity and allostatic load in breast cancer survivors. During the course of the award, the P20 Partnership will elicit two additional pilot studies through a competitive process which will be driven by a merit review by the IAC. The expected outcome of the pilot projects is the submission of successful collaborative grant applications supported by the preliminary data obtained via the pilot research. The C-REP will contribute to the goals of the Partnership by engaging a diverse group students and faculty who are under-represented as investigators in biomedical research. A cohort consisting of a mix of college students in their junior or senior year, graduate and professional students will be recruited annually for an intensive 8-week mentored summer research experience. Follow-up mentoring will be provided to promote entry into a graduate or professional program or postdoctoral research training. Postdoctoral fellows and faculty will receive training and mentoring to support attaining a robust, high quality publication record and submission of highly competitive independent research proposals. Mentoring within the C-REP will occur via teams of at least one faculty member from both institutions. The Howard-Georgetown P20 Partnership brings many strengths including a large pool of under- represented students and faculty at Howard University, extensive research resources through GU, and a foundation of longstanding, productive partnerships between the two institutions. Overall Project Narrative This project is a collaboration between Howard University, a Historically Black University and Georgetown University, a Comprehensive Cancer Center. This partnership will support cancer research studies to provide information that will be useful to advance cancer knowledge and continued research in cancer disparities related fields. Through mentoring, education, and research experiences, we intend to increase participation in cancer research from individuals who are under-represented in the research field.",1/2 Howard-Georgetown Collaborative Partnership In Cancer Research,10013145,P20CA242617,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.

"Sexual and Gender Minority Cancer Curricular Advances for Research and Education (SGM Cancer CARE) ABSTRACT A health workforce trained to conduct Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM)-inclusive cancer research is needed to meet the needs of SGM persons seeking comprehensive cancer care, including prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship care. Research on SGM cancer care has described many SGM cancer disparities, and a growing number of studies of SGM individuals have documented increased exposure to cancer-risk factors and certain cancers, as well as poorer cancer outcomes. Yet SGM patients are extremely diverse, presenting with unique and varied care needs. Although the body of research focused on SGM groups continues to grow, gaps persist in the knowledge of specific SGM cancer risk factors and cancer treatment experiences that is critical for developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines in oncology care across the cancer care continuum – from prevention to survivorship. As no nationally available resource routinely trains and prepares the oncology and biomedical workforce for SGM cancer research, our short-term goal is to design an up-to-date, competency-based 1.5 day workshop for early career researchers: titled SGM Cancer CARE (Sexual and Gender Minority Cancer: Curricular Advances for Research and Education). Informed by our needs assessment, the curriculum will be designed by a multi-disciplinary and multi- institutional leadership team and advisory committee that has national perspective and experience with SGM populations, and in-depth knowledge and expertise in multiple key areas, including cancer research, clinical care, curriculum development, and health care advocacy. This project has the following specific aims: 1) Refine curriculum topics and learning objectives; 2) Design the curricular modules and materials; and 3) Pilot test and evaluate the curriculum. It will be created for health and research professionals with MD, DO, PhD, or DrPH degrees, targeting individuals in the process of shaping their research agendas and interested in SGM cancer issues. It will be presented in a 1.5 day workshop through five modules: 1) clinical cancer research; 2) behavioral science and interventions; 3) epidemiology and population-level research; 4) community research, vulnerable populations, and responsible conduct of research, and 5) opportunities and challenges across modules (i.e. research strategy, funding opportunities, mentorship, and collaborations). The workshop will be piloted as a pre-conference opportunity for the annual LGBT Health Workforce Conference sponsored by the BNGAP organization. The workshop will provide participants with knowledge and skills to conduct quality and culturally appropriate research to improve SGM care across the cancer care continuum, and will facilitate participant access to a national research community and health care provider network dedicated to shared goals in SGM cancer research. Long-term, the resulting curriculum can be expanded and adapted for integration into existing curricula, stimulating training and education of additional professionals to increase SGM cancer research in order to create health equity for vulnerable SGM populations. PROJECT NARRATIVE Better understanding by researchers and oncologists of the unique health needs of Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) individuals could markedly reduce cancer risk and/or improve their experience along the cancer care continuum, from prevention to survivorship. In this project, we will design and evaluate a curriculum to help prepare early career MD/DO and PhD/DrPH researchers with capacity to include SGM persons in their cancer research portfolios. This innovative curriculum will provide participants with an overview of the challenges and informational gaps prevalent in SGM cancer research, provide strategies and resources to address them, and introduce them to a network of researchers with shared interests to serve as role models, mentors, and collaborators, thereby enhancing participants’ abilities to successfully engage in SGM cancer

"Rutgers Youth Enjoy Science (RUYES) program Project Summary. In New Jersey, there are significant cancer disparities across population groups that are also underrepresented in the cancer research and healthcare workforce. To reduce cancer inequities there is a need to train youth from disparate population groups to pursue cancer research and healthcare careers. The goal of this program at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey (RCINJ) is to increase the diversity of the biomedical, specifically cancer research workforce. To achieve this goal, we will: 1) provide mentored cancer research experience and curriculum development support to high school teachers working with students from underrepresented backgrounds; 2) engage high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds in mentored hands-on cancer research, co-curricular and professional career development activities; and 3) develop innovative cancer related outreach activities that connect program participants with schools and families in their communities. Cohorts of science teachers will engage in mentored cancer research for eight weeks each for two consecutive summers (sixteen weeks total). Experts in curriculum development will support teachers in developing novel instructional approaches that are related to their research experience. Cohorts of students will have the opportunity to conduct mentored cancer research for ten weeks each for two consecutive summers (twenty weeks total). Students will receive co-curricular and professional development support throughout their research experience. Participants will engage in research and program related activities for 3 months per year for two years. We will recruit program participants from all over New Jersey with special emphasis on school districts with high percentages of students from underrepresented backgrounds. Faculty members with active, well-funded research programs and extensive mentoring experience will support participants. Experienced leadership team with track-record of developing, implementing and evaluating pipeline programs for students from underrepresented backgrounds, will ensure successful implementation of the program. Both formative and summative evaluation by an external evaluator will be integral parts of the proposed program. We will annually track the educational and professional activities of trainees for at least 15 years after completing research training. We will disseminate results from the comprehensive evaluation on the program web site. Additional dissemination will occur through articles published in peer-reviewed journals and through presentations at regional and national conferences, by program staff as well as participants. Our program will leverage the multi-disciplinary research environment, robust educational and outreach resources of RCINJ, the state’s only NCI designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. Synergistic collaborations with similar initiatives across Rutgers will ensure that the program succeeds in training the next generation of a diverse cancer research and healthcare workforce.

"Minnesota Cancer Research And Teaching Excellence: M-CREATE The innovative University of Minnesota Cancer Research And Teaching Excellence: M-CREATE program leverages ten years of high school and undergraduate health equity cancer research-focused mentorship and education activities, to implement a theoretically guided, evidence driven program designed to grow the numbers of cancer-focused scientists from groups underrepresented in science, and promote their academic developmental progress towards future careers in cancer research. M-CREATE will combine the experiences of our unique team including Masonic Cancer Center and Program in Health Disparities Research leadership, with best practices from education, mentorship, service learning, and parent education within a theoretical and equity-oriented frame to engage, educate, and support students to achieve the knowledge, skills, science identity, and self-efficacy required to support academic persistence and long-term success within the biomedical and behavioral sciences. The long-term goal of this proposal is to address the pressing needs of our increasingly diverse patient population in Minnesota and the United States (U.S.) by enhancing the diversity of the cancer-focused research workforce. We will support the academic persistence of first, 240 early high school students attending two urban school districts comprised of approximately seventy percent Native American students and students of color, through a multicomponent, staged program combining hands on research mentorship, academic and professional development, science-oriented identity development, parent support, and community-engaged service learning. Four cohorts of 60 students will participate in an initial engagement year comprised of supportive and exciting hands-on experiences. Ten students per cohort will continue in an intensive experience including two nine-week summer mentored research experiences and a community-engaged service learning experience. Next, 60 early-stage undergraduate students underrepresented in science will participate in a nine-week summer program combining academic and professional development and hands on research mentorship. Finally, we will deepen the science-focused skills of high school teachers from collaborating districts serving students underrepresented in science through a hands-on research lab experience paired with evidence-based support to develop curricula responsive to the needs of diverse learners. Diversifying the cancer research workforce is critical to addressing the pressing needs of increasingly diverse patient populations in Minnesota and across the U.S. M-CREATE aligns strongly with NCI strategic priorities to strengthen the cancer research workforce and mitigate cancer disparities.

"UPWARDS Training Program (Underrepresented Minorities Working Towards Research Diversity in Science) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As a recognized leader in cancer research,1 MD Anderson Cancer Center is well poised to address a significant lack of diversity in the cancer research workforce that contributes to considerable disparities.2-6 We will do so via early intervention programs that foster sustained interest in cancer research in students underrepresented and minority in Science (URMS). Since 2011, we have directed a summer undergraduate training program encompassing 345 trainees (from 2011-2018), including 120 URMS. Significantly, outcomes for URMS and non-minority trainees in our program are indistinguishable; URMS and non-minority alumni are enrolled in or have completed STEM bachelor’s (98.8% vs 98.1%) and doctoral (both 67.1%) degrees and are retained in STEM education or workforce (98.3% vs 98.6%, respectively). Built upon these successes, we have designed a comprehensive cancer research training program for high school and undergraduate URMS via the R25 YES initiative. In our URMS-focused program, we address major barriers in URMS pursuit and success in STEM, including: limited 1) research experience, 2) career path knowledge, and 3) scientific identity formation and exposure to science; 4) underdeveloped professionalism and communication skills; 5) inadequate research, educational, and career mentoring; and 6) barriers in the graduate application process. Our proposed UPWARDS Training Program (Underrepresented Minorities Working Towards Research Diversity in Science) has 3 tracks: full-time, 12-week summer research for 1) high-schoolers and 2) undergraduates and 3) part-time, 40-week research for undergraduates. Within each track, we propose the following aims to address the aforementioned barriers: Aim 1) Employ focused URMS recruitment and holistic strategies for program inclusion, and deliver didactic learning and hands-on cancer research experiences through a cadre of outstanding mentoring faculty. Aim 2) Develop and deliver individualized mentoring, career exploration, and professional development that stimulates graduate education and cancer research career pursuit. Aim 3) Educate and inspire URMS communities, young generations in the STEM pipeline, and the families and support systems of our students through training, STEM outreach, and hands-on engagement. We will encourage our trainees to lead and encourage their communities and younger generations through hands-on STEM outreach activities and design and delivery of community education. Aim 4) Implement and maintain a rigorous assessment program with continual appraisal and enactment of novel, evidence-driven best practices derived from these efforts. Lastly, we commit to disseminating our findings and best practices via peer-reviewed publications. Through the UPWARDS Program, we will build upon our prior experiences and best practices to launch a cancer research training program specifically designed to fit the needs of URMS trainees in our local community and nationally. We anticipate our efforts will effectively increase diversity in the STEM educational pipeline and cancer research workforce. UPWARDS Training Program Public Health Relevance Statement/Project Narrative As a recognized leader in cancer research, MD Anderson Cancer Center is well poised to address the critical lack of diversity plaguing the cancer research workforce and educational pipeline via early intervention programs that foster sustained interest in cancer research for young scientists. Our comprehensive UPWARDS Training Program (Underrepresented Minorities Working Towards Research Diversity in Science) addresses major barriers deterring and preventing many minority students from pursuing and succeeding in graduate programs and in cancer research careers. The UPWARDS Training Program will cultivate high school and undergraduate minority scientists with the goal of increasing diversity in biomedical graduate programs and in the cancer research workforce through 1) minority-focused recruitment, 2) hands-on cancer research experiences, 3) a strong mentoring and career/professional development, 4) education and engagement of minority communities and younger generations in the STEM pipeline through outreach and community education activities, and 5) a rigorous assessment plan with dissemination of best practices.",UPWARDS Training Program (Underrepresented Minorities Working Towards Research Diversity in Science),10023785,R25CA240137,"['Bioethics ', ' Biomedical Ethics ', ' Career Choice ', ' Career Path ', ' career aspiration ', ' career interest ', ' career pathway ', ' career track ', ' Communication ', ' Communities ', ' Community Health Education ', ' Community Education ', ' Complement ', ' Complement Proteins ', ' Economics ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Graduate Education ', ' Faculty ', ' Feedback ', ' Goals ', ' Laboratory Research ', ' Lead ', ' Pb element ', ' heavy metal Pb ', ' heavy metal lead ', ' Learning ', ' Mentors ', ' Mission ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Students ', ' Time ', ' Training Programs ', ' Generations ', ' base ', ' career ', ' Training ', ' pediatric ', ' Childhood ', ' Individual ', ' Fostering ', ' Development Plans ', ' Early Intervention ', ' cancer prevention ', ' Community Outreach ', ' Exposure to ', ' Knowledge ', ' posters ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Oral ', ' interest ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' high school ', ' intervention program ', ' skills ', ' novel ', ' outreach ', ' Position ', ' Positioning Attribute ', ' Social Support System ', ' Support System ', ' Admission ', ' Admission activity ', ' career development ', ' cancer care ', ' preventing ', ' prevent ', ' Address ', ' Baccalaureate Degree ', ' Undergraduate Degree ', "" Bachelor's Degree "", ' Data ', ' Doctorate Degree ', ' doctoral degree ', "" Doctor's Degree "", ' Research Training ', ' Cancer Biology ', ' Cancer Center ', ' enroll ', ' Enrollment ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Process ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Prevention education ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' skill development ', ' skill acquisition ', ' public health relevance ', ' responsible research conduct ', ' STEM workforce ', ' science, technology, engineering and math career ', ' science, technology, engineering and math workforce ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics career ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics workforce ', ' STEM career ', ' STEM Education ', ' STEM knowledge ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Education ', ' science, technology, engineering and math knowledge ', ' science, technology, engineering and mathematics knowledge ', ' Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Education ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' Underrepresented Students ', ' career knowledge ', ' career awareness ', ' student training ', ' faculty mentor ', ' summer research ', ' hands on research ', ' education research ', ' high school program ', ' Career Exploration ', ' family support ', ' minority scientist ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' minority student ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' minority communities ', ' recruit ', ' Immersion ', ' ']",NCI,UNIVERSITY OF TX MD ANDERSON CAN CTR,R25,2020,419555,0.07857419538580807

Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University (NU-LCC). ChicagoCHEC combines the attributes of these three exceptional institutions, each with robust capacity to interact with their urban-shared setting. Launched in 2015, ChicagoCHEC is dedicated to advancing cancer health equity through rigorous and innovative science, education, and outreach and engagement of Chicago’s underserved communities. This is reflected in the following goals: Aim 1. To strengthen a transformational alliance between UIC, NEIU, and the NU-LCC in pursuit of cancer health equity in Chicago; Aim 2. To initiate, conduct, and support innovative bench, translational, clinical, and prevention and control focused cancer research, with emphasis on cancer health disparities; Aim 3. To develop and implement cancer-related education and outreach activities generated with the engagement of underserved communities across Chicago; Aim 4. To coordinate research education and mentoring opportunities to recruit, retain, and advance a pipeline of underrepresented students in cancer research careers and to develop early career faculty who will forge independent cancer research careers; and Aim 5. To conduct ongoing rigorous evaluation of ChicagoCHEC activities. These goals are accomplished by a nurturing hub of four Cores (Administrative, Planning and Evaluation, Research Education, and Outreach) and a research project funding program. Since the launch of ChicagoCHEC in 2015, there has been rapid growth in collaborative infrastructure built across the three partnering institutions; enhanced cancer research engagement, capacity, and education; extensive community outreach and engagement; and encouraging advancement of ChicagoCHEC faculty and students. ChicagoCHEC projects and programs provided research experiences to 155 students, provided cancer research and leadership opportunities for 57 faculty (21 have been promoted/received tenure), and directly resulted in 94 peer-reviewed publications, 47 extramural grants submitted, and 24 grants awarded. ChicagoCHEC will leverage the momentum forged by the initial U54 award to drive innovative cancer research, research education, and community outreach and engagement that cuts across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. ChicagoCHEC will leverage its diverse team of faculty, students, and partners, connectivity to Chicago’s underserved communities, and guidance of internal and external advisory bodies. The next chapter will include two initial full cancer research projects and two initial pilot projects, continued support from four tri-institutional ChicagoCHEC Cores, and strong institutional commitment.

Our newly proposed Hillman Academy will expand the successes of our current program, which is funded under the expiring Continuing Umbrella of Research Experiences to the HCC and was recognized in 2014 with the Carnegie Science Center Leadership in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) Education Award. Our past participants performed research over a wide range of cancer topics at six research sites across the campus under the tutelage of 106 faculty members who supported our students as hosts and mentors. Our alumni have won numerous scholarships and awards, coauthored manuscripts, presented at national scientific conferences, and continued research both with us and at the top institutions that they now attend. Ninety-three percent of our alumni with known and declared undergraduate majors matriculated into science- and healthcare-related areas of study. We aim to continue these successes with an expanded program to reach even more URM/DA students—24 per year—to increase the diversity and preparedness of the cancer workforce through a multi-modal approach that includes immersive research experiences, didactic training with tailored curricula, and professional and academic development. We will also lead a number of outreach activities in our region to raise awareness of cancer, cancer disparities, and cancer research through our collaborations with long-standing community partners, such as the Fund for the Advancement of Minorities through Education, MPowerhouse, Inc., and the Homeless Children’s Education Fund. These efforts will grow out of the Hillman Academy to engage URM/DA students at earlier stages, as well as, their schools and other community members. Together, the Hillman Academy will engage, train, and provide paths for URM/DA youth to advance cancer research and care. Our leadership, infrastructure, mentors, and experience of running a holistic research training program position us for lasting success in this endeavor. We will build on our previous accomplishments of promoting the pursuit of STEM education and careers for our students and continue to address cancer disparities by equipping URM/DA youth to be agents of change that impact their communities. NARRATIVE The Hillman Academy at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center will train 24 underrepresented minority and disadvantaged youth per year from Pittsburgh and surrounding areas by providing authentic cancer research experiences, didactic training from a tailored curriculum, and professional and academic development to prepare them for careers in cancer research and care. The Academy will also impact our local communities through outreach events facilitated by our long-standing community partners.

"2/2 Howard-Georgetown Collaborative Partnership in Cancer Research Overall Abstract The overarching goal of the NCI Collaborative P20 Partnership in Cancer Research is to enhance cancer research capacity at Howard University and increase participation in cancer health disparities research at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (GU). The Partnership goals will be achieved through two primary mechanisms: pilot research projects and cancer research education. The P20 will benefit from the guidance of an Internal Advisory Committee (IAC) made up of highly qualified and experienced scientists. The Research Pilot Projects will fund four 2-year collaborative research pilot projects. Each project will include at least one investigator from Howard and one from Georgetown. The investigators will benefit from the HU/GU CTSA and the Shared Resources available at GU. Pilot project 1 will identify candidate genes and genetic pathways associated with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). The research will inform possible biological mechanisms underlying the molecular and genetic signatures of perturbed metabolic and mechanistic pathways in NAFLD patients in an African–American population. Results may lead to innovative non-invasive biomarkers. Research Project 2 will investigate disparities in chronic stress, quality of life, and physical activity among Black and White breast cancer survivors. This study will provide insight into whether an association exists between physical activity and allostatic load in breast cancer survivors. During the course of the award, the P20 Partnership will elicit two additional pilot studies through a competitive process which will be driven by a merit review by the IAC. The expected outcome of the pilot projects is the submission of successful collaborative grant applications supported by the preliminary data obtained via the pilot research. The C-REP will contribute to the goals of the Partnership by engaging a diverse group students and faculty who are under-represented as investigators in biomedical research. A cohort consisting of a mix of college students in their junior or senior year, graduate and professional students will be recruited annually for an intensive 8-week mentored summer research experience. Follow-up mentoring will be provided to promote entry into a graduate or professional program or postdoctoral research training. Postdoctoral fellows and faculty will receive training and mentoring to support attaining a robust, high quality publication record and submission of highly competitive independent research proposals. Mentoring within the C-REP will occur via teams of at least one faculty member from both institutions. The Howard-Georgetown P20 Partnership brings many strengths including a large pool of under- represented students and faculty at Howard University, extensive research resources through GU, and a foundation of longstanding, productive partnerships between the two institutions. Overall Project Narrative This project is a collaboration between Howard University, a Historically Black University and Georgetown University, a Comprehensive Cancer Center. This partnership will support cancer research studies to provide information that will be useful to advance cancer knowledge and continued research in cancer disparities related fields. Through mentoring, education, and research experiences, we intend to increase participation in cancer research from individuals who are under-represented in the research field.",2/2 Howard-Georgetown Collaborative Partnership in Cancer Research,10004016,P20CA242611,"['Affect ', ' Award ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Communities ', ' District of Columbia ', ' D.C.

"Cancer Research - Scholarship and Training Experience's in Population Sciences"" (C-STEPS) PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT As a nation, we have made tremendous advances in cancer prevention and control. However, these advances have not accrued evenly across society. New directions in population health, genetic screening and precision medicine may hold promise to promote health equity through risk identification and disease preemption, leading to potentially transforming cancer morbidity and mortality. To be at this cutting edge of scientific discovery and translation, we require more, and better prepared, STEM-H (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and health) professionals trained in cancer and health focused careers. The long-term goal of this program is to increase the biomedical and behavioral research workforce by providing specialized and experiential curricula that highlights team-oriented population sciences. In order to contribute to this goal, the overall objective of this initiative is to implement a cancer research education program, “Cancer Research—Scholarship and Training Experiences in Population Sciences” (C-STEPS). This program is designed to facilitate and support undergraduate students in their completion of a degree in a STEM-H field and to facilitate their selection of, and application to, graduate or professional schools, while encouraging their interests in research careers. C-STEPS, a 10-week summer cancer research experiences program, consists of 4 integrated components: 1) inquiry-based research seminars, 2) skills-based, student-tailored, mentored research experiences, 3) development of career plans, and 4) team-building activities. We will recruit cohorts of 10 undergraduates nationally for participation in C-STEPS. We will solicit applications from students intending to pursue graduate or professional education in STEM-H disciplines. Students will participate full-time from mid-May through August, guided by faculty and research mentors with expertise in cancer control and population sciences (i.e., cancer risk prediction and risk reduction, cancer screening, cancer outcomes, and survivorship). C-STEPS builds on existing resources at the University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center. Specific aims are to: 1) Provide foundational understanding, through inquiry-based research seminars, of current and emerging innovations in cancer prevention and control and of collaborative team science through team-building activities. 2) Provide skills-based mentored research experiences. 3) Provide specific opportunities to implement STEM-H career planning in collaboration with and through personalized coaching from faculty, and “peers” (UNM STEM Gateway undergraduates and returning C-STEPS alumni in Years 2-5) and “near-peers” (graduate students, post-doctoral fellows); including preparation of individual development plans, which foster career development. C-STEPS will increase the number of undergraduates pursuing graduate or professional schools, and ultimately research careers thereby addressing a national priority for well-trained STEM-H professionals in cancer and health focused careers. PROJECT NARRATIVE There is an acute need for more, and better prepared, STEM-H (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and health) professionals, especially trained in cancer and health focused careers. We address this national priority through the proposed cancer research education program for undergraduate students that provides: inquiry-based research seminars, innovative mentored cancer research experiences, team-building activities, and career development mentoring.

"Diversity Supplement M. Soto OVERALL PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT This competitive renewal of the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research (Partnership) between the University of Puerto Rico (UPR) and the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) will: 1) solidify, strengthen, and expand the relationship between UPR and MDACC; and 2) leverage the breadth and strengths of an experienced and integrated Partnership in transition of the UPR Comprehensive Cancer Center (UPRCCC) towards a long-term overall goal: recognition of UPRCCC as an NCI-designated cancer center. To address some of the most profound cancer health disparities in Puerto Rico and Texas, the Partnership will establish an Infection-Driven Malignancies Program for Advancing Careers and Translational Sciences (IMPACT). This application represents a partnership in which both institutions profit from sharing distinct expertise to mutually benefit in implementation of integrated team science, outreach, education and career development initiatives. To facilitate UPRCCC’s transition towards NCI-designation, the UPR PIs led the development of the specific aims with support of the MDACC PIs. The Specific Aims for the renewal are: 1) Develop a multidisciplinary research portfolio focused on health disparities derived from infection-driven malignancies; 2) Increase the number of Hispanic students pursuing careers in laboratory and population- based cancer research to produce a critical mass of clinicians, scientists, and physician-scientists, who specialize in cancer research, with emphasis on cancer health disparities in underrepresented minorities and underserved communities; 3) Strengthen sustainable collaborations among all the stakeholders to develop and promote key community outreach, education, and interventions aimed at reducing cancer rates and emphasizing vaccinations against malignancy linked infections, among Hispanic/Latino populations in PR, TX, and elsewhere; 4) Leverage strategic collaborations with NCI-designated cancer centers to augment the cancer research capacity of the UPR and the UPRCCC; and 5) Provide professional support and development tools through the a) Administration; b) Planning and Evaluation; and c) Shared Resources Cores designed to nurture and optimize the Partnership’s research, education, and outreach agendas in support of the long-term goal of an NCI-designated Cancer Center. Key elements of this application to advance the Partnership include: 1) Multidisciplinary collaborative research projects focused on IMPACT that represent stages of the translational research continuum; 2) A comprehensive cancer-focused training and career development core; 3) The development of a dual MD/MPH degree to address specific cancers disproportionately affecting Hispanic populations; 4) Outreach efforts to build, educate, and advocate for broad HPV vaccination programs; and 5) a DATAOmics Core that builds infrastructure. This initiative will strengthen the overall cancer research enterprise in infection-driven malignancies in both PR and TX, and will support the implementation of UPRCCC’s roadmap to submission of a Cancer Center Support Grant (P30) for NCI designation. NARRATIVE STATEMENT Hispanics have an increased risk of infection-driven malignancies, including gastric cancer and HIV- and HPV- related malignancies. To address the increased risk factors and burden of infection-driven cancers that exist among Hispanic populations in the US, the Partnership for Excellence in Cancer Research strives to reduce these disparities through efforts in Cancer Research, Education, and Outreach. Partnership contributions, including the development of a pipeline of well-trained, Hispanic cancer researchers, will help build a stronger national cancer research and prevention program.",Diversity Supplement M.

"Roadmap for America's Cancer Explorers for the 21st Century (Race 21) Roadmap for America’s Cancer Explorers for the 21st Century (RACE21) is an interdisciplinary program to develop a pipeline to a diverse 21st century cancer research workforce. Cancer is a primary cause of adult mortalities in the US, despite excellent advances in understanding cancer biology and innovative treatments. In Alabama, cancer is the 2nd highest cause of mortality, and cancer death rates are almost double in Alabama’s African-American (compared to White) males. One of the underlying causes of this anomaly is the lack of communication about cancer among Africa-Americans, especially within families. Also, relatively few African-American youth are seeking careers in cancer research, largely due to very little exposure to cancer biology in most of their secondary schools and their teachers’ lack of cancer biology training. Further, few informal programs excite students about careers in cancer biology. RACE21 will build an innovative and effective pipeline to cancer research careers, especially for students underrepresented in cancer research (URM) by building on 5-basic foundations: 1) The University of Alabama at Birmingham’s (UAB) outstanding O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center, 2) Over 200 cancer researchers, eager to mentor high school and college students to become the next generation of cancer researchers, 3) development of an innovative Undergraduate Cancer Biology Major, 4) the Center for Community OutReach Development (CORD), which will train high school biology teachers in cancer research and introduce advanced high school students to cancer research in both formal and informal settings and 5) training in communication about cancer. RACE21 employs successful methods developed at UAB, and uses them to advance cancer biology education. The pipeline starts with high school students being introduced to cancer biology through state-of-the-art experiences in the Summer Science Institute (10 URM rising seniors will be Summer Research Interns) and experiences at the GENEius lab. RACE21 will also provide intense cancer biology training to high school teachers via an annual 3-week BioTeach-Cancer training. RACE21 students (>80% URM) entering UAB’s new Cancer Biology Major will complete a paid summer internship in cancer research in their rising year 1 and 2, and in year 3 and 4 they will receive fellowships as cancer researchers. Each year 10 RACE21 students will complete the undergraduate major, with most continuing to graduate school in cancer research related areas. The Intellectual Merit of RACE21 will be in testing a pipeline that leads to increased minorities in cancer biology careers. The Broader Impacts will annually educate about 6,000 minority students, families and the public about cancer biology and launch the cancer research careers of >40 minority students. Roadmap for America's Cancer Explorers for the 21st Century (RACE21) is an interdisciplinary program to expand the pipeline to a diverse 21st century cancer research workforce for the US. RACE21 will test an innovative pathway leading high school students to increased interest in cancer research, completion of a new Undergraduate Cancer Biology Major and careers in cancer research.

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (1 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (1 of 3)",10012757,U54CA163069,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' minority institution ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' oncology trial ', ' ']",NCI,MEHARRY MEDICAL COLLEGE,U54,2020,1526826,0.08545320989531527
"Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) requests renewal of support for the project “Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer.” The funds will provide Minority Scholar in Cancer Research Awards to support the attendance of young scientists from NIH- recognized minority populations at high-caliber national scientific meetings. This project is an integral part of a multi-level program instituted by the AACR to address the problem of underrepresentation of minorities working in cancer research and biomedical science. The AACR is grateful for the National Cancer Institute (NCI)’s 30 years of support of minorities in cancer research, and anticipates continuing the success of this program in 2016-2021. The Minority Scholar in Cancer Research Awards expose early-career minority scientists to the best and most current cancer science and medicine through their participation in AACR Annual Meetings and Special Conferences. In addition to exposure to cutting-edge cancer research, scholar awardees also gain access to mentoring and networking contacts with experienced investigators, career-building showcases for their achievements, and professional advancement advice. These awards are given annually to minority undergraduate students, graduate students, medical students, residents, and clinical and postdoctoral fellows to support their participation at the meeting or conference. These awards have been generously supported through this R13 funding mechanism from 1985-2015, and through bridge funding during the most recent program year, 2015-2016, while a professional evaluation of the program was finalized. With this application, AACR is proud to share the results of this evaluation, conducted by Thomson Reuters (Scientific) LLC. Career gains for Minority Scholar awardees were demonstrated to be greater than those of unsuccessful applicants on at least two measures: publications and career promotions. Analysis confirmed the significant and durable benefits for scholar awardees that have also been attested to by scholar awardee narratives throughout the years. 1 This project is a critical initiative by the AACR to address the issue of minority underrepresentation in cancer research, operating to encourage more minority scientists to contribute to and persevere in the field of cancer research. Minority cancer researchers have many unique roles to play in cancer research, including mentoring future minority students, and adding diverse voices to this field of study to produce innovation. But perhaps the most important is to improve outcomes for minority patients. Minority research scientists could be more successful in balancing the diversity of clinical trial subjects and more successful in inspiring the trust of subjects. Dedicated minority researchers also have the potential to succeed with behavioral interventions that require outreach to minority communities, due to sensitivity to cultures and even the locations of targeted populations. 1",Young Minority Scientists in the Field of Cancer,9989061,R13CA040577,"['Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Authorship ', ' Award ', ' Behavior Therapy ', ' Behavior Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavior Modification ', ' Behavior Treatment ', ' Behavioral Conditioning Therapy ', ' Behavioral Modification ', ' Behavioral Therapy ', ' Behavioral Treatment ', ' Conditioning Therapy ', ' behavior intervention ', ' behavioral intervention ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Equilibrium ', ' balance ', ' balance function ', ' Exhibits ', ' Future ', ' Goals ', ' Grant ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' Institutes ', ' Learning ', ' Medicine ', ' Mentors ', ' United States National Institutes of Health ', ' NIH ', ' National Institutes of Health ', ' Patients ', ' Play ', ' Program Evaluation ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Role ', ' social role ', ' Science ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Target Populations ', ' Time ', ' Travel ', ' Voice ', ' Measures ', ' conference ', ' convention ', ' summit ', ' symposia ', ' symposium ', ' career ', ' Clinical ', ' Evaluation ', ' Trust ', ' Funding ', ' Collaborations ', ' Exposure to ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Location ', ' meetings ', ' Postdoc ', ' Research Associate ', ' post-doc ', ' post-doctoral ', ' Postdoctoral Fellow ', ' Education and Training ', ' Training and Education ', ' experience ', ' field based data ', ' field learning ', ' field test ', ' field study ', ' success ', ' knowledgebase ', ' knowledge base ', ' skills ', ' expectation ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' Institution ', ' Diameter ', ' Caliber ', ' Address ', ' International ', ' NCI Organization ', ' National Cancer Institute ', ' AACR ', ' American Association of Cancer Research ', ' Cancer Science ', ' Funding Mechanisms ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' next generation ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' improved outcome ', ' minority investigator ', ' minority scientist ', ' minority undergraduate ', ' minority student ', ' minority communities ', ' ']",NCI,AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR CANCER RESEARCH,R13,2020,36443,0.13871979820142283
"2/2:  UHCOP-DLDCCC alliance: Cancer drug discovery/development and education SUMMARY OF P20 APPLICATION Our University of Houston College of Pharmacy (UHCOP)-Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) alliance will develop the infrastructure for a joint drug discovery/development research program to treat cancers with a health disparity and a joint Cancer Research Education Program (CREP). This alliance is built on complementary expertise in cutting-edge cancer drug discovery technologies at DLDCCC/Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) and in development of cancer drugs at UHCOP. The UHCOP is a constituent of the University of Houston (UH), which is an institution serving underserved health disparity populations (ISUPS). UHCOP faculty members bring a unique perspective from an ISUPS, which is complemented by a wealth of pharmaceutical discovery and development experience, existing programs for undergraduate research, and clinical expertise in working with underserved communities. The DLDCCC, an NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center, contributes prominent experience and perspective in current cancer treatments and clinical trials, cutting edge drug discovery technologies and expertise, cancer research core facilities, and existing undergraduate and graduate training and education programs, including those for patients with cancer health disparities. UHCOP and BCM are member institutions of the Texas Medical Center, the largest medical center in the world. The UHCOP/DLDCCC alliance will be led by an Administrative Core, comprised of senior and experienced investigators in drug discovery/development and cancer biology research. The Internal Advisory Committee (IAC), composed of experienced and senior cancer research and/or education experts, will guide the alliance to ensure the successful completion of the proposed goals. The Administrative Core and IAC will serve as mentors to Co-Leaders of pilot projects, the CREP, and participating early-stage investigators and underrepresented (UR) trainees. We have selected two co-developed and collaborative Pilot Projects, from a total of six, to demonstrate the feasibility of the joint infrastructure for drug discovery/development research investigating cancers with health disparities. These pilot projects have strong potential to launch bi-institutional, NIH-funded cancer drug discovery/development programs and create state-of-the-art cancer research training opportunities. We have co-developed a synergistic CREP that will encourage and prepare UR trainees to enter careers in cancer research. Through research experiences, cancer-specific curricula, and education outreach efforts to the UR trainees, the CREP will provide a platform for long-term sustained efforts for enlarging the pipeline of UR trainees in cancer research. The ultimate goal of the UHCOP-DLDCCC alliance will be to support a multiplier effect by developing joint infrastructure in drug discovery/development, education, and novel cancer technologies to target the unmet need of tackling cancer health disparities and generate preliminary data for successful subsequent NCI R-type grant funding. PROJECT NARRATIVE (OVERALL) Our collaborative P20 proposal from the University of Houston College of Pharmacy (UHCOP) and the Dan L. Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center (DLDCCC) at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM) will develop an interdependent infrastructure for a long-term drug discovery/development research program and a cancer research education program (CREP) to address cancers displaying health disparities and to produce preliminary data for subsequent NCI R-type grant opportunities.

"1/2 Langston University- UNTHSC Partnership for Cancer Research and Education With the current US population continuing to grow at its current pace, nearly 50% of the US population in 2050 will be from medically underserved, vulnerable populations. Substantial evidence exists for the underrepresentation of minorities (individuals from underrepresented racial and ethnic groups, people with disabilities and from disadvantaged backgrounds) in all levels of the biomedical workforce (from the undergraduate level to the professoriate). Racial/ethnic populations demonstrate increased incidence and/or more aggressive disease for specific cancer types. Even when accounting for socioeconomic and access to care factors, incidence and mortality differences persist between racial/ethnic populations for some cancer types. Recent studies indicate that these unequal cancer burdens may be due to a complex biology that needs to be investigated to increase our basic understanding of cancer health disparities. There is a lack of diversity in the professional fields of healthcare and research, which strive to treat and eliminate the health disparities that exist in cancer prevalent throughout the United States. This proposal will focus on promoting diversity in individuals engaged cancer research and cancer disparities by developing a partnership between the Institute for Cancer Research at University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC) and Langston University (LU), the only historically black college in Oklahoma. The Objective of the proposed partnership is to promote cancer-related research, cancer research experience and cancer education to undergraduate students and junior faculty. Each of the activities will be jointly developed and implemented at LU and UNTHSC. We will meet our objectives through three Specific Aims: Aim 1) Establish an Administrative Core (AC) that will be responsible for the overall implementation, management, and evaluation of the success of the various components of the partnership, Aim 2) Promote interdisciplinary and collaborative cancer research involving faculty from UNTHSC and LU, and support two pilot research projects, and Aim 3) Develop a Cancer Research Education Program (CREP) that provides students and junior faculty with cancer education, cancer research experiences, experimental design, interprofessional education (IPE) and health disparities. Our expectation is that by meeting our objectives, we will directly impact eventual achievement of our goal of establishing a long- term partnership between LU and UNTHSC with an ultimate outcome of obtaining a diverse population comprised of underrepresented populations in health disparity research related to cancer. Innovative features of proposed partnership program are (1) focus on the development of research excellence and professionalism in cancer and health disparities among the underrepresented and disadvantageous scholars; (2) extended active coaching integrated with interprofessional training programs and academic training, and (3) developing interdisciplinary cancer research teams. These activities will have a significant impact on increasing the success of URM and other disadvantaged groups in health disparity research related to cancer. Project Narrative There are three overarching goals of this project: 1) Plan and implement a collaborative partnership between Langston University and UNT Health Science Center. 2) Support two collaborative pilot cancer research projects and 3) Provide cancer education, cancer research training and professional development to underrepresented minority students and students from disadvantaged backgrounds and disabilities who will pursue cancer disparity research.",1/2 Langston University- UNTHSC Partnership for Cancer Research and Education,10018471,P20CA233391,"['Academic Training ', ' Accounting ', ' Achievement ', ' Achievement Attainment ', ' Affect ', ' Biology ', ' Biomedical Research ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Disadvantaged ', ' Disease ', ' Disorder ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Ethnic group ', ' ethnicity group ', ' Experimental Designs ', ' Faculty ', ' Goals ', ' Disabled Persons ', ' Disabled Population ', ' Handicapped ', ' People with Disabilities ', ' Persons with Disabilities ', ' disabled ', ' disabled individual ', ' disabled people ', ' individuals with disabilities ', ' Health Services Accessibility ', ' Access to Care ', ' access to health services ', ' access to services ', ' access to treatment ', ' accessibility to health services ', ' availability of services ', ' care access ', ' health service access ', ' health services availability ', ' service availability ', ' treatment access ', ' Incidence ', ' Institutes ', ' Light ', ' Photoradiation ', ' mortality ', ' Oklahoma ', ' Physicians ', ' Race ', ' Racial Group ', ' Racial Stocks ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Students ', ' Texas ', ' Training Programs ', ' United States ', ' Universities ', ' diverse populations ', ' heterogeneous population ', ' population diversity ', ' Population Heterogeneity ', ' Caring ', ' career ', ' Evaluation ', ' disability ', ' Individual ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' programs ', ' Scientist ', ' Investigation ', ' Complex ', ' meetings ', ' experience ', ' success ', ' expectation ', ' Participant ', ' response ', ' cancer education ', ' vulnerable group ', ' Vulnerable Populations ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Health Sciences ', ' Research Training ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Research Programs ', ' Cancer Research Project ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' socio-economic ', ' socio-economically ', ' socioeconomically ', ' socioeconomics ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' Health Care Professional ', ' Healthcare professional ', ' Health Professional ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' innovate ', ' innovative ', ' innovation ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' racial and ethnic ', ' medically underserved ', ' HBCUs ', ' Historically Black Colleges ', ' Historically Black Institution ', ' Historically Black University ', ' Historically Black Colleges and Universities ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' URM student ', ' underrepresented minority student ', ' education research ', ' Underrepresented Populations ', ' disadvantaged student ', ' minority student ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' healthcare research ', ' Health Care Research ', ' ']",NCI,LANGSTON UNIVERSITY,P20,2020,210731,0.16107893398270742

"MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3) SUMMARY Particular emphasis is devoted in the US to identify the determinants of, and eventually remedies, for the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities. Incidence rates for many forms of cancer are higher among blacks than whites. The disparity is compounded by lower rates of relative survival for almost all cancers, so that age-adjusted mortality rates are substantially higher among African Americans than whites for about two-thirds of all types of cancers. Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to focus the efforts of diverse investigators working across many disciplines to address health disparities in NCI designated cancer centers and to develop research infrastructure, capacity and effectiveness of minority-serving institutions. Collectively, these efforts offer the best opportunity to overcome cancer disparities and optimize research resources and infrastructure. Our Partnership has matured and developed strong, successful collaborative interactions based on excellence, true reciprocity and mutual benefit to achieve this goal. Moreover, this Partnership is geographically placed in a region with the highest cancer incidence in the US, pointing to the enormous potential for improved outcomes through the proposed work. We are dedicated to enhancing the strengths and eliminating the weaknesses of our three institutions as we move toward our shared goal of eliminating cancer disparities. The overall objectives of this competing renewal application are to: (1) increase and stabilize the competitive cancer research capability of Meharry Medical College (MMC) and Tennessee State University (TSU); (2) create stable, long-term collaborative relationships between MMC, TSU and the Vanderbilt Ingram Cancer Center (VICC) in cancer research, research education, career development and cancer outreach; (3) expand access to clinical trials for minority populations served by Nashville General Hospital (NGH)/MMC, and (4) improve the effectiveness of VICC research, career development, education and outreach activities specifically designed to benefit minority populations served by VICC. All activities will be monitored by an Internal Advisory Committee and the Program Steering Committee with representation from the NCI. A sustained and comprehensive Cancer Partnership is of immense benefit to the three participating institutions as well as the mid-South region of the US. The common mission statement for our Cancer Partnership is to conduct rigorous basic, translational and clinical research directed towards the reduction of disparities in the incidence and treatment of cancer through a multidisciplinary collaborative approach to research, education and community engagement. As a triad we will amplify cancer research capabilities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community, improve and document outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities, minimize or eliminate measurable disparities in the incidence of cancer among minority populations, and fortify collaborations among the three partner organizations. RELEVANCE Our Cancer Partnership provides an exceptional environment to identify the determinants and address the disproportionate share of the cancer burden borne by underrepresented minorities, as evidenced by higher incidence rates and lower rates of relative survival. The conduct of minority-targeted cancer research, development of research infrastructure, enhancement of minority education programs and improvement to the capacity/effectiveness of cancer-related activities will address these health disparities in the greater Nashville academic and healthcare community with the ultimate goal to improve outcomes in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer in minority and underserved communities.","MMC, VICC & TSU: Partners in Eliminating Cancer Disparities (3 of 3)",10005131,U54CA163066,"['Age ', ' ages ', ' Award ', ' Awareness ', ' Biometry ', ' Biometrics ', ' Biostatistics ', ' Malignant Neoplasms ', ' Cancers ', ' Malignant Tumor ', ' malignancy ', ' neoplasm/cancer ', ' Clinical Research ', ' Clinical Study ', ' Clinical Trials ', ' Communities ', ' Diagnosis ', ' Education ', ' Educational aspects ', ' Environment ', ' Faculty ', ' Geography ', ' Goals ', ' Growth ', ' Generalized Growth ', ' Tissue Growth ', ' ontogeny ', ' General Hospitals ', ' Incidence ', ' Joints ', ' Mission ', ' mortality ', ' Pathology ', ' Peer Review ', ' Publications ', ' Scientific Publication ', ' Research ', ' research and development ', ' Development and Research ', ' R & D ', ' R&D ', ' Research Personnel ', ' Investigators ', ' Researchers ', ' Resources ', ' Research Resources ', ' medical schools ', ' medical college ', ' school of medicine ', ' Medical Students ', ' medical school students ', ' Tennessee ', ' Universities ', ' Work ', ' Triad Acrylic Resin ', ' Triad ', ' Triad resin ', ' Afro American ', ' Afroamerican ', ' Black Populations ', ' black American ', ' African American ', ' Task Forces ', ' advisory team ', ' Advisory Committees ', ' base ', ' career ', ' improved ', ' Series ', ' Discipline ', ' Fostering ', ' R-Series Research Projects ', ' R01 Mechanism ', ' R01 Program ', ' Research Grants ', ' Research Projects ', ' Research Project Grants ', ' Collaborations ', ' programs ', ' high school ', ' Basic Research ', ' Basic Science ', ' graduate student ', ' outreach ', ' career development ', ' outreach program ', ' cancer education ', ' Cancer Treatment ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Therapy ', ' Malignant Neoplasm Treatment ', ' anti-cancer therapy ', ' anticancer therapy ', ' cancer therapy ', ' Health Educators ', ' Bio-Informatics ', ' Bioinformatics ', ' disparity in health ', ' health disparity ', ' Institution ', ' Effectiveness ', ' Address ', ' Core Facility ', ' Instruction and Outreach ', ' Training and Outreach ', ' Tutoring and Outreach ', ' Education and Outreach ', ' Measurable ', ' NCI-Designated Cancer Center ', ' Center for Cancer Research ', ' NCI Center for Cancer Research ', ' Research Infrastructure ', ' National Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Burden ', ' Cancer Center ', ' Translational Science ', ' translation research ', ' Translational Research ', ' Underrepresented Ethnic Minority ', ' under-representation of minorities ', ' underrepresentation of minorities ', ' Underrepresented Minority ', ' Monitor ', ' Community Health ', ' developmental ', ' Development ', ' pathway ', ' Pathway interactions ', ' anti-cancer research ', ' cancer research ', ' anticancer research ', ' designing ', ' design ', ' Minority ', ' Outcome ', ' Population ', ' cancer type ', ' cancer disparity ', ' disparity in cancer ', ' cancer health disparity ', ' community organizations ', ' multidisciplinary ', ' minority institution ', ' Minority-Serving Institution ', ' undergraduate ', ' undergraduate student ', ' education research ', ' improved outcome ', ' reduce disparity ', ' disparity reduction ', ' health care community ', ' healthcare community ', ' collaborative approach ', ' oncology trial ', ' ']",NCI,TENNESSEE STATE UNIVERSITY,U54,2020,938637,0.08545320989531527
