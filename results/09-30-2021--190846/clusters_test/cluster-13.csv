"Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation Project Summary: It is of great fundamental and biomedical importance to understand the physical princi- ples that govern the coupling between the chemical step in a biomolecule and other events, such as penetration of water molecules into the active site, recruitment of transient metal ions, or conformational rearrangements near and afar. This is a challenging task, however, due to the intrinsic multi-scale nature of the problem. As a result, our understanding in factors that dictate the efﬁciency and speciﬁcity of enzyme catalysis remains in- complete, especially regarding contributions beyond the active site; this knowledge gap has greatly limited our ability to design highly efﬁcient enzymes de novo. Motivated by these considerations, the overarching theme of our research is to develop and apply multi-scale computational methods to reveal the underlying mechanism of enzyme catalysis at an atomic level, with a particular emphasis on establishing to what degree the chem- ical step is coupled with other processes proximal or distal to the active site. Speciﬁcally, we aim to develop an efﬁcient QM/MM framework to compute free energy proﬁles of enzyme reactions with a good balance of computational speed and accuracy; further integration with enhanced sampling approaches, machine learning techniques and modern computational hardwares enables us to gain insights into the nature of coupling be- tween the chemical step and other events during the functional cycle. Accordingly, we are in a unique position to pursue several lines of exciting applications, which include the mechanism and impact of transient metal ion recruiting in nucleic acid processing enzymes, the catalytic and regulatory mechanism of peripheral membrane enzymes, and systemic analysis of allosteric coupling in a transcription factor; an emerging research direction is to explore the interplay of stability, catalytic activity, and allostery during continuous directed evolution. Our project integrates computational method developments with applications inspired by recent experimental ad- vances, such as time-resolved crystallography, deep mutational scanning and continuous directed evolution. The research efforts will lead to novel computational tools and mechanistic insights into the regulatory mech- anisms of enzymes by processes either near or remote from the active site. Thus the project will have both fundamental impacts and implications for better design strategies for catalysis and allostery in biomolecules. Narrative: The computational methodologies we develop will be applicable to a broad set of metalloen- zymes and proteins of biomedical relevance. In particular, we target fundamental mechanistic problems in enzymes that catalyze nucleic acids synthesis/modiﬁcation and lipid metabolism, since mutations in these en- zymes are implicated in numerous human diseases such as cancer, insulin resistance and diabetes. Although our project does not focus on design of drugs, the mechanistic insights into enzyme catalysis and allosteric regulation will broaden strategies that can be used to target various enzymes of biomedical signiﬁcance.",Computational Analysis of Enzyme Catalysis and Regulation,10206585,R35GM141930,"['Active Sites', 'Allosteric Regulation', 'Catalysis', 'Chemicals', 'Computer Analysis', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Coupling', 'Crystallography', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Directed Molecular Evolution', 'Distal', 'Drug Design', 'Enzymes', 'Equilibrium', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Ions', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Membrane', 'Metals', 'Modernization', 'Modification', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Mutation', 'Nature', 'Nucleic Acids', 'Penetration', 'Peripheral', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Reaction', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Specificity', 'Speed', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Tweens', 'Water', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'enzyme mechanism', 'human disease', 'insight', 'lipid metabolism', 'method development', 'mutation screening', 'novel', 'recruit', 'transcription factor']",NIGMS,BOSTON UNIVERSITY (CHARLES RIVER CAMPUS),R35,2021,295591
"Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core OVERALL SUMMARY The capability to chemically identify thousands of metabolites and other chemicals in clinical samples will revolutionize the search for environmental, dietary, and metabolic determinants of disease. By comparison to near-comprehensive genetic information, comparatively little is understood of the totality of the human metabolome, largely due to insufficiencies in molecular identification methods. Through innovations in computational chemistry and advanced ion mobility separations coupled with mass spectrometry, we propose to overcome a significant, long standing obstacle in the field of metabolomics: the absence of methods for accurate and comprehensive identification of metabolites without relying on data from analysis of authentic chemical standards. A paradigm shift in metabolomics, we will use gas-phase molecular properties that can be both accurately predicted computationally and consistently measured experimentally, and which can thus be used for comprehensive identification of the metabolome without the need for authentic chemical standards. The outcomes of this proposal directly advance the mission and goals of the NIH Common Fund by: (i) transforming metabolomics science by enabling consideration of the totality of the human metabolome through optimized identification of currently unidentifiable molecules, eventually reaching hundreds of thousands of molecules, and (ii) developing standardized computational tools and analytical methods to increase the national capacity for biomedical researchers to identify metabolites quickly and accurately. This work is significant because it enables comprehensive and confident chemical measurement of the metabolome. This work is innovative because it utilizes an integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational pipeline to accurately predict physical-chemical properties of metabolites coupled to measurements. OVERALL NARRATIVE This project will utilize integrated quantum-chemistry and machine learning computational computational approaches coupled with advanced instrumentation to characterize the human metabolome, and identify currently unidentifiable molecules without the use of authentic chemical standards. Results from these studies will contribute to the goal of understanding diseases, and the tools and resources will be made publically available for biomedical researchers.",Pacific Northwest Advanced Compound Identification Core,10213202,U2CES030170,"['Adoption', 'Algorithms', 'Analytical Chemistry', 'Attributes of Chemicals', 'Biological', 'Biological Markers', 'Biomedical Research', 'Chemical Structure', 'Chemicals', 'Clinical', 'Communities', 'Computers and Advanced Instrumentation', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Coupled', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Databases', 'Dependence', 'Disease', 'Educational workshop', 'Engineering', 'Exposure to', 'Funding', 'Gases', 'Genetic', 'Goals', 'High Performance Computing', 'Human', 'Isotopes', 'Libraries', 'Liquid substance', 'Machine Learning', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Metabolic', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Outcome', 'Pacific Northwest', 'Phase', 'Predictive Analytics', 'Probability', 'Procedures', 'Property', 'Reference Standards', 'Research Personnel', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Serum', 'Source', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Supercomputing', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Toxin', 'Training', 'Uncertainty', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Urine', 'Work', 'analytical method', 'base', 'chemical property', 'chemical standard', 'comparative', 'computational chemistry', 'computational pipelines', 'computerized tools', 'dark matter', 'dietary', 'drug candidate', 'drug discovery', 'experience', 'genetic information', 'human disease', 'improved', 'in silico', 'innovation', 'instrumentation', 'ion mobility', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel therapeutics', 'programs', 'quantum chemistry', 'small molecule libraries', 'stereochemistry', 'tool']",NIEHS,BATTELLE PACIFIC NORTHWEST LABORATORIES,U2C,2021,981634
"A knowledge graph framework for automated gating analysis of cytometry data Project Summary / Abstract Flow and mass cytometry provide multiparametric single-cell data critical for understanding the cellular heterogeneity in various biological systems. Modern polychromatic flow cytometers simultaneously measure about 16 parameters routinely. The next-generation mass cytometry (CyTOF) technology allows for the simultaneous measurement of 50 or more parameters. Even as the cytometry technology is rapidly advancing, approaches for analyzing such complex data remain inadequate. The widely-used manual gating analysis is knowledge-driven and easy-to- interpret, but it is subjective, labor-intensive, and not scalable to handle the increasing complexity of the data. Recent developments of automated data-driven algorithms are able to address the issues of manual gating, but the results from data-driven algorithms are often not intuitive for biology experts to interpret. These limitations create a critical bottleneck for flow and mass cytometry analysis. The overall objective of this application is to develop a novel framework that combines both knowledge-driven and data-driven approaches to achieve automated gating analysis of flow cytometry and CyTOF data. The specific aims are: (1) build knowledge graphs to capture existing knowledge of manual gating analysis, (2) develop algorithms for automated gating analysis, and (3) validate the knowledge graph framework using large-scale studies in ImmPort. The proposed research is significant because it will enable efficient and reproducible gating analysis and provide visualizations that are easy-to-interpret, both of which are critically important to the research community. Such contributions will fundamentally impact single-cell analysis of cellular heterogeneity in diverse fields including immunology, infectious diseases, cancer, AIDS, among others. Project Narrative The proposed research is relevant to public health because it is expected to develop novel computational methods for automated analysis and interpretation of single-cell analysis by flow and mass cytometry.

"Integrating multidimensional genomic data to discover clinically-relevant predictive models The goal of this NIH Pathway to Independence award is to provide Dr. Brittany Lasseigne with an extensive training program to prepare her to be an effective independent investigator who uses computational genomics to study complex human diseases. We propose a formal one-year training and mentoring program in genomics, computer science, statistics, and career development to build on her 8+ years of hands-on training, followed by a three-year structured and independent research program. Research will focus on the integration of multidimensional genomic data sets in the context of complex human diseases. A critical barrier in genomic research is the complexity of data integration: the ability to leverage overlapping and unique information captured by different genomic assays would improve our understanding of data integration and generate clinically relevant genomic signatures. To meet this need, we propose to integrate a combination of genomic data we generated with public data to (1) infer genomic instability signatures from different data types, (2) improve clinically relevant phenotype prediction by building multi-omics machine learning classifiers and reducing phenotype heterogeneity, and (3) create a cloud-enabled R package and associated Shiny application to accelerate future research. The proposed work will advance our understanding of data integration, allow inference of genomic instabilities across data sets, and generate high performance classifiers for assessing clinically relevant phenotypes in both cancer and psychiatric disease using frameworks that will be broadly applicable across other complex diseases. It will also facilitate prioritization of experiments in future studies by informing on the orthogonality of genomic assays, thereby allowing more efficient study designs to capture as much information as possible within a given sample size or scope of experimentation. Collectively, this additional training will allow Dr. Lasseigne to develop new multidimensional data integration approaches and translational questions applicable across complex diseases when independent. Dr. Richard Myers (HudsonAlpha) and Dr. Gregory Cooper (HudsonAlpha), leaders in applying genetics and genomics to complex human diseases, and an Advisory Committee of additional experts including Dr. Barbara Wold (Caltech), Dr. Eddy Yang (UAB), and Dr. Timothy Reddy (Duke), will provide mentoring throughout this award. The mentored phase will take place at the HudsonAlpha Institute for Biotechnology, an ideal environment for this training with extensive translational science collaborations, expert faculty and staff, and state-of-the art computational and laboratory resources devoted to genomics. This combination will maximize Dr. Lasseigne's training program, facilitating her transition to an independent, tenure-track investigator at a university with a strong commitment to data-driven approaches to complex human disease research, i.e. strong genomics research programs with clinical collaborators, ideally at, or affiliated with, an academic medical center. Project Narrative The major outcome of this project will be a scientist with the necessary research, mentoring, teaching, and career development training to run an independent research program in computational genomics.

"Integrating genomic and clinical data to predict disease phenotypes using heterogeneous ensembles PROJECT SUMMARY Genomic and other “omic” profiles hold immense potential for advancing personalize/precision medicine by enabling the accurate prediction of disease phenotypes or outcomes for individual patients, which can be used by a clinician to design an appropriate plan of care. However, despite this potential, the actual impact of these omic profiles on disease phenotype prediction may be limited by the fact that even large cohorts collecting these data do not cover large enough numbers of individuals. In contrast, a variety of clinical data types, such as laboratory tests and physician notes, are routinely collected and studied for a much larger number of patients undergoing treatment for such diseases at medical centers. The abundance of these clinical data, and their complementarity with multi-omic data, offer an opportunity to advance personalized medicine by integrating these disparate types of data. However, this disparity in data formats, namely several omic profiles being structured, and several clinical data types, such as physician notes, being unstructured, poses challenges for this integration. An associated challenge due to this disparity is that different classes of computational methods are likely to be the most effective for predicting disease phenotypes from these clinical and omics datasets. These challenges pose barriers for current data integration methods to address this problem. Here, we propose an innovative approach to this integration by assimilating diverse base phenotype predictors inferred from individual clinical and omics datasets into heterogeneous ensembles. These ensembles, which have shown promise for several other computational genomics problems, can aggregate an unrestricted number and variety of base predictors, which is ideal for this integration problem. Specifically, we describe how existing heterogeneous ensemble methods for single datasets can be transformed and advanced to address the multiple clinical and omic dataset integration problem. In particular, we detail novel algorithms for improving these integrative ensembles by modeling and incorporating the inherent patient and dataset heterogeneity in these datasets. We also propose novel algorithms for leveraging the inherent complementarity among clinical and omic datasets, as well as an innovative approach for handling expected missing data, both with the goal of making ensemble phenotype predictors more accurate and applicable to patient cohorts. To assess the performance of this novel suite of data integration-oriented heterogeneous ensembles, we will validate their effectiveness for predicting asthma and Inflammatory Bowel Disease phenotypes in substantial patient cohorts with diverse omics and clinical datasets. We will publicly release efficient software implementations of the methods developed in this project to enable others to carry out similar analyses with other diverse data collections. Successful accomplishment of the proposed work will contribute to the advancement of personalized medicine through accurate individualized prediction of disease phenotypes. Predictive modeling is expected to become a cornerstone on the path to achieving precision/personalized medicine, as one of the key tasks here will be making individualized predictions of disease characteristics/phenotypes like subtype and risk of progression and/or recurrence. We propose several innovative computational algorithms for developing accurate predictive models that integrate diverse clinical and omic data, as well as several rigorous validation exercises that will demonstrate the capabilities of these models.

"Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM PROJECT SUMMARY Single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) has recently joined X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy as a high-resolution structural method for biological macromolecules. In addition, cryo-EM produces images of individual molecules, and therefore has the potential to resolve conformational changes. The proposal aims to develop new algorithms and software for extending the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing computational tools for cryo-EM. This extension requires solving two of the most challenging computational problems posed by cryo-EM. First, mapping the structural variability of macromolecules is widely recognized as the main computational challenge in cryo-EM. Structural variations are of great significance to biologists, as they provide insight into the functioning of molecular machines. Existing computational tools are limited to a small number of distinct conformations, and therefore are incapable of tackling highly mobile biomolecules with multiple, continuous spectra of conformational changes. The first area of investigation in this project is the development of a computational framework to analyze continuous variability. The proposed approach is based on a new mathematical representation of continuously changing structures and its efficient estimation using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. MCMC algorithms have found great success in many other scientific disciplines, yet they have been mostly overlooked for cryo-EM single particle analysis. Second, a major limiting factor for present cryo-EM studies is the molecule size. Images of small molecules (below ~50kDa) have too little signal to allow existing methods to provide valid 3-D reconstructions. It is commonly believed that cryo-EM cannot be used for molecules that are too small to be reliably detected and picked from micrographs. Challenging that widespread belief, the second area of investigation focuses on developing a groundbreaking approach for reconstructing small molecules directly from micrographs without particle picking. The new approach is based on autocorrelation analysis and completely bypasses particle picking and orientation assignment and requires just one pass over the data. The single-pass approach opens new possibilities for real-time processing during data acquisition. PROJECT NARRATIVE Determining structures of proteins and other large molecules is an essential step in the basic understanding of biological processes, and a first step in rational drug design. We propose to develop new, faster and more reliable computer algorithms to significantly increase the power of structure-determination using electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM). Importantly, our methods will broaden the application of cryo-EM to molecules that are either too small or too flexible to be mapped by existing techniques.",Reconstruction of heterogeneous and small macromolecules by cyro-EM,10163220,R01GM136780,"['3-Dimensional', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Belief', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Bypass', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Cryoelectron Microscopy', 'Crystallization', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diffusion', 'Dimensions', 'Discipline', 'Drug Design', 'Fostering', 'G-Protein-Coupled Receptors', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genome', 'Image', 'Individual', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Ion Channel', 'Ion Pumps', 'Machine Learning', 'Maps', 'Markov Chains', 'Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology', 'Mathematics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Molecular Machines', 'Molecular Motors', 'Molecular Weight', 'Motion', 'NMR Spectroscopy', 'Names', 'Noise', 'Particle Size', 'Phase', 'Polymerase', 'Preparation', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Resolution', 'Ribosomes', 'Roentgen Rays', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Spliceosomes', 'Structural Protein', 'Structure', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Uncertainty', 'Update', 'Variant', 'Work', 'X-Ray Crystallography', 'base', 'computer framework', 'computerized data processing', 'computerized tools', 'data acquisition', 'expectation', 'flexibility', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'macromolecule', 'molecular mass', 'novel strategies', 'open source', 'particle', 'programs', 'protein complex', 'protein structure', 'receptor', 'reconstruction', 'small molecule', 'statistics', 'success', 'theories', 'three dimensional structure']",NIGMS,PRINCETON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,312940
"Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Candidate: With my multidisciplinary background in Artificial Intelligence (PhD), Public Health Informatics (MS), Epidemiology and Health Statistics (MS), and Preventive Medicine (Bachelor of Medicine), my career goal is to become an independent investigator working at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Biomedicine, with a particular emphasis initially in machine learning and public health. Training plan: My K99/R00 training plan emphasizes machine learning, deep learning and scientific communication skills (presentation, writing articles, and grant applications), which will complement my current strengths in artificial intelligence, statistics, medicine and public health. I have a very strong mentoring team. My mentors, Drs. Michael Becich (primary), Gregory Cooper, Heng Huang, and Michael Wagner, all of whom are experienced with research and professional career development. Research plan: The research goal of my proposed K99/R00 grant is to increase the re-use of computable biomedical knowledge, which is knowledge represented in computer-interpretable formalisms such as Bayesian networks and neural networks. I refer to such representations as models. Although models can be re-used in toto in another setting, there may be loss of performance or, even more problematically, fundamental mismatches between the data required by the model and the data available in the new setting making their re-use impossible. The field of transfer learning develops algorithms for transferring knowledge from one setting to another. Transfer learning, a sub-area of machine learning, explicitly distinguishes between a source setting, which has the model that we would like to re-use, and a target setting, which has data insufficient for deriving a model from data and therefore needs to re-use a model from a source setting. I propose to develop and evaluate several Bayesian Network Transfer Learning (BN- TL) algorithms and a Convolutional Neural Network Transfer Learning algorithm. My specific research aims are to: (1) further develop and evaluate BN-TL for sharing computable knowledge across healthcare settings; (2) develop and evaluate BN-TL for updating computable knowledge over time; and (3) develop and evaluate a deep transfer learning algorithm that combines knowledge in heterogeneous scenarios. I will do this research on models that are used to automatically detect cases of infectious disease such as influenza. Impact: The proposed research takes advantage of large datasets that I previously developed; therefore I expect to quickly have results with immediate implications for how case detection models are shared from a region that is initially experiencing an epidemic to another location that wishes to have optimal case-detection capability as early as possible. More generally, it will bring insight into machine learning enhanced biomedical knowledge sharing and updating. This training grant will prepare me to work independently and lead efforts to develop computational solutions to meet biomedical needs in future R01 projects. Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge Narrative Re-using computable biomedical knowledge in the form of a mathematical model in a new setting is challenging because the new setting may not have data needed as inputs to the model. This project will develop and evaluate transfer learning algorithms, which are computer programs that adapt a model to a new setting by removing and adding local variables to it. The developed methods for re-using models are expected to benefit the public’s health by: (1) improving case detection during epidemics by enabling re-use of automatic case detectors developed in the earliest affected regions with other regions, and, more generally, (2) increasing the impact of NIH’s investment in machine learning by enabling machine-learned models to be used in more institutions and locations.",Transfer learning to improve the re-usability of computable biomedical knowledge,10158538,K99LM013383,"['Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Applications Grants', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bayesian Method', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian Network', 'Big Data', 'Clinical', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Communication', 'Complement', 'Computerized Medical Record', 'Computers', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Epidemic', 'Epidemiology', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Healthcare Systems', 'Heterogeneity', 'Influenza', 'Institution', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Location', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical center', 'Medicine', 'Mentors', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Parainfluenza', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Play', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Process', 'Psychological Transfer', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Informatics', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Role', 'Semantics', 'Societies', 'Source', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Twin Multiple Birth', 'Unified Medical Language System', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Universities', 'Update', 'Utah', 'Work', 'Writing', 'base', 'career', 'career development', 'computer program', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'detector', 'experience', 'health care settings', 'improved', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'learning algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'multidisciplinary', 'neural network', 'skills', 'statistics', 'usability']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH AT PITTSBURGH,K99,2021,93342
"OpenMM: Scalable biomolecular modeling, simulation, and machine learning PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT OpenMM [http://openmm.org] is the most widely-used open source GPU-accelerated framework for biomolecular modeling and simulation (>1300 citations, >270,000 downloads, >1M deployed instances). Its Python API makes it widely popular as both an application (for modelers) and a library (for developers), while its C/C++/Fortran bindings enable major legacy simulation packages to use OpenMM to provide high performance on modern hardware. OpenMM has been used for probing biological questions that leverage the $14B global investment in structural data from the PDB at multiple scales, from detailed studies of single disease proteins to superfamily-wide modeling studies and large-scale drug development efforts in industry and academia. Originally developed with NIH funding by the Pande lab at Stanford, we aim to fully transition toward a community governance and sustainable development model and extend its capabilities to ensure OpenMM can power the next decade of biomolecular research. To fully exploit the revolution in QM-level accuracy with machine-learning (ML) potentials, we will add plug-in support for ML models augmented by GPU-accelerated kernels, enabling transformative science with QM-level accuracy. To enable high-productivity development of new ML models with training dataset sizes approaching 100 million molecules, we will develop a Python framework to enable OpenMM to be easily used within modern ML frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch. Together with continued optimizations to exploit inexpensive GPUs, these advances will power a transformation within biomolecular modeling and simulation, much as deep learning has transformed computer vision. PROJECT NARRATIVE Biomolecular modeling and simulation is a key technology for leveraging the $14B global investment in biomolec- ular structure data in the protein databank to understand the basic molecular mechanisms underlying biology and disease and the development of new therapies. In this proposal, we aim to expand the development of OpenMM, a free and open source biomolecular modeling and simulation package that can exploit a wide range of consumer-grade and high-end graphics processing units (GPUs) to enable researchers and applications built on OpenMM to achieve high performance with extreme ﬂexibility. A key aspect of this proposal is to accelerate research in the emerging ﬁeld of biomolecular machine learning by tightly integrating OpenMM with modern ma- chine learning frameworks, enabling researchers to build, use, and deploy machine learning potentials, collective variables, and integrators to advance the state of biomolecular modeling.","OpenMM: Scalable biomolecular modeling, simulation, and machine learning",10100573,R01GM140090,"['Academia', 'Architecture', 'Automobile Driving', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biological Response Modifier Therapy', 'Biology', 'Chemical Models', 'Chemicals', 'Chemistry', 'Code', 'Communities', 'Computer Vision Systems', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Ecosystem', 'Ensure', 'Event', 'Free Energy', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Goals', 'Home environment', 'Hybrids', 'Industry', 'Investigation', 'Investments', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Libraries', 'Ligands', 'Machine Learning', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Conformation', 'Performance', 'Plug-in', 'Productivity', 'Proteins', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Science', 'Speed', 'Standardization', 'Structure', 'Study models', 'Sustainable Development', 'System', 'Technology', 'TensorFlow', 'Training', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Update', 'Work', 'cluster computing', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'drug development', 'enzyme mechanism', 'flexibility', 'insight', 'interoperability', 'model development', 'models and simulation', 'molecular mechanics', 'next generation', 'novel therapeutics', 'open source', 'operation', 'physical model', 'predictive modeling', 'protein data bank', 'quantum', 'repository', 'simulation', 'small molecule', 'small molecule therapeutics', 'software infrastructure', 'tool']",NIGMS,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,426294
"Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models Project Summary Biomedical data is vastly increasing in quantity, scope, and generality, expanding opportunities to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. Machine learning (ML), a key technology in modern biology that addresses these changing dynamics, aims to infer meaningful interactions among variables by learning their statistical relationships from data consisting of measurements on variables across samples. Accurate inference of such interactions from big biological data can lead to novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, and predictive models for patient outcomes. However, a greatly increased hypothesis space, complex dependencies among variables, and complex “black-box” ML models pose complex, open challenges. To meet these challenges, we have been developing innovative, rigorous, and principled ML techniques to infer reliable, accurate, and interpretable statistical relationships in various kinds of biological network inference problems, pushing the boundaries of both ML and biology. Fundamental limitations of current ML techniques leave many future opportunities to translate inferred statistical relationships into biological knowledge, as exemplified in a standard biomarker discovery problem – an extremely important problem for precision medicine. Biomarker discovery using high-throughput molecular data (e.g., gene expression data) has significantly advanced our knowledge of molecular biology and genetics. The current approach attempts to find a set of features (e.g., gene expression levels) that best predict a phenotype and use the selected features, or molecular markers, to determine the molecular basis for the phenotype. However, the low success rates of replication in independent data and of reaching clinical practice indicate three challenges posed by current ML approach. First, high-dimensionality, hidden variables, and feature correlations create a discrepancy between predictability (i.e., statistical associations) and true biological interactions; we need new feature selection criteria to make the model better explain rather than simply predict phenotypes. Second, complex models (e.g., deep learning or ensemble models) can more accurately describe intricate relationships between genes and phenotypes than simpler, linear models, but they lack interpretability. Third, analyzing observational data without conducting interventional experiments does not prove causal relations. To address these problems, we propose an integrated machine learning methodology for learning interpretable models from data that will: 1) select interpretable features likely to provide meaningful phenotype explanations, 2) make interpretable predictions by estimating the importance of each feature to a prediction, and 3) iteratively validate and refine predictions through interventional experiments. For each challenge, we will develop a generalizable ML framework that focuses on different aspects of model interpretability and will therefore be applicable to any formerly intractable, high-impact healthcare problems. We will also demonstrate the effectiveness of each ML framework for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Project Narrative The development of effective computational methods that can extract meaningful and interpretable signals from noisy, big data has become an integral part of biomedical research, which aims to discover novel biological processes and clinically translatable outcomes. The proposed research seeks to radically shift the current paradigm in data-driven discovery from “learning a statistical model that best fits specific training data” to “learning an explainable model” for a wide range of topics, from basic science to disease biology to bedside applications. Successful completion of this project will result in novel biological discoveries, therapeutic targets, predictive models for patient outcomes, and powerful computational frameworks generalizable to critical problems in various diseases.",Opening the Black Box of Machine Learning Models,10224845,R35GM128638,"['Address', 'Basic Science', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biology', 'Biomedical Research', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Effectiveness', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Healthcare', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Linear Models', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patient-Focused Outcomes', 'Phenotype', 'Research', 'Sampling', 'Selection Criteria', 'Signal Transduction', 'Statistical Models', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Translating', 'biomarker discovery', 'clinical practice', 'clinically translatable', 'computer framework', 'deep learning', 'experimental study', 'feature selection', 'high dimensionality', 'innovation', 'inquiry-based learning', 'molecular marker', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'predictive modeling', 'success', 'therapeutic target']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,R35,2021,388750
"National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) OVERALL - PROJECT SUMMARY The mission of the National Resource for Network Biology (NRNB) is to advance the science of biological networks by creating leading-edge bioinformatic methods, software tools and infrastructure, and by engaging the scientific community in a portfolio of collaboration and training opportunities. Much of biomedical research is dependent on knowledge of biological networks of multiple types and scales, including molecular interactions among genes, proteins, metabolites and drugs; cell communication systems; relationships among genotypes and biological and clinical phenotypes; and patient and social networks. NRNB-supported platforms like Cytoscape are among the most widely used software tools in biology, with tens of thousands of active users, enabling researchers to apply network concepts and data to understand biological systems and how they are reprogrammed in disease.  NRNB’s three Technology Research and Development projects introduce innovative concepts with the potential to transform network biology, transitioning it from a static to a dynamic science (TR&D 1); from flat network diagrams to multi-scale hierarchies of biological structure and function (TR&D 2); and from descriptive interaction maps to predictive and interpretable machine learning models (TR&D 3). In previous funding periods our technology projects have produced novel and highly cited approaches, including network-based biomarkers for stratification of disease, data-driven gene ontologies assembled completely from network data, and deep learning models of cell structure and function built using biological networks as a scaffold.  During the next period of support, we introduce dynamic regulatory networks formulated from single-cell transcriptomics and advanced proteomics data (TR&D 1); substantially improved methodology for the study of hierarchical structure and pleiotropy in biological networks (TR&D 2); and procedures for using networks to seed machine learning models of drug response that are both mechanistically interpretable and transferable across biomedical contexts (TR&D 3). These efforts are developed and applied in close collaboration with outside investigators from 19 Driving Biomedical Projects who specialize in experimental generation of network data, disease biology (cancer, neuropsychiatric disorders, diabetes), single-cell developmental biology, and clinical trials. TR&Ds are also bolstered by 7 Technology Partnerships in which NRNB scientists coordinate technology development with leading resource-development groups in gene function prediction, mathematics and algorithm development, and biomedical databases. Beyond these driving collaborations, we continually support a broader portfolio of transient (non-driving) research collaborations; organize and lead international meetings including the popular Network Biology track of the Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology conference; and deliver a rich set of training opportunities and network analysis protocols. OVERALL - PROJECT NARRATIVE We are all familiar with some of the components of biological systems – DNA, proteins, cells, organs, individuals – but understanding biological systems involves more than just cataloging its component parts. It is critical to understand the many interactions of these parts within systems, and how these systems give rise to biological functions and responses and determine states of health and disease.

"Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science The goal of the project is to develop a new mathematical and computational modeling framework for from biomedical data extracted from biomedical experiments such as voltages, spectra (e.g. mass, magnetic resonance, impedance, optical absorption, …), microscopy or radiology images, gene expression, and many others. Scientists who are looking to understand relationships between different molecular and cellular measurements are often faced with questions involving deciphering differences between different cell or organ measurements. Current approaches (e.g. feature engineering and classification, end-to-end neural networks) are often viewed as “black boxes,” given their lack of connection to any biological mechanistic effects. The approach we propose builds from the “ground up” an entirely new modeling framework build based on recently developed invertible transformation. As such, it allows for any machine learning model to be represented in original data space, allowing for not only increased accuracy in prediction, but also direct visualization and interpretation. Preliminary data including drug screening, modeling morphological changes in cancer, cardiac image reconstruction, modeling subcellular organization, and others are discussed. Mathematical data analysis algorithms have enabled great advances in technology for building predictive models from biological data which have been useful for learning about cells and organs, as well as for stratifying patient subgroups in different diseases, and other applications. Given their lack to fundamental biophysics properties, the modeling approaches in current existence (e.g. numerical feature engineering, artificial neural networks) have significant short-comings when applied to biological data analysis problems. The project describes a new mathematical data analysis approach, rooted on transport and related phenomena, which is aimed at greatly enhance our ability to extract meaning from diverse biomedical datasets, while augmenting the accuracy of predictions.",Lagrangian computational modeling for biomedical data science,10063532,R01GM130825,"['3-Dimensional', 'Accountability', 'Address', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Area', 'Biological', 'Biological Models', 'Biology', 'Biophysics', 'Brain', 'Cancer Detection', 'Cartilage', 'Cell model', 'Cells', 'Classification', 'Collaborations', 'Communication', 'Communities', 'Computer Models', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Reporting', 'Data Science', 'Data Scientist', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Screening', 'Engineering', 'Flow Cytometry', 'Fluorescence', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Goals', 'Heart', 'Image', 'Knee', 'Laboratories', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Libraries', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mass Spectrum Analysis', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Medical Imaging', 'Methodology', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Morphology', 'Optics', 'Organ', 'Performance', 'Plant Roots', 'Population', 'Pythons', 'Research', 'Scientist', 'Signal Transduction', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Virginia', 'Visualization', 'absorption', 'algorithm development', 'artificial neural network', 'base', 'biomedical data science', 'biophysical properties', 'brain morphology', 'cellular imaging', 'clinical application', 'clinical practice', 'convolutional neural network', 'cost', 'data space', 'deep learning', 'deep neural network', 'effectiveness testing', 'electric impedance', 'experimental study', 'graphical user interface', 'gray matter', 'heart imaging', 'image reconstruction', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical algorithm', 'mathematical model', 'mathematical theory', 'microscopic imaging', 'models and simulation', 'neural network', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'predictive modeling', 'radiological imaging', 'technology research and development', 'tool', 'voltage']",NIGMS,UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA,R01,2021,360227
"BECKON - Block Estimate Chain: creating Knowledge ON demand & protecting privacy 7. Project Summary/Abstract With the wide adoption of electronic health record systems, cross-institutional genomic medicine predictive modeling is becoming increasingly important, and have the potential to enable generalizable models to accelerate research and facilitate quality improvement initiatives. For example, understanding whether a particular variable has clinical significance depends on a variety of factors, one important one being statistically significant associations between the variant and clinical phenotypes. Multivariate models that predict predisposition to disease or outcomes after receiving certain therapeutic agents can help propel genomic medicine into mainstream clinical care. However, most existing privacy-preserving machine learning methods that have been used to build predictive models given clinical data are based on centralized architecture, which presents security and robustness vulnerabilities such as single-point-of-failure. In this proposal, we will develop novel methods for decentralized privacy-preserving genomic medicine predictive modeling, which can advance comparative effectiveness research, biomedical discovery, and patient-care. Our first aim is to develop a predictive modeling framework on private Blockchain networks. This aim relies on the Blockchain technology and consensus protocols, as well as the online and batch machine learning algorithms, to provide an open-source Blockchain-based privacy-preserving predictive modeling library for further Blockchain-related studies and applications. We will characterize settings in which Blockchain technology offers advances over current technologies. The second aim is to develop a Blockchain-based privacy-preserving genomic medicine modeling architecture for real-world clinical data research networks. These aims are devoted to the mission of the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop biomedical technologies with application domain of genomics and healthcare. The NIH Pathway to Independence Award provides a great opportunity for the applicant to complement his computer science background with biomedical knowledge, and specialized training in machine learning and knowledge-based systems. It will also allow him to investigate new techniques to advance genomic and healthcare privacy protection. The success of the proposed project will help his long-term career goal of obtaining a faculty position at a biomedical informatics program at a major US research university and conduct independently funded research in the field of decentralized privacy-preserving computation. 8. Project Narrative The proposed research will develop practical methods to support privacy-preserving genomic and healthcare predictive modeling, and build innovations based on Blockchain technology for secure and robust machine learning training processes. The development of such privacy technology may increase public trust in research and quality improvement.

"Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function Project Summary mRNA degradation is an essential process in post-translational gene regulation, and influences protein expression levels in cells. In S. cerevisea the lifetime of mRNA ranges from 43 sec to 39 min, with a median half-life of 3.6 min. The molecular factors governing these differential degradation rates has long been an area of active research. Recently though, clear evidence has emerged that the codon optimality correlates with half- lives. At a mechanistic level, the emerging perspective is that some transcripts are translated quickly, and some slowly, and that transcripts in which ribosomes end up forming queues, much like a traffic jam of cars on a highway, are recognized by ubiquitin ligases such as Hel2 that trigger the RQC pathway to promote mRNA degradation. There are two major gaps in this field. The first is the capability to predict mRNA half-lives accurately from mRNA sequence features. The second is understanding at the molecular level how the distribution of codon translation speeds along a transcript’s coding sequence promote ribosome queues and hence degradation. In this proposal, a graduate student will combine the PI’s labs expertise in modeling the kinetics of translation and ribosome traffic with interpretable machine learning techniques to address these two gaps. In achieving this, the field will be advanced by having both predictive and explanatory models for how translation speed and codon usage differentially impacts the degradation rates of different mRNAs. Specifically, our first aim is to build an interpretable machine learning model to identify robust and predictive features governing mRNA degradation. Our second aim is to explain at the molecular level why these features influence degradation rates. We will do this in two ways. First, we will use the essential and predictive features resulting from the interpretable machine learning model to identify potential underlying mechanisms contributing to degradation. Second, we will simulate the movement of ribosomes on each transcript based on reported initiation and elongation rates to detect ribosome queues and provide an explanation for differential degradation rates. Finally, our third aim is to test the predictions coming from the models. For example, do the models from Aim 1 accurately predict mRNA half-lives when synonymous mutations are introduced? There is sufficient published data on transcriptome-wide mRNA half-lives on S. cerevisiae to train and test the machine learning models in Aim 1. Further, we have arranged for a machine learning expert to co-advise the graduate student on the second aim. This co-advisor is already a collaborator of the PI on other machine learning projects. Finally, a collaborator who has measured mRNA half-lives will further advise the student on the third aim. In summary, this training supplement will address cutting edge questions in the molecular biology and biophysics of mRNA lifetimes and provide the student the opportunity to get advanced training and expertise in machine learning, molecular modeling, and experimental techniques. Project Narrative Messenger RNA (mRNA) half-lives are influenced by the rate of protein synthesis and the ribosome traffic jams that can form on transcripts when slow-translating codons are encountered by ribosomes. The complex distribution of codon usage across transcripts, and the interplay of initiation and elongation rates that can create ribosome queues make it difficult to predict an mRNA's half-life based on its sequence. Here, we will apply machine learning to accurately predict mRNA half-lives from sequence, and combine it with biophysical modeling to understand the molecular events regulating mRNA degradation.",Modeling the influence of translation-elongation kinetics on protein structure and function,10307359,R35GM124818,"['Address', 'Area', 'Biophysics', 'Cells', 'Code', 'Codon Nucleotides', 'Complex', 'Coupling', 'Data', 'Event', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Half-Life', 'Kinetics', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Messenger RNA', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Biology', 'Movement', 'Mutation', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Protein Biosynthesis', 'Proteins', 'Publishing', 'Reporter', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Ribosomes', 'Saccharomyces cerevisiae', 'Speed', 'Students', 'Techniques', 'Testing', 'Training', 'Transcript', 'Translating', 'Translations', 'base', 'biophysical model', 'graduate student', 'insight', 'kinetic model', 'mRNA Transcript Degradation', 'models and simulation', 'molecular modeling', 'protein expression', 'protein structure function', 'ribosome profiling', 'simulation', 'transcriptome', 'ubiquitin ligase']",NIGMS,PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY-UNIV PARK,R35,2021,31246
"An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics Immune-repertoire sequence, which consists of an individual's millions of unique antibody and T-cell receptor (TCR) genes, encodes a dynamic and highly personalized record of an individual's state of health. Our long- term goal is to develop the computational models and tools necessary to read this record, to one day be able diagnose diverse infections, autoimmune diseases, cancers, and other conditions directly from repertoire se- quence. The key problem is how to find patterns of specific diseases in repertoire sequence, when repertoires are so complex. Our hypothesis is that a combination of bottom-up (sequence-level) and top-down (systems- level) modeling can reveal these patterns, by encoding repertoires as simple but highly informative models that can be used to build highly sensitive and specific disease classifiers. In preliminary studies, we introduced two new modeling approaches for this purpose: (i) statistical biophysics (bottom-up) and (ii) functional diversity (top-down), and showed their ability to elucidate patterns related to vaccination status (97% accuracy), viral infection, and aging. Building on these studies, we will test our hypothesis through two specific aims: (1) We will develop models and classifiers based on the bottom-up approach, statistical biophysics; and (2) we will de- velop the top-down approach, functional diversity, to improve these classifiers. To achieve these aims, we will use our extensive collection of public immune-repertoire datasets, beginning with 391 antibody and TCR da- tasets we have characterized previously. Our team has deep and complementary expertise in developing computational tools for finding patterns in immune repertoires (Dr. Arnaout) and in the mathematics that under- lie these tools (Dr. Altschul), with additional advice available as needed regarding machine learning (Dr. AlQuraishi). This proposal is highly innovative for how our two new approaches address previous issues in the field. (i) Statistical biophysics uses a powerful machine-learning method called maximum-entropy modeling (MaxEnt), improving on past work by tailoring MaxEnt to learn patterns encoded in the biophysical properties (e.g. size and charge) of the amino acids that make up antibodies/TCRs; these properties ultimately determine what targets antibodies/TCRs can bind, and therefore which sequences are present in different diseases. (ii) Functional diversity fills a key gap in how immunological diversity has been measured thus far, by factoring in whether different antibodies/TCRs are likely to bind the same target. This proposal is highly significant for (i) developing an efficient, accurate, generative, and interpretable machine-learning method for finding diagnostic patterns in repertoire sequence; (ii) applying a robust mathematical framework to the measurement of immuno- logical diversity; (iii) impacting clinical diagnostics; and (iv) adding a valuable new tool for integrative/big-data medicine. The expected outcome of this proposal is an integrated pair of robust and well validated new tools/models for classifying specific disease exposures directly from repertoire sequence. This proposal in- cludes plans to make these tools widely available, to maximize their positive impact across medicine. The proposed research is relevant to public health because B cells/antibodies and T cells play vital roles across such a vast range of health conditions, from infection, to autoimmunity, to cancer, that the ability to de- code what they are doing would be an important step forward for diagnosing these conditions. The proposed research is relevant to the NIH's mission of fostering fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and their applications as a basis for ultimately protecting and improving health, specifically relating to the diagnosis of human diseases.",An Integrated Multilevel Modeling Framework for Repertoire-Based Diagnostics,10165490,R01AI148747,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Aging', 'Amino Acid Motifs', 'Amino Acids', 'Antibodies', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmunity', 'B-Lymphocytes', 'Base Sequence', 'Big Data', 'Binding', 'Biophysics', 'Characteristics', 'Charge', 'Classification', 'Clinical', 'Code', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Disease', 'Ensure', 'Entropy', 'Fostering', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genes', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Immunology', 'Individual', 'Infection', 'Influenza vaccination', 'Intuition', 'Learning', 'Letters', 'Machine Learning', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Mathematics', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Medicine', 'Methods', 'Mission', 'Modeling', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Physics', 'Play', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Privatization', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Reading', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Sampling Errors', 'Signs and Symptoms', 'Speed', 'Statistical Study', 'System', 'T-Cell Receptor', 'T-Cell Receptor Genes', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'Testing', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Vaccination', 'Virus Diseases', 'Work', 'base', 'biophysical properties', 'clinical diagnostics', 'computerized tools', 'diagnostic accuracy', 'human disease', 'immunological diversity', 'improved', 'information model', 'innovation', 'machine learning method', 'multidisciplinary', 'multilevel analysis', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'tool']",NIAID,BETH ISRAEL DEACONESS MEDICAL CENTER,R01,2021,528873
"Advanced Computational Approaches for NMR Data-mining ABSTRACT Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR)-based metabolomics is a powerful method for identifying metabolic perturbations that report on different biological states and sample types. Compared to mass spectrometry, NMR provides robust and highly reproducible quantitative data in a matter of minutes, which makes it very suitable for first-line clinical diagnostics. Although the metabolome is known to provide an instantaneous snap-shot of the biological status of a cell, tissue, and organism, the utilization of NMR in clinical practice is hindered by cumbersome data analysis. Major challenges include high-dimensionality of the data, overlapping signals, variability of resonance frequencies (chemical shift), non-ideal shapes of signals, and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for low concentration metabolites. Existing approaches fail to address these challenges and sample analysis is time-consuming, manually done, and requires considerable knowledge of NMR spectroscopy. Recent developments in the field of sparse methods for machine learning and accelerated convex optimization for high dimensional problems, as well as kernel-based spatial clustering show promise at enabling us to overcome these challenges and achieve fully automated, operator-independent analysis. We are developing two novel, powerful, and automated algorithms that capitalize on these recent developments in machine learning. In Aim 1, we describe ‘NMRQuant’ for automated identification and quantification of annotated metabolites irrespective of the chemical shift, low SNR, and signal shape variability. In Aim 2, we describe ‘SPA-STOCSY’ for automated de-novo identification of molecular fragments of unknown, non- annotated metabolites. Based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to evaluate these algorithms' sensitivity, specificity, stability, and resistance to noise on phantom, biological, and clinical samples, comparing them to current methods. We will validate the accuracy of analyses by experimental 2D NMR, spike-in, and mass spectrometry. The proposed efforts will produce new NMR analytical software for discovery of both annotated and non-annotated metabolites, substantially improving accuracy and reproducibility of NMR analysis. Such analytical ability would change the existing paradigm of NMR-based metabolomics and provide an even stronger complement to current mass spectrometry-based methods.

"Integrating Biology into In Silico Methodologies: Modern approaches for incorporating biological reasoning and understanding into computational methods. 1 This proposal is for PA-18-648, NIH Support for Conferences and Scientific Meetings –  2 funding intended to help finance a two-day standalone “SOT CCT” workshop titled Integrating  3 Biology into In Silico Methodologies: Modern Approaches for incorporating biological  4 reasoning and understanding into computational methods. As a “Contemporary Concepts  5 in Toxicology” meeting, this workshop has the full backing, including being financially  6 underwritten, by the Society of Toxicology.  7 Computational modeling is an important tool for assessing the safety and use of  8 chemicals across many industries, including chemical, pharmaceutical, and consumer products.  9 Moreover, in silico methodologies offer academia and regulatory a fast and cheap method of 10 prioritizing its efforts to maintain compliance and safety in the market and environment. 11 This conference is designed to promote the development of actionable insights and 12 methodologies for increasing the biological relevance of in silico solutions. Specifically, this 13 conference will focus on solving the “black box effect”. There are many ways to validate a 14 model’s accuracy and domain – however if the model cannot explain what is happening 15 biologically, its use is severely diminished. This workshop will bring together regulatory, 16 academia, industry, and service providers to discuss current solutions and efforts, as well as 17 ongoing and future research. One goal of this conference will be to develop a roadmap for the 18 incorporation of AOPs (and similar biological reasonings) for computational tools. 19 This workshop has great appeal for multiple stakeholders within toxicology, namely 20 industry, academia, regulators, as well as service providers. The use of machine-learning to 21 replace laboratory toxicological tests is paramount to the future of the industry (3Rs). The use 22 of in silico models are explicitly referenced by NICEATM’s U.S. Strategic Roadmap, as well as 23 TSCA. Moreover, many industries and regulatory entities are taking significant steps away from 24 animal testing. Most recently, the US EPA stated that it will eliminate animal testing by 2035. 25 This workshop will bring together different stakeholders to discuss the current state of 26 AOPs and in silico methodologies, and to work towards a unified approach for their 27 incorporation. The final outcome of the workshop will be a white-paper that not only reviews the 28 current landscape but discusses concretes steps, as outlined in the breakout session, needed 29 for the regulatory acceptance of machine learning technologies – specifically a roadmap for the 30 inclusion of AOPs into computational tools and explanations.

"Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology Project Summary With the rise of high-throughput sequencing and multiplexed biotechnologies enabling single-cell multi-omics and massively parallel CRISPR experiments, the biomedical community is generating a monumental amount of data. These data promise to reveal new biology and drive personal and precision medicine. However, the sheer volume of genomic data is overwhelming current computational resources, requiring prohibitively high compute time, memory usage, and storage. My lab has been at the forefront of solving big data challenges in genomics, designing novel algorithms that enable efficient and secure analyses that were previously computationally infeasible, and that reveal novel structural, cellular, and systems biology. Drawing upon our expertise in developing scalable and insightful algorithms for analyzing genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, we aim to tackle two key data-driven challenges facing the biological community: 1) efficient, accurate, and robust characterization of tissues at the single-cell level, and 2) translating high-throughput datasets into biological discoveries via machine learning-based prediction. To solve the first challenge, we will leverage our discovery that seemingly high-dimensional sequencing data often lies on low-dimensional manifolds that capture the underlying biological state of interest. We will design algorithms that generate these compact, meaningful manifold representations of single-cell omics datasets. This will enable a number of key applications including characterizing co-expression and gene-modules that define healthy and pathologic cell states; integrating multi-modal single-cell omics datasets to more richly characterize cellular diversity; and investigating the mechanisms underlying transcriptomic diversity across tissues and developmental states. To solve the second challenge, we will take a two-pronged approach. First, we will design novel machine learning frameworks that provide a measure of confidence when predicting in unfamiliar biological states, enabling prediction that is robust to “out-of-distribution” (unobserved) examples. We will then work with our experimental collaborators and CROs to rapidly perform experimental validation of model-based predictions. Finally, we will return the experimental results to the model to further improve performance. This will enable an “active learning” feedback loop to efficiently explore a complex biological space for outcomes of interest. We will use this uncertainty-powered active learning approach to explore several pressing biological concerns such as the identification of small molecule compounds with enzymatic or whole-cell growth inhibitory properties, efficient design of spatial- transcriptomic experiments, computationally guided CRISPR perturbation experiments, and identification of functional non-coding mutations. This project will result in 1) numerous software tools with wide utility that efficiently analyze massive biological datasets and guide complex experimentation, and 2) reveal biological insights, especially into biomolecular interactions and cellular heterogeneity. Project Narrative The rise of high-throughput genomic profiling of individual cells and efficient, targeted manipulation of cellular phenotypes (including CRISPR-based genetic perturbations) promise to revolutionize our understanding of cellular biology and disease. However, realizing this revolution will require new computing paradigms that can integrate and analyze these massive datasets and suggest new biological hypotheses and experimental designs. Here we develop novel computational algorithms and software for tackling these challenges to characterize cellular diversity and improve our ability to manipulate cells to understand and treat disease.",Manifold representations and active learning for 21 st century biology,10207091,R35GM141861,"['Active Learning', 'Algorithm Design', 'Algorithmic Analysis', 'Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Biotechnology', 'Cells', 'Cellular biology', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computational algorithm', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Experimental Designs', 'Feedback', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genomics', 'Heterogeneity', 'High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing', 'Individual', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Memory', 'Modeling', 'Mutation', 'Outcome', 'Pathologic', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Property', 'Proteomics', 'Secure', 'Software Tools', 'Spatial Design', 'State Interests', 'Systems Biology', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Translating', 'Uncertainty', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Work', 'base', 'cell growth', 'computing resources', 'design', 'experimental study', 'genomic data', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'novel', 'precision medicine', 'small molecule', 'structural biology', 'transcriptomics']",NIGMS,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,R35,2021,478341
"An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology Hazardous pollutants in the environment continue to threaten public health and environmental  safety. Human exposure to major contaminant classes, such as polyfluorinated compounds  (PFCs), hazardous organic compounds (HOCs), and heavy metals, has been linked to a variety of  diseases and is subject to stringent State and Federal environmental regulations.  Bioremediation is a low-cost and environmentally friendly approach with many successful  use-cases; however, conventional bioremediation technologies can suffer from unreliability, low  degradation rates, and incomplete degradation. As stakeholders to Superfund sites and other sites  with water or soil pollution urgently demand more efficient, less costly and more reliable  remediation technologies, it is critical to look to advancements in computational  modeling to develop next-generation, precision-engineered bioremediation technologies. The proposed project builds on successful outcomes from Phase I in which a new computational  platform was designed and validated to accurately predict the bioremediation kinetics of  a multi-organism microcosm degrading a combination of HOCs in groundwater. The basis of  this platform is an approach called agent-based modeling (ABM), where the functions of  individual components (e.g. microorganisms) within complex ecosystems are used to predict and  optimize system-level properties (e.g. bioremediation kinetics). In this Phase II project, the novel computational platform developed in Phase I is  further improved with a machine learning component that leverages bioinformatics  databases to develop rationally tailored microbiomes for degrading complex pollutant  mixtures. Iterative experimental validation of model outputs is conducted using an innovative  materials science platform that maintains the relative concentration of different species in the  microbiome constant within the multi-zone treatment barrier (in-situ) or multi-zone bioreactor  (ex-situ). The project includes focused development of a prototype for one bioremediation use-case,  which is directly compared to a conventional (non-precision) bioremediation system treating   actual contaminated groundwater. This will be performed in order to assess and quantify  the expected technical and economic benefits of harnessing the project's novel computational  platform in biotechnology development. The broad, long-term impact of the proposed project will be to transform the development and  implementation of bioremediation by integrating advancements in computational modeling, machine  learning, bioinformatics, and materials science. By leveraging novel tools across disciplines, the  project will accelerate the development of more precise, reliable and inexpensive technologies for  environmental remediation. The successful outcome of the proposed project will also provide new  collaborative opportunities for industry and academia to more rapidly address the remediation of  high-priority pollutants in the environment, and ultimately help mitigate the effects of hazardous  pollutants on communities impacted by the presence of environmental contamination. PROJECT NARRATIVE Contaminated soils and waters continue to threaten public health and safety. This project builds on the development of a novel computational platform for predicting the complex, dynamic interactions between microbial ecosystems and hazardous contaminants-of-concern in the environment, and to utilize this information to develop improved engineered remediation biotechnologies.",An Agent-Based Modeling Platform for Environmental Biotechnology,10158243,R44ES026541,"['Academia', 'Address', 'Biodegradation', 'Bioinformatics', 'Bioreactors', 'Bioremediations', 'Biotechnology', 'Chemicals', 'Classification', 'Colorado', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computer Models', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Economics', 'Ecosystem', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'Environmental Monitoring', 'Environmental Pollution', 'Enzymes', 'Exposure to', 'Ginkgo biloba', 'Goals', 'Growth', 'Heavy Metals', 'In Situ', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Industry', 'Kinetics', 'Laboratories', 'Learning Module', 'Letters', 'Life', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Municipalities', 'Organism', 'Outcome', 'Output', 'Phase', 'Polymers', 'Process', 'Property', 'Public Health', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Safety', 'Side', 'Site', 'Soil', 'Structure', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Validation', 'Water', 'Water Pollution', 'base', 'computational platform', 'cost', 'design', 'economic evaluation', 'enzyme pathway', 'exposed human population', 'ground water', 'improved', 'innovation', 'laboratory experiment', 'materials science', 'microbial', 'microbiome', 'microorganism', 'next generation', 'novel', 'pollutant', 'prototype', 'remediation', 'research and development', 'soil pollution', 'success', 'superfund site', 'tool']",NIEHS,"MICROVI BIOTECH, INC.",R44,2021,630992
"Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis Summary/Abstract Continuing advances in nucleotide sequencing have resulted in the assembly of datasets containing large numbers of species, genes, and genomic segments. Phylogenomic analyses of these data are essential to progress in understanding evolutionary patterns across the tree of life, and are finding increasing numbers of applications in practical analyses that require understanding of how patterns change over time. The sheer size of phylogenomic datasets limits the practical utility of available methods due to excessive time and memory requirements. We have developed many high impact methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences, a tradition we propose to continue through this MIRA project by developing innovative methods that address new challenges in phylogenomics. We will focus on pattern-based approaches of machine learning with sparsity constraint (SL) applied to phylogenomics, as a complement to traditional model-based methods in molecular evolution and phylogenetics. In the proposed SL in Phylogenomics (SLiP) framework, we will build models that best explain the biological trait or evolutionary hypothesis of interest, with genomic loci, such as genes, proteins, and genomic segments, serving as model parameters. Preliminary results from two example applications establish the premise and promise of a general SLiP framework. In one, SLiP successfully detected loci whose inclusion in a phylogenomic dataset overtakes a consistent and contrasting signal from hundreds of other loci when inferring phylogenetic relationships. In the other example, SLiP revealed loci and biological functional categories that harbor convergent sequence evolutionary patterns associated with the emergence of the same trait in distinct evolutionary lineages. In all of these analyses, SLiP required only a small fraction of the computational time and memory demanded by traditional methods, and it enabled better evolutionary contrasts with fewer assumptions. Consequently, the successful development of SLiP will improve the feasibility, rigor, and reproducibility of large-scale data analysis. It will also democratize big data analytics via shortened analysis time and a relatively small memory footprint, and encourage the development of a new class of methods for phylogenomic analysis. This framework will be accessed from a free library of SLiP functions, which will be directly useable via command line and available in a graphical interface through integration with the MEGA software. Narrative The long-term goal of my research program is to develop methods and tools for comparative analysis of molecular sequences. In this project, we will develop a new class of phylogenomic methods based on sparse machine learning and benchmark their absolute and relative performance. New techniques and their software implementation will greatly facilitate data analyses that are vital for evolutionary and functional genomics.",Methods for Evolutionary Genomics Analysis,10086181,R35GM139540,"['Address', 'Benchmarking', 'Big Data Methods', 'Biological', 'Categories', 'Complement', 'Computer software', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Gene Proteins', 'Genes', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Libraries', 'Life', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Analysis', 'Molecular Evolution', 'Nucleotides', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phylogenetic Analysis', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Signal Transduction', 'Techniques', 'Time', 'Trees', 'base', 'comparative', 'functional genomics', 'genomic locus', 'graphical user interface', 'improved', 'innovation', 'interest', 'large scale data', 'programs', 'tool', 'trait']",NIGMS,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,R35,2021,396250
