"Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is distinctive amongst the inflammatory/autoimmune joint diseases in that its onset is commonly preceded by cutaneous psoriasis (PsC). This provides an unparalleled opportunity for the identification of predictive biomarkers to determine which of the approximately 25% of psoriasis vulgaris (PsV) patients will develop PsA. Over the past decade, we have expanded our genetic study of PsV to focus on PsA, resulting in the collection of 1,279 PsA patients at Michigan, 743 of whom have already been subjected to GWAS. Initiated in 2007, the International Psoriatic Arthritis Research Team (IPART) has accumulated 1,919 Canadian PsA patients, of whom 1,370 have already been subjected to GWAS. In 2015, we completed a meta- GWAS of PsC and PsA involving a discovery cohort of 1,430 PsA cases and 1,417 controls, with 9,293 additional PsV replication samples (3,061 PsA, 3,110 PsC) and 13,670 controls. We detected 10 associations for PsA and 11 for PsC, as well as a new association for PsV. Utilizing an innovative core exome array to genotype additional cases and controls, we carried out the largest meta-GWAS of PsV to date (~40,000 subjects) and found 16 more susceptibility regions, highlighting the roles of interferon signaling and the NFB cascade, and demonstrating strong enrichment for psoriasis genetic signals in T-cell regulatory elements. Using machine learning to model ~200 genetic variants in our PsA vs. PsC GWAS, we achieved 82% area under receiver operator curve for distinguishing PsA vs PsC, with 98% accuracy among the top 10% of patients with the highest genetic load. We also carried out RNA-seq on mRNA and miRNA from 65 pairs of pre- and post-conversion samples from PsC patients who developed PsA. Suggestive of a shift from skin- focused to systemic autoimmunity, we found significant post-conversion enrichment for central memory CD4+ T-cell (CD4-Tcm) transcripts among the up-regulated genes. We also observed highly correlated pre- and post- conversion behaviors of 54 differentially-expressed miRNAs and their mRNA targets, as well as multiple serum miRNAs that are significantly differentially expressed in PsA vs. PsC. A metabolomic study of 50 paired converter sera revealed 293 biochemicals with significant alterations, 275 of which were increased. Finally, we identified noncoding eQTLs for IL23R that correlate strikingly with a region of selective PsA association.  Based on these results, we hypothesize that PsA and PsC have pathogenetic mechanisms that are T-cell, osteoblast and osteoclast-driven and progress from skin to systemic during transition to PsA. We propose that this paradigm can be used to develop a useful test to predict PsA in PsC patients, while increasing our basic understanding of PsA. To test this hypothesis, we propose four aims: (1) to maintain and grow our longitudinal clinical resource; (2) To identify biomarkers for the development of PsA in PsC patients; (3) To integrate the biomarkers identified in Aim 2 into a clinically-useful tool for PsA identification using machine learning ; and (4) to explore the mechanisms by which the IL23R gene contributes to PsA pathogenesis. PROJECT NARRATIVE: Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is a major health problem in the United States and around the world. The mechanisms that predispose patients with psoriasis to develop PsA are unknown. The proposed research will utilize the power of genome-wide association studies, transcriptome analysis, metabolomics, and the largest longitudinal resource of PsA in the world to develop a clinically-relevant tool for PsA prediction and to address a major gap in our mechanistic understanding of the causes of PsA. The results of this research are also likely to be relevant to other autoimmune diseases.",Genetic and Genomic Dissection of Psoriatic Arthritis,10208711,R01AR063611,"['Address', 'Alleles', 'Area', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Autoimmune Process', 'Behavior', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Markers', 'Blood', 'Blood Banks', 'Blood specimen', 'CD8B1 gene', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cellular Assay', 'Chronic small plaque psoriasis', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Code', 'Collaborations', 'Collection', 'Cutaneous', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Dermatology', 'Dissection', 'Elements', 'Exhibits', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Load', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'HLA-C Antigens', 'Health', 'Hospitals', 'Immunity', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Interferons', 'International', 'Life', 'Longitudinal cohort', 'Machine Learning', 'Memory', 'Messenger RNA', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Michigan', 'MicroRNAs', 'Modeling', 'Mutagenesis', 'Osteoblasts', 'Osteoclasts', 'Pathogenesis', 'Patients', 'Predisposition', 'Proteins', 'Psoriasis', 'Psoriatic Arthritis', 'RNA', 'Regulatory Element', 'Regulatory T-Lymphocyte', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Rheumatology', 'Risk', 'Role', 'STAT3 gene', 'Sampling', 'Serum', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Skin', 'Small Interfering RNA', 'Suggestion', 'T-Lymphocyte', 'TNFSF15 gene', 'TYK2', 'Testing', 'Transcript', 'United States', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'arthropathies', 'base', 'biomarker development', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'comorbidity', 'differential expression', 'exome', 'follow-up', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'high risk', 'innovation', 'insight', 'memory CD4 T lymphocyte', 'metabolome', 'metabolomics', 'novel', 'osteoblast differentiation', 'predictive marker', 'rare variant', 'recruit', 'systemic autoimmunity', 'tool', 'tool development', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NIAMS,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,R01,2021,608486
"Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Genetic crosses in model organisms play an essential role in understanding how heritable factors affect medically relevant traits. Such crosses have traditionally tended to be on a small scale with limited power to detect genetic effects, limited ability to localize causal variants, and limited options for replication. In the last decade, however, the emergence of larger-scale interdisciplinary research, cheaper genotyping and parallel advances in human genetics, has spurred the development of more sophisticated and powerful experimental designs. Foremost are those that incorporate two modern genetic design concepts: the multiparental population (MPP), whereby each subject is descended from a small, well-characterized set of genetically diverse inbred strains, with the goal of efficiently exploring a wide genetic landscape; and the genetic reference population (GRP), whereby subjects are drawn from a large and genetically diverse set of inbred strains, with the goal that the study population, and thereby the studies themselves, can be infinitely replicated. Their combination, the multiparental genetic reference population (MP-GRP), represents the state-of-the-art in complex trait genetics and has been implemented in a number of model organisms, including plants, flies, and rodents.  The proposed program of research focuses on the development of statistical and computational tools to advance the design and analysis of studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs. It centers around addressing three interconnected questions.  1) How to take advantage of biological replicates in a genetically varying population? Directions considered include: more stable methods to detect genetically-induced phenotypic outliers; use of genetically-induced heteroskedasticity to improve statistical power and find variance-controlling genes; and more rigorous and expansive characterization of gene-by-treatment effects by using principles from causal inference.  2) How to navigate the complex design space of MP-GRPs and their derived crosses? Directions considered include: use of decision theory applied to Bayesian analysis of pilot data; incorporation of variance heterogeneity to control likely reproducibility.  3) How to approach quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in MPPs and MP-GRPs? Directions considered include: making haplotype-based association more robust to uncertainty in haplotype state; combining haplotype- based with variant-based mapping; adaptive modeling of QTL complexity; machine learning of the allelic series; familywise error rate control through descent-based permutation.  Progress on these fronts will not only fill significant gaps in studies using MPPs, GRPs and MP-GRPs, but will also provide tools and insights that will allow these designs to be used in new and more powerful ways. PROJECT NARRATIVE (RELEVANCE) The proposed research will lead to improvements in the analysis and design of genetic studies on experimental models of human disease. Because the project focuses on statistical methodology applied to experimental model organism populations (including mouse, rats and Drosophila) the scientific output of the project is expected to be applicable to basic research focusing on any medical condition that can be studied in model organisms.",Statistical Modeling of Multiparental and Genetic Reference Populations,10129203,R35GM127000,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Alleles', 'Animal Model', 'Basic Science', 'Bayesian Analysis', 'Biological', 'Complex', 'Complex Genetic Trait', 'Data', 'Decision Theory', 'Development', 'Drosophila genus', 'Experimental Designs', 'Experimental Models', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Crosses', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human Genetics', 'Inbred Strain', 'Interdisciplinary Study', 'Machine Learning', 'Medical', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Mus', 'Output', 'Phenotype', 'Plants', 'Play', 'Population', 'Population Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reproducibility', 'Research', 'Rodent', 'Role', 'Series', 'Statistical Models', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computerized tools', 'design', 'fly', 'human disease', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'programs', 'study population', 'tool', 'trait', 'treatment effect']",NIGMS,UNIV OF NORTH CAROLINA CHAPEL HILL,R35,2021,336445
"The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms Project Summary  Recent years have witnessed the development of large research projects that involve  genotyping hundreds of thousands of individuals, on which we have available detailed medical records. Examples include the All of us research project, the Million Veteran Program, and the UKBiobank resource. Often, whole-genome sequencing data is also available for a substantial fraction of the individuals. These large samples, with their precise genotypic and phenotypic information, give us the opportunity to bring our understanding of the relations between genetic variation and traits of medical interest to the next level.  While the initial small sample sizes available for genome wide association studies (GWAS) motivated analyses that were approximative in nature, we are now in the position to probe more closely the genetic causal mechanisms underlying medically relevant phenotypes. We can aspire to distinguish variants that have causal effects from those that are associated because of linkage disequilibrium or population structure. Indeed, we need to pay even greater attention to the implications of hidden confounders: even small effects become significant when sample sizes are large enough.  Increasing the resolution with which we can describe causal mechanisms will result in the identification of clearer targets for drug development. It will also improve the precision of  personalized risk evaluations based on genotypes: if we can construct risk scores using variants that are truly causal, their performance will remain solid across ethnicities and environmental exposures.  To zoom in on genetic variants with causal effects, this project will leverage a set of new statistical methodologies that the investigators have recently introduced. These new approaches are remarkably flexible, in that they do not rely on specific assumptions of how phenotypes are linked to genetic variants. Indeed, they allow researchers to capitalize on powerful machine learning algorithms and, crucially, equip their results with precise replicability guarantees.  We have assembled a diverse and complementary team, including experts in statistical  genomics, methodological statistics and computer science, with a strong record both of software development and genetic data analysis. A postdoctoral scholar and two graduate students will contribute to the research program, and the interdisciplinary training they will acquire in  statistics, computation and genetics will add another substantial benefit. Personalized medicine strives to provide treatments that are fine-tuned to the patients, aware both of the specificity of their diseases as well as of the individuals’ background characteristics. In order to achieve this promise, identifying those genes and mutations that influence the medically relevant traits is an important tool: it gives us the opportunity to understand the biological pathways involved, inspires drug development, informs treatment and counseling and facilitates prevention. The proposed research would develop new methods of statistical analysis to harness the information contained in large datasets, increasing our ability to distinguish the genetic mutations that directly impact phenotypes, from those that are merely correlated with traits of interest.",The pursuit of genetic causal mechanisms,10291186,R56HG010812,"['Algorithms', 'All of Us Research Program', 'Attention', 'Awareness', 'Biological', 'Characteristics', 'Chromatin', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Counseling', 'DNA Resequencing', 'DNA Sequence Alteration', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Dependence', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Drug Targeting', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Mutation', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Determinism', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Heterogeneity', 'Individual', 'Linear Models', 'Link', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Literature', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Medical', 'Medical Records', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Nature', 'Noise', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Prevention', 'Probability', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Research Project Grants', 'Resolution', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Scientist', 'Side', 'Solid', 'Specificity', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'base', 'causal variant', 'computer science', 'drug development', 'flexibility', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'graduate student', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'machine learning algorithm', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'personalized medicine', 'polygenic risk score', 'prediction algorithm', 'programs', 'rare variant', 'sex', 'software development', 'statistics', 'tool', 'trait', 'virtual', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,R56,2021,455280
"Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease Project Summary/Abstract Understanding and treating genome abnormalities that lead to rare genetic neurodegenerative diseases such as Niemann-Pick C1 globally managing cholesterol homeostasis, or APOE alleles impacting cholesterol homeostasis in the brain triggering late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD), present a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We have developed a Gaussian process regression (GPR) based machine learning (ML) approach that captures for the first time genomic variation in the population to understand the spatial covariance (SCV) relationships contributing to sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual. Genetic disease is fundamentally a problem of understanding the impact of altered folding intermediates found in response to variation in the protein fold and how they are managed by proteostasis. Proteostasis encompasses a broad range of chaperone and degradative components that manage the synthesis, folding/stability and function of the protein fold in response to inherited and environmental stress and aging. The general premise of this proposal is to develop a deep genome-based understanding of proteostasis that will teach us how to manage genetic diseases triggered by folding stress. The rationale for this proposal is that sparse genetic diversity found in the population, when used as a collective through application of GRP-ML defined SCV relationships, can provide us on a residue-by-residue basis insight into the folding intermediates that contribute to disease for the entire polypeptide sequence. The objective of this proposal is to understand the role of proteostasis in managing this genetic diversity for the benefit of therapeutic intervention. We hypothesize that management of the polypeptide fold of disease-causing variant proteins found in the population by targeting the function of the multivalent Hsp40 and Hsp70 co-chaperone/chaperone branch (the Hsp70 axis) of the proteostasis network will enable precision correction of misfolding phenotypes found in neurodegenerative disease. Our approach will study the impact of variation in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene. NPC1 is an inherited, autosomal recessive, disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and other lipids in late endosomal (LE) and lysosome (Ly) compartments of all cell types. The primary effect of NPC1 variation results in early onset neurodegenerative disease in response to loss of cholesterol homeostasis. In Aim 1 we will explore the ability of small molecules to allosterically regulate the activity of components of the Hsp70 axis to retune the synthesis, folding/stability, trafficking and/or function of NPC1 variants. In Aim 2 we will explore the molecular mechanism of action (MoA) of the Hsp70 axis components that are responsible for enabling NPC1 variant correction. Completion of both aims will generate a comprehensive assessment of the role of Hsp70 axis in NPC1 disease progression and will be used as a guide for advancement of a precision medicine approach to reduce or prevent the onset of neurodegenerative disease triggered by genomic variation in NPC1 population. Project Narrative Understanding the mechanism behind and treatment of genome abnormalities in the population that cause rare genetic disease in the individual represents a major challenge from both basic science and clinical perspectives. We will study the impact of genetic variation found in the Niemann Pick C1 (NPC1) gene, that, like APOE alleles driving late-onset Alzheimers disease (LOAD), is responsible for management of cholesterol homeostasis. We will use Gaussian process regression machine learning (GPR-ML) based spatial covariance (SCV) tools to define the mechanism of action of proteostasis components found in the Hsp70 axis to therapeutically manage the NPC1 fold leading to improved to cholesterol homeostasis in the individual to provide basic and clinical insight into disease management.",Using Genetic Diversity to Manage Neurological Disease,10100560,R01AG070209,"['Address', 'Aging', 'Alleles', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Amino Acid Sequence', 'Automobile Driving', 'Autophagocytosis', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biological Sciences', 'Birth', 'Brain', 'Buffers', 'Cells', 'Cessation of life', 'Characteristics', 'Chemicals', 'Cholesterol', 'Cholesterol Homeostasis', 'Clinical', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Etiology', 'GRP gene', 'Gaussian model', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Heat-Shock Proteins 70', 'Heat-Shock Response', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Inherited', 'Knowledge', 'Late Onset Alzheimer Disease', 'Lead', 'Learning', 'Light', 'Lipids', 'Lysosomes', 'Machine Learning', 'Modernization', 'Molecular', 'Molecular Chaperones', 'Molecular Mechanisms of Action', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Niemann-Pick Diseases', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Rare Diseases', 'Resolution', 'Role', 'Signal Pathway', 'Specificity', 'Stress', 'Structure', 'System', 'Target Populations', 'Therapeutic', 'Therapeutic Intervention', 'Time', 'Ubiquitin', 'Uncertainty', 'Variant', 'base', 'biochemical tools', 'biophysical tools', 'cell type', 'cholesterol control', 'druggable target', 'early onset', 'fitness', 'genomic variation', 'human model', 'improved', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'multicatalytic endopeptidase complex', 'nervous system disorder', 'novel', 'polypeptide', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'prognostic', 'protein folding', 'protein function', 'protein misfolding', 'proteostasis', 'rare genetic disorder', 'rare variant', 'response', 'small molecule', 'tool', 'trafficking']",NIA,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,443750
"Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity Project Summary Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated disease that destroys the protective myelin sheath surrounding nerve cells, and its cause is unknown. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, leading to the hypothesis that sun exposure, and consequently vitamin D exposure, has a protective effect on MS risk. Recent studies utilizing Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis have demonstrated strong evidence for a causal role of low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels in MS pathogenesis; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the association are unknown. It is well established that 25(OH)D signaling operates through the nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR), a ligand-regulated transcription factor. VDRs recognize specific binding sites in DNA, leading to activation or suppression of a target gene. Previous research has found that genetic variation of tagging SNPs (VDR-BVs) within these VDR binding sites, can alter binding affinity. These VDR-BVs are enriched in genomic regions associated with MS, as well as with several other autoimmune diseases, which suggests regulation of specific genes mediated by vitamin D could affect MS risk and severity. No formal investigation of genetic variation of individual VDR-BVs in MS cases and controls has been reported and VDR-BVs are strong candidates to investigate for genetic variation relevant to MS. The overall objective of this F31 application is to estimate the effect of VDR-BVs on MS risk and severity. We hypothesize that genetic variation in VDR-BVs is associated with MS susceptibility and severity, and further, that the effect of this genetic variation on MS is modulated by bioavailability of vitamin D. Our approach will use a dataset of approximately 10,000 clinically definite MS cases and 35,000 controls frequency matched on age and race/ethnicity with whole genome genotypes, demographic, clinical, and environmental exposure data and will: 1) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs near established MS risk loci and MS risk and severity; 2) Estimate the association between VDR-BVs across the human genome and MS risk and severity; and 3) Replicate findings in independent datasets of MS cases and controls and combine replicated associations across all datasets via meta-analysis. VDR-BVs were previously identified through ChIP-seq analysis in Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines and we will use machine learning to prioritize candidate VDR-BVs for Aim 2. Analyses will incorporate a genetic instrumental variable as measure of 25(OH)D bioavailability to test for interaction between VDR-BVs and 25(OH)D bioavailability. Results from the proposed aims will determine whether MS GWAS findings are partially explained by genetic variation in VDR binding affinity, identify genetic risk factors for MS related to vitamin D, and identify new genes and regulatory pathways involved in the development of MS. Ultimately, the goal of this work understand the mechanisms by which vitamin D affects this immune- mediated neurological disorder. Project Narrative Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that results in significant disability and decreased quality of life with both genetic and environmental risk factors. MS prevalence is higher in regions farther from the equator, and recent research has demonstrated evidence supporting a causal role for low vitamin D in MS risk and disease severity. The objective of this F31 fellowship application is to identify and characterize vitamin D binding sites that are associated with susceptibility to MS and disease severity.",Establishing the Role of Genetic Variation in Vitamin D Regulated Gene Expression in MS Pathogenesis and Severity,10145491,F31NS113537,"['25-hydroxyvitamin D', 'Affect', 'Affinity', 'Autoimmune Diseases', 'Binding', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Availability', 'California', 'ChIP-seq', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Fellowship', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human Genome', 'Immune', 'Investigation', 'Ligands', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mediating', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Mission', 'Molecular', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Myelin Sheath', 'National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke', 'Neurons', 'Nuclear', 'Outcome', 'Pathogenesis', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Publishing', 'Quality of life', 'Race', 'Regulation', 'Regulatory Pathway', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Serum', 'Severities', 'Severity of illness', 'Signal Transduction', 'Study Subject', 'Sun Exposure', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Vitamin D', 'Vitamin D supplementation', 'Vitamin D3 Receptor', 'Work', 'burden of illness', 'case control', 'cohort', 'disability', 'epidemiology study', 'evidence base', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'individual variation', 'interdisciplinary approach', 'lymphoblastoid cell line', 'multiple datasets', 'nervous system disorder', 'pediatric multiple sclerosis', 'programs', 'protective effect', 'receptor binding', 'risk variant', 'transcription factor', 'whole genome']",NINDS,UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY,F31,2021,42076
"An Integrative Radiogenomic Approach to Design Genetically-Informed Image Biomarker for Characterizing COPD ! Abstract  Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide with a devastating socio-economic burden impacting more than three million individuals per year in the US. The primary environmental risk factor in the susceptible population is smoking, which causes an exaggerated inflammatory response. However, many factors including several genetic risk variants substantially influence the susceptibility. Twin-based studies show that families with emphysema have a higher risk for the disease. The two different major phenotypes of COPD are small airway remodeling (airway disease) and alveolar destruction (emphysema). Although these two major phenotypes result in a similar deficiency in global lung function, the relationship between them is complicated and likely involves feedback mechanisms. Developing an objective method to characterize lung phenotypes is critical since treatment candidates vary based on phenotype. Measurements from High-Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT) images are increasingly used to describe COPD since they can quantitatively describe the contribution of the phenotypes. To discover the genetic risk variants, Genome-Association Studies (GWAS) have focused on either the physiological lung function or a simple threshold-based measurement from lung CT, neither of which fully characterizes phenotypic subtypes or the distribution pattern of disease. The proposed studies will take advantage of the rich image and genetic data jointly to build a genetically-informed imaging biomarker to characterize each patient. For each patient, our method summarizes the CT image to a vector representation that accurately describes the severity of the disease. Also, a method to link the representation back to the genetic risk variants will be developed. If successful, these methods can be used to monitor the efficacy of treatment or progression of the disease using imaging data. Successful execution of the second aim will result in better understanding of the etiology of different disease subtypes and discovery of novel genetic pathways that could be used as potential drug targets. Furthermore, the patient representation enables the use of image data to construct a more powerful model to predict the so-called acute exacerbation event. Predicting the exacerbations is clinically important since they cause further damage to the lung.  In Aim 1, we develop and implement a novel image biomarker that is mutually informed by imaging and genetic data from each patient. Our statistical method in Aim 2 elucidates the underlying genetic pathways behind the abnormal anatomical variations explained by the biomarker. We validate our method on data from 10,300 patients in the COPDGene dataset. !

"Single cell atlas as a roadmap for interpreting human genetic variation in complex disease Project Summary Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified thousands of loci likely affecting human health. To translate these findings into therapeutic targets and disease treatments, we need to understand the cellular context and underlying biological mechanisms through which each disease associated variant disrupts function. Large scale, information rich datasets are being generated across multiple modalities including transcriptomics from single cell RNA-seq studies, traits and phenotypes from the UK Biobank and germline genetic variation from exome sequencing studies. Here, we propose to develop methods to integrate these amazing resources towards understanding the identifying biological and cellular mechanisms that are leading to disease. The objectives will be accomplished with the following specific aims: 1) Integrate population scale biological datasets including UK Biobank and single cell transcriptomics data to construct gene modules with the goal to recapitulate biological pathways. 2) Develop a statistical framework to measure mutational burden across each of the cell type specific gene modules. Together, this research proposal will increase the power in interpreting human genetic variation and help better understand the mechanism through which they act. These methods are being developed around an IBD dataset and will derive substantial molecular information about the mechanisms driving IBD. The lessons and methodological advances from this work will be directly applicable in many complex disease contexts. Project Narrative Genome wide association studies are highly successful identifying thousands of disease-associated loci but fall short at 1) pinpointing the biological mechanisms through which the variants effect disease and 2) capturing the effects of rare variants which may be having larger effect on disease outcomes. This research proposal details plans to integrate high-throughput single cell transcriptomics, population scale biobank datasets and exome sequencing from large disease cohorts to learn a prior on which genes are likely working together in which cell types and consequently improve the statistical power in interpreting rare human genetic variation.

"From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms The current forward genetics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified ~300 distinct loci regulating blood pressure (BP), primarily implicating sequence variation within the non-coding genome. However, for precision medicine of hypertension (HTN), a major challenge for public health, mechanistic identification of the genomic components altering the expression of BP genes is required. To solve this important bottleneck, we use a functional genomics inspired reverse genetics strategy to identify the transcription factors (TF), cis-regulatory elements (CRE), DNA variants and BP genes in four BP relevant tissues. Taking advantage of the analytical expertise and collaborations within the Family Blood Pressure Program Essential Hypertension GWAS consortium (FEHGAS3), and newly developed experimental and computational tools, we propose a novel framework for discovering the functional genetic modules, at identified BP loci and genome-wide, affecting inter-individual BP variation. Our approach enables answers to long-standing questions in BP genomics and physiology, with lessons for understanding many other complex diseases. We propose three major aims: (1) Identifying the transcription factors (TF), enhancers (CRE) and expressed genes in BP-relevant tissues; (2) Connecting enhancer (CRE) variation to gene expression and BP variation; and, (3) Identifying causal mechanisms that modulate BP to provide translational insights. The major hypothesis explaining the results of blood pressure (BP) genome-wide association studies (GWAS) is that sequence variants at specific cis-regulatory elements (CRE or enhancer) affect the binding of their cognate transcription factors (TF) to alter expression of specific BP genes. In this second renewal of the FEHGAS consortium, we propose new computational and experimental approaches to identify the TFs, CREs, and target genes, active in four blood pressure target tissues, so that the effects of causal BP affecting genetic variation can be tested, within identified BP loci and genome-wide. This tissue-based view provides an alternative, complementary approach for understanding how BP variation leads to primary hypertension and hypertensive target organ damage, a major public health challenge.","From GWAS loci to blood pressure genes, variants & mechanisms",10101662,R01HL086694,"['ATAC-seq', 'Adrenal Glands', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Base Pairing', 'Binding', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cell Line', 'Cells', 'Chromatin', 'Collaborations', 'Complex', 'DNA', 'DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Enhancers', 'Essential Hypertension', 'Family', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Frequency', 'Gene Targeting', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Screening', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Heart', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Joints', 'Kidney', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Minor', 'National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute', 'Organ', 'Physiologic pulse', 'Physiology', 'Public Health', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporter', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smooth Muscle Myocytes', 'Structure', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Trans-Omics for Precision Medicine', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vascular Endothelium', 'base', 'biobank', 'blood pressure medication', 'blood pressure regulation', 'cell type', 'computerized tools', 'epigenomics', 'forward genetics', 'functional genomics', 'genetic approach', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic data', 'insight', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'pressure', 'programs', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'receptor', 'reverse genetics', 'statistics', 'support vector machine', 'trait', 'transcription factor', 'transcriptome sequencing']",NHLBI,NEW YORK UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE,R01,2021,564082
"Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), is an NHGRI Center of Excellence in ELSI Research (CEER) that, in its first four years, established an environment for multi-disciplinary study that produced innovative ways of studying genetic privacy and identity. Specifically, the center 1) parsed the concept of genetic privacy into its often conflated constituent components, including: the “right to be let alone,” control and governance of data, and concerns about downstream uses of data; 2) documented and critically assessed the privacy practices of direct to consumer genetic testing (DTC-GT) companies; 3) examined how and why people trade off personal privacy for other social goods and services; 4) used new techniques to explore how film, television, and social media reflect and affect public perceptions of genetic privacy; and 5) refined understanding of the risk that people will be re-identified from their genomic information. During this time, many developments raised new issues of privacy and identity for genetics. First is the growth of DTC-GT, which generates genetic information used to trace ancestry, acquire health information, find relatives, uncover parentage, and pursue law enforcement investigations, among other activities. Second, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security, particularly with respect to genomics, are changing rapidly in the U.S. and abroad. These often conflict and present new challenges as genomic data move across state and international borders. Third, the creation of ever larger cohorts, such as the NIH’s All of Us Research Program, raises further dilemmas because some or all of the genomic and other data participants provide will be made available to investigators working in a variety of settings and subject to different regulatory regimes. Moreover, participants in these studies may receive research results, which could be deposited in their electronic health records, making this data subject to clinical regulation and compelling action by clinical providers who may not have the knowledge or infrastructure to respond. Thus, as our understanding of genomics increases, so, too, do its multifarious roles and implications for individuals, families, and society evolve. Given the evolving landscape, in its next four years GetPreCiSe will address three complementary specific aims: 1) Apply multimodal methods to characterize how social practices affect, and are affected by, evolving notions of genetic privacy and identity and increased availability of data, 2) Characterize how emerging legal and regulatory frameworks influence genomic privacy and identity in the US and abroad, and 3) Engineer and evaluate new technologies and quantitative frameworks that have potential to intrude on, but also protect, genetic privacy and identity. Recognizing that genetic data processing opportunities and threats are evolving, GetPreCiSe is designed to be a multi-disciplinary center, focused on training the next generation of ELSI researchers, with sufficient agility to respond to emerging issues. We anticipate these aims will need to be refined, and possibly pivoted, over the next four years and so stand ready to seed new investigations into emerging issues and compose new teams for investigation as needed. The incorporation of genetics and genomics into medical care and the public domain raises new challenges for how we understand privacy and identity, concepts that have long been closely linked in American discourse. The Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings (GetPreCiSe), an NHGRI Center of Excellence in Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications Research (CEER) will 1) characterize how social practices and genetic data access affect notions of genetic privacy and identity, 2) assess the impact of emerging laws and regulatory frameworks in the US and abroad, and 3) gauge how new technologies compromise but also uphold protections.",Genetic Privacy and Identity in Community Settings - GetPreCiSe,10256016,RM1HG009034,"['Address', 'Advertising', 'Affect', 'Age', 'All of Us Research Program', 'American', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Arts', 'Behavior', 'Big Data', 'CCL4 gene', 'California', 'Caring', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Communities', 'Conceptions', 'Conflict (Psychology)', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Protection', 'Data Security', 'Deposition', 'Development', 'Electronic Health Record', 'Engineering', 'Environment', 'European Union', 'Family', 'Film', 'Gender', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Identity', 'Genetic Models', 'Genetic Privacy', 'Genetic study', 'Genomics', 'Growth', 'Health', 'Imagination', 'Individual', 'Infrastructure', 'International', 'Internet', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Law Enforcement', 'Laws', 'Legal', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Medical', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'National Human Genome Research Institute', 'Newspapers', 'Participant', 'Perception', 'Policies', 'Privacy', 'Provider', 'Public Domains', 'Publications', 'Race', 'Radio', 'Regulation', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Seeds', 'Services', 'Social Network', 'Social Sciences', 'Societies', 'Technology', 'Television', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Training', 'United States', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Use of New Techniques', 'Visual', 'Work', 'base', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral economics', 'blockchain', 'cohort', 'community setting', 'computerized data processing', 'data access', 'data privacy', 'data sharing', 'design', 'ethical legal social implication', 'genetic information', 'genetic testing', 'genomic data', 'innovation', 'insight', 'interest', 'legal implication', 'minimal risk', 'multidisciplinary', 'multimodality', 'new technology', 'news', 'next generation', 'sex', 'social', 'social media']",NHGRI,VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER,RM1,2021,1051733
"Statistical Methods in Trans-Omics Chronic Disease Research Project Summary The broad, long-term objectives of this research are the development of novel and high-impact statistical methods for medical studies of chronic diseases, with a focus on trans-omics precision medicine research. The speciﬁc aims of this competing renewal application include: (1) derivation of efﬁcient and robust statistics for integrative association analysis of multiple omics platforms (DNA sequences, RNA expressions, methylation proﬁles, protein expressions, metabolomics proﬁles, etc.) with arbitrary patterns of missing data and with detection limits for quantitative measurements; (2) exploration of statistical learning approaches for handling multiple types of high- dimensional omics variables with structural associations and with substantial missing data; and (3) construction of a multivariate regression model of the effects of somatic mutations on gene expressions in cancer tumors for discovery of subject-speciﬁc driver mutations, leveraging gene interaction network information and accounting for inter-tumor heterogeneity in mutational effects. All these aims have been motivated by the investigators' applied research experience in trans-omics studies of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The proposed solutions are based on likelihood and other sound statistical principles. The theoretical properties of the new statistical methods will be rigorously investigated through innovative use of advanced mathematical arguments. Computationally efﬁcient and numerically stable algorithms will be developed to implement the inference procedures. The new methods will be evaluated extensively with simulation studies that mimic real data and applied to several ongoing trans-omics precision medicine projects, most of which are carried out at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Their scientiﬁc merit and computational feasibility are demonstrated by preliminary simulation results and real examples. Efﬁcient, reliable, and user-friendly open-source software with detailed documentation will be produced and disseminated to the broad scientiﬁc community. The proposed work will advance the ﬁeld of statistical genomics and facilitate trans-omics precision medicine studies of chronic diseases.

"Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling Project Summary/Abstract Therapeutic management of lung disorders hallmarked by the loss-of-function of the Cystic Fibrosis (CF) Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR) leading to CF are challenged by genetic and epigenetic diversity found in the CF population. Given the Precision Medicine Initiative (All of Us for You (https://allofus.nih.gov/) and the large amount of genomic and phenomic diversity found in patients, it is now generally recognized that we must find new approaches to address the complexity in CF presentation in the clinic. This will require an understanding of fundamental principles dictating disease onset at birth, defined by familial genetic variation, and its progression, influenced by epigenetic programs, both unique to the individual. This proposal is about understanding the role of genetic and epigenetic diversity in CF in response to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity. We have shown these relationships to be responsive to the activity of HDACs, proteins that manage the acetylation/deacetylation balance of the genome and the proteome (the epigenome) to integrate the complex functions linking the genome to the proteome and phenome. Based on the premise that the genome and epigenome are sensitive to manipulation(s) that will favor increased functionality of the CFTR variant fold, the objective of this proposal is to mechanistically define the impact of HDAC modulation on CFTR function observed at the bench and the bedside. We hypothesize that CF can be best understood based on the rationale that disease can be defined by the collective of variation found in the CF population that alters CFTR sequence-to-function-to-structure relationships in the individual as now described using Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and the new principle of Spatial CoVariance (SCV) (Wang and Balch, 2018, In press). It is the objective of this proposal to apply VSP/SCV to analysis of the role of the epigenome in CF. Key goals to be achieved in this proposal are to 1) define molecular, cellular and physiological states that 2) describe the role of genetic/epigenetic/proteomic diversity in the CF population to 3) provide a sequence-to-function-to-structure characterization of disease in the individual. Aim 1 will explore the impact of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) to define, from a biochemical/genetic diversity perspective, how variation across the entire CF population will respond to rebalancing of acetylation/deacetylation dynamics. Aim 2 will focus on the role of HDAC7 in the management of CF genetic diversity using molecular, biochemical and cellular approaches. Aim 3 will analyze the role of select HDAC7-sensitive CFTR interactors to address their role in the management of CF variation from an epigenetic perspective. We hypothesize that the completion of these Aims will describe relationships in the population that define the epigenome-linked genome features that impact progression of CF in the individual. Our integrated genome/epigenome/proteome platform will advance our understanding of the contribution of genetic diversity in the progression and management of CF as a complex disease. Project Narrative CF is a complex loss-of-function disease caused by genetic and epigenetic variation in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator (CFTR). We will focus on understanding spatial relationships defined by genetic diversity across the CF population that are sensitive to Histone DeACetylase (HDAC) activity to understand the role of the acetylation/deacetylation balance in facilitating function in the individual. We will use a combination of genomic/epigenomic/proteomic approaches based on the principles of Variation Spatial Profiling (VSP) and Spatial CoVariance (SCV) to dissect the role of HDAC in integrated pathways that affect CFTR variant synthesis, folding, trafficking and stability/function at the cell surface that may be responsive to chemical and/or biological manipulation of the epigenome.",Modulation of Lung Disease by Genetic/Epigenetic Profiling,10134401,R01HL095524,"['Acetylation', 'Address', 'Affect', 'Amino Acids', 'Automobile Driving', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Genetics', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Birth', 'Cell Death', 'Cell surface', 'Cells', 'Chemicals', 'Clinic', 'Clinical', 'Collection', 'Complex', 'Cystic Fibrosis', 'Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator', 'Deacetylation', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Equilibrium', 'Fibrosis', 'Funding', 'Gaussian model', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'HDAC7 histone deacetylase', 'Health', 'Histone Deacetylase', 'Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor', 'Human', 'Immune', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory Response', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Lung diseases', 'Machine Learning', 'Membrane', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Modification', 'Molecular', 'Mucous body substance', 'Onset of illness', 'Pathology', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Physiology', 'Population', 'Precision Medicine Initiative', 'Process', 'Proteins', 'Proteome', 'Proteomics', 'Publications', 'Role', 'Structure', 'System', 'Therapeutic', 'Tissues', 'Variant', 'base', 'bench to bedside', 'cystic fibrosis patients', 'epigenetic profiling', 'epigenetic variation', 'epigenome', 'epigenomics', 'genomic platform', 'healthspan', 'insight', 'loss of function', 'novel strategies', 'phenome', 'phenomics', 'programs', 'response', 'spatial relationship', 'success', 'trafficking', 'transcription factor']",NHLBI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,483750
"Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores PROJECT SUMMARY The key appeal of polygenic risk scores (PRS) is the provision of individual-level estimates of genetic liability to complex disease. These proxies of genetic liability enable a raft of applications across clinical and basic research settings. However, while PRS are set to play a pivotal role in the future of biomedical research, their present formulation is suboptimal since it fails to directly account for substructure in genetic disease risk. The overarching goal of our proposal is to introduce a new generation of pathway-specific PRS, informed by biological function. Rather a single genome-wide PRS for each individual, they will have a set of k PRS over k pathways. Pathways will be defined according to multiscale integration of ‘omics data, exploiting co-expression networks, the transcriptome and the epigenome. The key deliverable from this project will be the production of a powerful and comprehensive pathway-specific PRS computational tool, PRSet, informed by biological function. The rationale is that PRS calculated for individuals by aggregating the effects of all risk variants genome-wide, results in a loss of vital individual-level information. Providing pathway-specific estimates of genetic liability, computed in a scalable, statistically rigorous way, informed by latest multi-omic data, could enable researchers to better decompose heterogenous complex disease, identify key pathways that explain overlap or differences among disorders, and explain problems of portability of PRS between and within populations. Applying our pathway-specific PRS tool, we seek to stratify patients into more homogenous subgroups by their liability over key pathways. We will use PRSet for stratification in three ways: (i) stratifying within SCZ/BiP, testing if liability over different pathways forms multiple routes to disease, (ii) differentiating between SCZ and BiP, testing if key pathways differentiate these highly overlapping disorders, (iii) testing whether variation in treatment response can be explained by pathway liability. Such stratification could help explain past successes, failures and adverse-effects in clinical trials, and provide new therapeutic targets tailored to subsets of patients. Our proposal is significant because the burgeoning application of PRS means that any advance in the PRS approach will have immediate, high impact across psychiatric research. Pathway-specific PRS could open-up routes to hypotheses that cannot be answered by genome-wide PRS. If PRSet reveals that genetic liability is more stratified than presently modelled, then this would call for a focus on pathways and their multi-omic integration, paving a new path towards precision medicine. Our proposal is innovative because we develop the first pathway-specific, function-informed, PRS tool, we propose that disease risk may be influenced by multiple genetic liabilities, and we stratify patients according to pathway-specific genetic risk for the first time. In conclusion, our proposal delivers a tool for the field to perform powerful pathway PRS analyses, better understand genetic liability to disease, and which may offer a more direct route to precision medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are set to play a key role in advancing our understanding of the etiology and treatment of disease. While the application of genome-wide PRS is burgeoning across biomedical research, we propose that pathway-specific PRS have even greater potential to provide etiological insights and will help pave the way to precision medicine. Here we introduce a new generation of pathway-specific polygenic risk scores, informed by biological function, and deliver a comprehensive computational tool for their analysis, applying it to perform patient stratification in schizophrenia and bipolar disorders.","Next-generation, pathway-specific, polygenic risk scores",10136725,R01MH122866,"['Address', 'Adverse effects', 'Basic Science', 'Biochemical', 'Biochemical Pathway', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Biomedical Research', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Body mass index', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Research', 'Clinical Trials', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Custom', 'Data', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Disease susceptibility', 'Environment', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Etiology', 'Failure', 'Formulation', 'Future', 'Generations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Gold', 'Human', 'In Vitro', 'Individual', 'Intuition', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Location', 'Mental disorders', 'Modeling', 'Multiomic Data', 'Pathway interactions', 'Phenotype', 'Play', 'Population', 'Prevention', 'Production', 'Proxy', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Route', 'Running', 'Sampling', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stratification', 'Subgroup', 'Symptoms', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Variant', 'base', 'computerized tools', 'disorder risk', 'epigenome', 'functional genomics', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'high risk', 'individualized prevention', 'innovation', 'insight', 'multiple omics', 'new therapeutic target', 'next generation', 'novel strategies', 'patient stratification', 'patient subsets', 'personalized medicine', 'personalized therapeutic', 'polygenic risk score', 'portability', 'precision medicine', 'prototype', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'statistical and machine learning', 'success', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'treatment response', 'user-friendly']",NIMH,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,635256
"Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes PROJECT SUMMARY This is an application by an early stage investigator who has the long-term objective of studying determinants of racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease. Risk variants in the Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) gene on chromosome 22 are common in persons of African ancestry (African Americans and Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) and are one of the most powerful disease variants identified to date in terms of frequency and effect size. This is an important discovery for kidney disease and has furthered our understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. There are efforts underway to incorporate APOL1 genetic testing in clinical settings including in pre-transplant evaluation and targeted therapies are on the horizon. However, the presence of two risk variants (i.e. the APOL1 high-risk genotypes, seen in up to 14% of African Americans and 4% of Afro-Caribbean Hispanic Americans) does not lead to overt kidney disease in all individuals. This incomplete penetrance indicates a major role of either genetic or environmental modifiers i.e. ‘second hits’. Although some genetic modifiers have been discovered, previous studies have been hampered by lack of sample sizes due to underrepresentation of minorities. There are also strong associations between air pollution, adverse neighborhood environment (including walkability and poverty) and podocyte toxic heavy metals (Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury) with kidney disease and racial/ethnic minorities are disproportionately exposed to these environmental risk factors. We propose a robust research strategy leveraging several large datasets/cohorts to comprehensively investigate the genetic and environmental ‘second-hits’ for the APOL1- kidney disease association through the following Specific Aims: : To identify and replicate SNPs that modify the association of the APOL1 high-risk genotypes with kidney disease (Aim 1). Using genetic and clinical data on ~70,000 minority individuals (~5,400 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes), we will investigate SNPs modifying the association between APOL1 high-risk genotype and kidney disease. We will then perform replication of the top performing hits in ~25,000 independent individuals (~5,000 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). We will then assess the interaction of air pollution (particulate matter<2.5 µg or PM2.5) and adverse measures of neighborhood walkability/poverty with APOL1 high-risk for kidney disease (Aim 2) using geographically diverse studies: BioMe Biobank; Jackson Heart Study and REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) in ~40,000 individuals (~3,600 with APOL1 high-risk genotypes). Finally, we will explore the interaction between urine levels of Arsenic, Cadmium and Mercury with APOL1 high-risk genotypes for kidney disease in a case-control study from REGARDS (n=2,332) and in exploratory analyses assess whether soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) levels-an inflammatory APOL1 modifier-affects this interaction (Aim 3). This proposal will lead to critical insights on genetic and environmental ‘second hits’ for APOL1 and improved understanding of racial/ethnic disparities in kidney disease. PROJECT NARRATIVE. Mutations in a specific gene (Apolipoprotein L1 or APOL1) seen only in people of African ancestry (African Americans or Hispanic Americans) is linked to high rates of kidney disease, with only some of the individuals with these mutations developing kidney disease, indicating that other genetic or environmental factors are involved. We will explore these factors including other genes and common environmental exposures like air pollution/neighborhood environment, and heavy metal exposure. We will understand what additional risk factors contribute to kidney disease in individuals with this mutation, which will lead to preventative efforts to address the persistent racial and ethnic disparities in kidney disease.",Elucidating Genetic and Environmental Second Hits in Racial and Ethnic Minorities with APOL1 High-Risk Genotypes,10100412,R01DK127139,"['Address', 'Affect', 'African', 'African American', 'Air Pollution', 'Apolipoproteins', 'Arsenic', 'Biological Assay', 'Cadmium', 'Caribbean Hispanic', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Chromosome 22', 'Chronic Kidney Failure', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Data', 'Disease', 'Disease Outcome', 'Early treatment', 'End stage renal failure', 'Ensure', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Evaluation', 'Exposure to', 'Face', 'Frequencies', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Geographic state', 'Geography', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'HIV', 'Heavy Metals', 'Hispanic Americans', 'Individual', 'Inflammatory', 'Investigation', 'Jackson Heart Study', 'Kidney', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mercury', 'Metabolic', 'Metal exposure', 'Metals', 'Methods', 'Minority', 'Minority Groups', 'Modification', 'Mutation', 'Neighborhoods', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Particulate Matter', 'Patients', 'Penetrance', 'Persons', 'Positioning Attribute', 'Poverty', 'Preventive', 'Reasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Time', 'Transplantation', 'Underrepresented Minority', 'Urine', 'Urokinase Plasminogen Activator Receptor', 'Variant', 'biobank', 'career development', 'case control', 'cell type', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'deprivation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'ethnic minority population', 'experience', 'fine particles', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'high risk', 'improved', 'inflammatory marker', 'innovation', 'insight', 'large datasets', 'minority communities', 'multidisciplinary', 'nephrotoxicity', 'non-genetic', 'novel', 'podocyte', 'racial and ethnic', 'racial and ethnic disparities', 'racial minority', 'risk stratification', 'risk variant', 'socioeconomics', 'targeted treatment', 'urinary', 'walkability']",NIDDK,ICAHN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT MOUNT SINAI,R01,2021,775497
"Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia Project Summary Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now ~270 loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. As observed for other complex psychiatric disorders, the identified regions are overwhelmingly noncoding, strongly suggesting that genetic variation in gene regulatory elements is a major mechanistic contributor. Further investigation of those regulatory mechanisms is precluded by a fundamental gap in the ability to identify, characterize, and quantify brain-relevant regulatory elements, and limited understanding of how genetic variation within those elements influences their function. To address this knowledge gap, this project will comprehensively identify, characterize, quantify, and validate noncoding functional noncoding regulatory elements and variants in neuronal cells. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that noncoding variation contributes to psychiatric disorders by directly altering the function of regulatory elements in the brain. The motivation for the proposed study is that identifying regulatory mechanisms of psychiatric disorders has the potential to translate into improved diagnosis and treatment. Powered by a team with strong interdisciplinary expertise in psychiatric disorders, functional genomics, technology development, and statistical genetics, this hypothesis will be tested by completing three specific aims: 1) Comprehensive integration of diverse data types to generate hypotheses that “connect” psychiatric genetic results to specific genes; 2) perform high-throughput CRISPR epigenome editing screens to test Aim 1 hypotheses in a natural biological context; 3) Develop mechanistic understanding and validate functional noncoding SCZ risk variants using TF binding assays and iPS-derived neurons from SCZ cases with high genetic risk scores. Our approach is innovative because it uses a highly complementary and diverse set of experimental approaches to drive targeted genetic and functional investigation into regulatory mechanisms relevant for SCZ. In doing so, the proposed research provides a much-needed path forward to understand how noncoding variation contributes to complex human phenotypes. Project Narrative / Relevance Genetic research for psychiatric disorders has achieved remarkable advances in narrowing down regions of the genome that increase risk. However, the exact mechanism for why certain individuals are at higher risk than others remains unknown. The goal of this grant is to identify, characterize, and validate functional noncoding mutations that contribute to schizophrenia. Understanding how specific DNA variants directly contribute to psychiatric disorders will be critical for developing improved diagnostics and treatment therapies.",Beyond GWAS: High Throughput Functional Genomics & Epigenome Editing to Elucidate the Effects of Genetic Associations for Schizophrenia,10115982,R01MH125236,"['3-Dimensional', 'ATAC-seq', 'Address', 'Alleles', 'Awareness', 'Binding', 'Binding Proteins', 'Binding Sites', 'Biological', 'Biological Assay', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Nucleus', 'Cells', 'ChIP-seq', 'Chromatin', 'Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats', 'Complex', 'Consensus', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Elements', 'Enhancers', 'Epigenetic Process', 'Exons', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Haplotypes', 'Heritability', 'Hi-C', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons', 'Intervention', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mental disorders', 'Motivation', 'Mutation', 'Neurons', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Organoids', 'Pathway interactions', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmacology', 'Phenotype', 'Proteomics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Regulator Genes', 'Regulatory Element', 'Repression', 'Research', 'Risk', 'Schizophrenia', 'Science', 'Solid', 'Sweden', 'Synapses', 'Tail', 'Testing', 'Therapeutic', 'Translating', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Update', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Work', 'autism spectrum disorder', 'brain volume', 'cell type', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'epigenome', 'epigenome editing', 'excitatory neuron', 'exome sequencing', 'follow-up', 'functional genomics', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic association', 'genome editing', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'high risk', 'histone modification', 'improved', 'induced pluripotent stem cell', 'innovation', 'insight', 'mind control', 'mouse model', 'nerve stem cell', 'promoter', 'protein protein interaction', 'psychiatric genomics', 'psychogenetics', 'risk variant', 'screening', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'technology development', 'trait', 'transcription factor']",NIMH,DUKE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,1653935
"Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites Abstract/Summary Globally, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) outrank infectious diseases in terms of public health burden. Cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death worldwide. In this application we will explore the genomic risk for common CMD, including hypertension, stroke, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia and kidney disease, and related traits (including BMI, blood pressure, lipid, glucose, insulin and creatine) across populations with African ancestry (AA). There is evidence to suggest that polygenic risk scores (PRSs) translate poorly from a discovery study in one ancestral population (e.g. European Americans) to a target population (e.g. sub-Saharan Africans), especially when they are separated by large genetic differences. However, this has not been evaluated with large, well-powered AA datasets. Furthermore, the high genetic diversity and population structure among non-European Ancestry (EA) populations need to be investigated to understand the performance of PRSs in other regions populated by people with diverse genomic backgrounds. We bring together the Human Heredity and Health in Africa Consortium (H3Africa), other African, Jamaican and African American core cohorts, to develop a joint resource of over 50,000 participants with relevant phenotype and genomics data, referred to as the CARdiometabolic Disorders IN African-ancestry PopuLations (CARDINAL) Study Site. In addition, the CARDINAL Study Site will include 5 replication cohorts with >100,000 participants from diverse ancestry populations. Our main objective is to establish a Study Site for PRS Methods and Analysis for AA Populations and to collaboratively generate and refine PRS for other populations of diverse ancestry by integrating existing datasets with genomics and phenotype data for a range of complex diseases and traits. Our first aim is to integrate phenotype and genomic datasets from ~50,000 African individuals from seven individual cohort studies. Subsequently, we will evaluate PRSs and develop a novel method that takes into consideration, ancestry-specific genomic regions to improve prediction of PRSs in populations characterised by genetic sub-structure. Finally, we will develop an interactive dashboard for dissemination of PRS-related data from diverse ancestry populations. CARDINAL Study Site is ideal for generating novel biologic insights into complex disease etiology, with applications in global populations. Members of the CARDINAL team have successfully worked together for about a decade, generating and disseminating scientific knowledge through high impact publications. By establishing a Study Site in the Polygenic Risk Score Diversity Consortium, CARDINAL brings the largest cohort of African-ancestry participants to the table, to explore the genomics contribution to common CMDs and other NCDs. Narrative Cardiometabolic diseases are on the increase worldwide, contributing to high levels of morbidity and mortality, with limited resources among lower-resource populations in North America and Africa to prevent disease, make diagnosis and clinically manage patients. In this study we bring together ~50,000 African-ancestry participants (African American, Jamaicans and continental African) to form the CARDINAL study to assess and develop polygenic risk scores for cardiometabolic diseases and traits, and to develop analytic approaches for multi-ethnic cohorts leveraging the increased genetic diversity and lower linkage disequilibrium in African genomes. This research will lead to a better understanding of the transferability of polygenic risk scores from discovery to target populations of different ethnicities, informing prevention and diagnostic strategies that could contribute to the development of effective public health policies.",Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Methods and Analysis for Populations of Diverse Ancestry - Study Sites,10212798,U01HG011717,"['Admixture', 'Affect', 'Africa', 'African', 'African American', 'Algorithms', 'Alleles', 'American', 'Biological', 'Blood Pressure', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Cause of Death', 'Chronic Disease', 'Clinical Management', 'Cohort Studies', 'Communicable Diseases', 'Complex', 'Country', 'Creatine', 'Data', 'Data Collection', 'Data Set', 'Development', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic', 'Disease', 'Dyslipidemias', 'Environment', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Etiology', 'European', 'Funding', 'Gene Frequency', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic Segment', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Glucose', 'Guidelines', 'Health', 'Health Policy', 'Heart Diseases', 'Heredity', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Hypertension', 'Individual', 'Insulin', 'Jamaican', 'Joints', 'Kidney Diseases', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Life Style', 'Linkage Disequilibrium', 'Lipids', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'North America', 'Northern Africa', 'Obesity', 'Participant', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Persons', 'Phenotype', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Heterogeneity', 'Population Study', 'Prevention', 'Process', 'Protocols documentation', 'Public Health', 'Publications', 'Quality Control', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Scientist', 'Scoring Method', 'Signal Transduction', 'Site', 'Stroke', 'Structure', 'Target Populations', 'Translating', 'Trust', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'Variant', 'Work', 'base', 'burden of illness', 'cardiometabolism', 'clinical risk', 'cohort', 'dashboard', 'data harmonization', 'data integration', 'data standards', 'disorder risk', 'diverse data', 'genome wide association study', 'genomic data', 'genomic variation', 'health disparity', 'health inequalities', 'improved', 'insight', 'interactive tool', 'lifestyle data', 'machine learning method', 'member', 'mortality', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'polygenic risk score', 'population stratification', 'prevent', 'tool', 'trait', 'working group']",NHGRI,UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND BALTIMORE,U01,2021,958531
"Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats Project Summary (Overall)  The purpose of this renewal application is to continue the successful activities of our center, which uses quantitative genetic techniques to study the genetic basis of drug abuse-related behaviors in outbred rats. When our center was initially funded in June 2014, our goal was to develop outbred N/NIH heterogeneous stock (HS) rats as a platform for genetic studies of behaviors that were difficult or impossible to study in mice. The first four years of funding have allowed us to establish a vibrant community of investigators using HS rats to study drug abuse and other traits, which we refer to as an ecosystem. This ecosystem includes both the investigators who are directly involved in this renewal application and many others who have obtained separate funding, some from NIDA, and some from other sources. The growth of this ecosystem reflects one of the ways that our center has served as national resource. We are proposing three projects that involved phenotyping HS rats for a variety of traits, including intravenous cocaine and nicotine self-administration, response to novelty, social behavior, reaction time, and delay discounting. Two of those projects are continuations from the prior funding period and are designed to increase our sample size from 1,600 to 3,200 rats per phenotype. We present data showing that such an increase produces an exponential increase in the number of significant findings. This approach parallels human genetics studies of SUD, which have also benefited tremendously from larger sample sizes. We will use these data to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and a suite of related techniques. In addition, we will measure gene expression in behaviorally naïve rats using RNASeq and use those data to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We will then integrate GWAS and eQTL data in an effort to identify specific genes that influence the behavioral phenotypes. Many of the behavioral domains being studied are known to be sexually dimorphic; our study will use both male and female rats, which will allow us to identify sex differences and sex by genotype interactions. We will also study genetic correlations, perform phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS), transcriptome wide association studies (TWAS) and explore a novel strategy called polygenic transcriptomic risk scores (PTRS), that is intended to allow translation of polygenic signals across species. Project 4 will use a network-based approach to extend our GWAS to account for known biological networks. This proposed renewal also includes a pilot project core to support new directions and take advantage of unforeseen opportunities. Finally we propose an administrative core that supports many activities of the center, including educational, career development and public outreach. The results of these studies will enhance our understanding of the role of genes in a range of psychologically complex behaviors and will provide novel biological insights that may support future efforts at preventing or treating drug abuse. Project Narrative (Overall)  Using powerful genetic, molecular and statistical techniques, we will study the genetic basis of traits that have well-established relevance to drug abuse. We expect that these studies will enhance our understanding of drug abuse and lead to the identification of specific genes and pathways. These discoveries will improve our understanding of genetic susceptibility to drug abuse in humans and may identify new opportunities to treat psychiatric disorders including but not limited to addiction.",Center for Genetic Studies of Drug Abuse in Outbred Rats,10160842,P50DA037844,"['Adolescent', 'Animal Model', 'Attention', 'Behavior', 'Behavioral', 'Biological', 'Brain region', 'Breeding', 'Cancer Grant Supplements (P30)', 'Cessation of life', 'Cocaine', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Crime', 'Cues', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Development', 'Drug abuse', 'Ecosystem', 'Education', 'Esthesia', 'Female', 'Foundations', 'Funding', 'Future', 'Gene Expression', 'Generations', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Recombination', 'Genetic Techniques', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Growth', 'Healthcare', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Human Genetics', 'Human Genome', 'Impulsivity', 'Inbred Strains Rats', 'Individual', 'Intravenous', 'Knowledge', 'Lead', 'Maps', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Molecular', 'Mus', 'National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases', 'National Institute of Drug Abuse', 'Network-based', 'Nicotine', 'Pathway interactions', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Population', 'Productivity', 'Quantitative Genetics', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'Rattus', 'Reaction Time', 'Regulation', 'Relapse', 'Research Personnel', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Role', 'Sample Size', 'Self Administration', 'Sex Differences', 'Signal Transduction', 'Social Behavior', 'Social Reinforcement', 'Source', 'Statistical Methods', 'Substance Use Disorder', 'System', 'Techniques', 'Translations', 'United States National Institutes of Health', 'addiction', 'behavior influence', 'behavioral phenotyping', 'behavioral study', 'career development', 'cocaine self-administration', 'cocaine use', 'cost', 'deep learning', 'design', 'discounting', 'drug abuse related behavior', 'effective therapy', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic approach', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'improved', 'insight', 'male', 'nicotine use', 'novel', 'novel strategies', 'outreach', 'phenome', 'phenotypic data', 'premature', 'preservation', 'prevent', 'psychologic', 'response', 'sex', 'sexual dimorphism', 'success', 'sustained attention', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'virtual', 'web site']",NIDA,"UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO",P50,2021,3009655
"Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. To date, the exact neural and molecular mechanisms underlying tinnitus are not known. Tinnitus is associated with a number of otological diseases and clinical conditions; however, almost 50% of tinnitus cases are not attributable to any known cause (Stouffer & Tyler, 1990). There is likely a genetic component to tinnitus (Sand et al, 2007). A critical gap in the knowledge base is how to clinically identify those who are genetically predisposed to tinnitus well before they acquire this hearing health issue. The short-term goal of this R21 Early Career Research PAR 16-057 application, entitled “Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,” is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in young adults. The application is proposed by a team of researchers: The PI is Ishan Bhatt, Ph.D. in audiology (CCC-A, FAAA), who is working with Co-PI’s Jason Wilder, Ph.D. in genetics, Jin Wang, Ph.D. in statistics, and Raquel Dias, Ph.D. in Bioinformatics. This project will fill the gap in knowledge by identifying the critical variables associated with a genetic predisposition to CT. This investigation will include college-aged young participants to control for age- related confounding variables such as systemic diseases and hearing loss. According to the PI’s pilot study (Bhatt, 2017a), the estimated prevalence of chronic tinnitus (CT), acute tinnitus (AT) and no tinnitus (NT) is around 8%, 13% and 79%, respectively. To accomplish our short-term goal, we will conduct a case-control- control exonic genome-wide association study (GWAS) (N = 300) in which subjects will be divided into three groups: those with (1) CT (tinnitus for > 1 year; n=100), (2) AT (tinnitus for ≤ 1 year, presumably due to acute environmental exposure; n=100); and (3) NT (no experience of tinnitus in a lifetime; n=100). The Specific Aims are: (1) to identify associations between exonic Single Nucleotide Polymorhisms (SNPs) and tinnitus phenotype. Based on the criteria laid out in the preliminary studies (Bhatt, 2017a; Bhatt et al., 2016; Phillip et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that causal SNPs will exhibit a higher frequency of a specific genotype for subjects with CT compared to subjects with AT and NT. (2) To identify association between selected SNPs in a candidate set of genes and audiologic measures among subjects with CT, AT and NT, Based on our preliminary studies (Bhatt et al., 2016, Phillips et al., 2015), our working hypothesis is that subjects with causal alleles for CT will exhibit pathophysiological variation in the audiometric measures. Significance: Successful completion of this project will enable us to identify phenotypic and genotypic profiles of CT. This will help us to achieve our long term goal, which is to develop a genetic Risk Profile that can be used by health-care providers, and educators (e.g., health professionals, music and industrial arts teachers) to identify individuals genetically at risk for CT. Project Narrative Tinnitus, the phantom perception of sound in absence of an external sound source, is a prevalent hearing disorder. The short-term goal of this study is to identify detailed phenotypic and genotypic profiles of chronic tinnitus in college-aged young adults. The relevance of the project to public health is reflected in the long-term goal, which is to construct a genetic risk profile which can be used by health-care providers and educators to identify individuals genetically at risk for chronic tinnitus.",Tinnitus: Audiological measures and genetic susceptibility,10359459,R21DC016704,"['Acute', 'Address', 'Adolescent', 'Age', 'Aging', 'American', 'Anxiety', 'Audiology', 'Auditory Evoked Potentials', 'Auditory Perception', 'Bioinformatics', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Characteristics', 'Chronic', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Confounding Factors (Epidemiology)', 'Development', 'Disease', 'Doctor of Philosophy', 'Education', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Ethnic Origin', 'Exhibits', 'Exposure to', 'Family', 'Financial compensation', 'Frequencies', 'General Population', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Polymorphism', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Personnel', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professional', 'Hearing', 'Hearing problem', 'Human', 'Hyperacusis', 'Impaired cognition', 'Individual', 'Industrial Arts', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Mental Depression', 'Military Personnel', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Music', 'Noise', 'Nucleotides', 'Otitis Media', 'PTGS1 gene', 'PTGS2 gene', 'Participant', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Phase', 'Phenotype', 'Physiological', 'Pilot Projects', 'Policy Maker', 'Population', 'Predisposition', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention strategy', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Prostaglandin-Endoperoxide Synthase', 'Public Health', 'Quality of life', 'Regulation', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Serotonin', 'Silicon Dioxide', 'Sleeplessness', 'Smoking', 'Sodium', 'Source', 'Systemic disease', 'Testing', 'Tinnitus', 'United States Department of Veterans Affairs', 'Variant', 'Veterans', 'age related', 'aged', 'aging population', 'base', 'career', 'case control', 'causal variant', 'clinical development', 'college', 'experience', 'gene environment interaction', 'genetic association', 'genetic testing', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'hearing impairment', 'individualized medicine', 'innovation', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'learning strategy', 'novel', 'otoacoustic emission', 'relating to nervous system', 'serotonin receptor', 'serotonin transporter', 'sound', 'statistics', 'teacher', 'trait', 'treatment strategy', 'voltage gated channel', 'young adult']",NIDCD,UNIVERSITY OF IOWA,R21,2021,135331
"Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity Project Summary The long-term goal of this project is to establish a quantitative framework for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) care based on clinical, imaging, genetic, and informatics principles. In the previous grant period, we have developed artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis, but real-world adoption has been limited by lack of prospective validation and by perception of these systems as “black boxes” that do not explain their rationale for diagnosis. Furthermore, although biomedical research data are being generated at an enormous pace, much less work has been done to integrate disparate scientific findings across the spectrum from genomics to imaging to clinical medicine. This renewal will address current gaps in knowledge in these areas. Our overall hypotheses are that developing a quantitative framework for ROP care using artificial intelligence and analytics will improve clinical disease management, that building “explainable” artificial intelligence systems will enhance clinical acceptance and educational opportunities, and that analysis of relationships among clinical, imaging, environmental, and genetic findings, in ROP will improve understanding of disease pathogenesis and risk. These hypotheses will be tested using three Specific Aims: (1) Evaluation performance of an artificial intelligence system for ROP diagnosis and screening prospectively. This will include: (a) recruit a target of over 2000 eye exams including wide-angle retinal images from 375 subjects at 5 centers, (b) optimize an image quality detection algorithm we have recently developed, and (c) analyze system accuracy for ROP diagnosis and screening (using a novel quantitative vascular severity scale). (2) Improve the interpretability of our existing artificial intelligence methods for ROP diagnosis. This will include: (a) increase “explainability” of systems by combining deep learning with traditional feature extraction methods, (b) develop neural networks to identify changes between serial images, and (c) evaluate these methods through systematic feedback by experts. (3) Develop integrated models for ROP pathogenesis and risk. This will include: (a) build and improve ROP risk prediction models based on clinical, image, and demographic features, and (b) integrate genetic, imaging, clinical, and environmental variables through genetic risk prediction by machine learning, by investigating casual relationships with genetic variants and genetic risk scores, and by incorporating SNP associations with gene expression measurements to identify functional genes of ROP. Ultimately, these studies will significantly reduce barriers to adoption of technologies such as artificial intelligence for clinicians, and will demonstrate a prototype for health information management which combines genotypic and phenotypic data. This project will be performed by a multi-disciplinary team of investigators who have worked successfully together for nearly 10 years, and who have expertise in ophthalmology, biomedical informatics, computer science, computational biology, ophthalmic genetics, genetic analysis, and statistical genetics. Project Narrative ROP is a leading cause of childhood blindness in the US and throughout the world, and the number of infants at risk for disease is increasing as the rate of premature birth rises. Rapidly-progressive changes associated with retinal vascular development may be visualized by clinical examination, captured by wide-angle imaging, and analyzed genetically. This project will develop, enhance, and validate artificial intelligence and analytic tools to help clinicians identify infants at risk for severe ROP using image analysis, genetic analysis, and integrative informatics that combines these factors – while also providing insight about disease pathogenesis.",Clinical and genetic analysis of retinopathy of prematurity,10206145,R01HD107493,"['Address', 'Adoption', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Area', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biomedical Research', 'Blindness', 'Blood Vessels', 'Caring', 'Childhood', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Informatics', 'Clinical Medicine', 'Clinical Research', 'Cohort Studies', 'Computational Biology', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Environment', 'Evaluation', 'Expert Systems', 'Feedback', 'Funding', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Markers', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Grant', 'Health', 'Image', 'Image Analysis', 'Infant', 'Informatics', 'Information Management', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Machine Learning', 'Macular degeneration', 'Measurement', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Network-based', 'Ophthalmic examination and evaluation', 'Ophthalmology', 'Other Genetics', 'Paper', 'Pathogenesis', 'Peer Review', 'Perception', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Predisposition', 'Premature Birth', 'Premature Infant', 'Publishing', 'Reference Standards', 'Research', 'Research Personnel', 'Retina', 'Retinopathy of Prematurity', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Severities', 'System', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'United States', 'Validation', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'care delivery', 'clinical Diagnosis', 'clinical examination', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinical risk', 'clinically significant', 'computer science', 'data access', 'data integration', 'deep learning', 'detection platform', 'diagnosis standard', 'disorder risk', 'feature extraction', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic variant', 'high risk', 'imaging genetics', 'improved', 'insight', 'multidisciplinary', 'multiple data types', 'neovascular', 'neural network', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'prospective', 'prototype', 'real world application', 'recruit', 'retinal imaging', 'risk prediction', 'risk prediction model', 'screening', 'serial imaging', 'supplemental oxygen']",NICHD,OREGON HEALTH & SCIENCE UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,640901
"Deep learning for decoding genetic regulation and cellular maps in craniofacial development Project Summary A deep understanding of gene regulation and function during craniofacial development is not only important for our biological knowledge, but also critical to identify causal variants and genes underlying many dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases. Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and DOC diseases. These datasets are highly heterogeneous (e.g. platforms, species, tissues, developmental stages) and cross-species (e.g. human and mouse), requiring novel analytical approaches for decoding genetic regulation, molecular function, and cellular maps in craniofacial development. Critically, because of practical unavailability of human embryonic craniofacial tissue, there is a big gap between the abundant -omics and functional studies in murine craniofacial development and large-scale human genetic studies of DOC diseases. In this proposal, we combine machine learning, genomics, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), complex disease genetics, developmental biology to design novel methods aiming to decode complex genetic regulation and cellular maps during craniofacial development. We propose three specific aims. Aim 1. To develop a deep learning method, DeepFace, for characterizing and prioritizing genetic variants and regulation during craniofacial development. DeepFace is designed to decipher functional impact of noncoding variants and will be the first deep learning method to integrate cross-species functional features in craniofacial development. We will validate DeepFace by using data from genome-wide association studies (15 datasets) and case-parent trio-based whole genome sequencing (3 datasets) of orofacial clefts (OFCs). This validation will identify potential causal variants, both common and de novo mutations, in OFCs. Aim 2. To develop deep learning methods for time-series scRNA-seq data analysis in craniofacial development. We will develop novel algorithms including TTNNet for integrating time-series scRNA- seq data and DrivAER for tracing developmental trajectories and identifying driving transcription factors in craniofacial development. We will validate the methods using scRNA-seq datasets from the FaceBase consortium and to-be-generated data for mouse palate formation. Aim 3. To experimentally validate and characterize the top ranked novel mutations (Aim 1) and regulators (Aim 2). Building on our previous studies, strong preliminary data and highly experienced team, this proposal is timely to develop machine learning methods to effectively address the current gap between the genomics studies in murine craniofacial development and human genetic studies of orofacial clefts. The successful completion will provide 1) the NIDCR research community a suite of novel methods and analytical tools for genomic/epigenomic/scRNA-seq data, and 2) the mechanistic assessment on the mutations/genes and transcriptional regulators that are potentially involved in OFCs and related craniofacial diseases. Project Narrative Numerous -omics datasets at the genomic, epigenomic, (single-cell) transcriptomic levels have been generated for craniofacial development and dental, oral, and craniofacial (DOC) diseases; however, these data are highly heterogeneous, limiting the analysis for the understanding of DOC biology and discovery of causal mutations and regulators in DOC diseases.

"Deep-learning based profiling of patient-derived cells as a tool for genomic and translational medicine Project Summary/Abstract: The genetic landscape of rare and common diseases has emerged as heterogeneous and complex. Already, researchers and clinicians face the challenge to discern pathophysiological mechanism and treatment opportunities for hundreds of genetic subtypes that have been identified in rare diseases, such as inherited neuropathies (INs) or mitochondrial diseases (MiDs) alone. Still, a large fraction of disease loci remains to be discovered – a daunting task, since gene-identification studies often require immense sample-sizes, which are difficult to achieve, even for more common conditions. Simultaneously, much of the heritability of many disorders appears to be determined by the collective impact of possibly thousands of low-impact variants, spread across the genome. Ideally, the impact of a given set of candidate variants could be assessed within high-throughput framework that accounts for the genetic context of individual patients. Leveraging advanced deep learning algorithms, we have developed an unbiased, scalable method to rapidly identify disease- associated phenotypes in high-resolution, multiplexed, fluorescent microscopy images of primary, patient derived cells. In turn, the discovered phenotypes can be exploited as experimental signals against which the disease relevance of candidate variants can be confirmed, by virtue of genetic complementation experiments. At the same time, the standardized and scalable nature of our method renders it suitable to test potential therapeutic interventions, e.g. to test the efficacy of potential gene-therapy, or to screen small molecule libraries, while maintaining patient-specific granularity. The goal of this proposal is to apply our approach to an expanded cohort of patient cells and to refine methods to interpret both genetic and pharmacological perturbations. In this, I will be supported by an exceptional and multidisciplinary team of experts in clinical, molecular and functional genetics, and computer scientists, within the world-class scientific environment offered by Columbia University and the Broad Institute. In a carefully designed development plan, I will finalize my training in machine learning and data science, expand my expertise to single-cell RNA-sequencing and other single-cell methods, and acquire essential leadership and scholarly skills required for an independent research career. Over the course of this award, I will apply our cellular profiling approach to generate a standardized map of deep, quantitative descriptions of disease-associated cellular phenotypes across a number of INs, MiDs and neurodegenerative conditions. We will explore the integration of RNA-sequencing to enhance our approach. Finally, we will apply our method to the discovery and confirmation of new disease genes, and screen a limited number of pharmacological interventions through our method. Together, the proposed developmental plan and research strategy will foster my ability to lead an independent research program, to establish cellular profiling as a powerful platform to advance genomic and translational medicine. Project Narrative: The functional interpretation of genetic variation in diseases faces critical roadblocks, due to the lack of scalable methods to assess the significance of candidate variants experimentally, while accounting for genomic context. This proposal introduces a morphological profiling method, that is able to rapidly identify disease-associated phenotypes in patient cells and offers a cost-efficient and unbiased way to determine the significance of putative pathogenic variants at scale.

"Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction Project Summary Early disease prevention, detection, and intervention are fundamental goals for advancing human health. Meanwhile, genetic risk is, for all intents and purposes, the earliest significant contributor to common, heritable, disease risk. Thus, in theory, genetic profiling should be the ideal tool for early disease prevention. Yet, genetic factors are rarely used directly to predict future disease risk. Rather, genetic information is typically relegated to phenotype-first scenarios: providing or confirming diagnoses for individuals with overt disease or clarifying the genetic risk for individuals with a strong family history of disease. For modern genomics to make a significant impact on disease prevention the use of genomic information must transition to a genotype-first approach; prediction of genetic disease risk in otherwise healthy individuals. A major barrier to this transition includes our limited ability to predict the precise array of risks and likely phenotypic expression of disease in an individual from genetic and other risk factors. The degree of disease risk and phenotypic expression conveyed to any single individual by genetic factors is a result of a complex interplay between direct and indirect genetic effects, other unmodifiable risk factors (age, gender, ancestry, family history), and intermediate modifiable risk factors (environment, behavior, laboratory values, health status, therapy status, etc.) many of which have their own direct genetic mediators. New approaches are required to dissect this interplay in order to personalize and contextualize preventative actions that most effectively reduce overall disease risk. The overarching goal of this proposal is the development of innovative Deep learning and machine-learning approaches to integrate baseline genetic risk predictions with the measurement of traditional risk factors in order to provide more accurate and actionable predictions of disease risk. By tying genetic risk to traditional risk factors, especially modifiable risk factors, we will enable actionability by allowing both a determination of preventative actions that may be especially effective because they offset genetic risk, as well as the identification of modifiable risk factors that should be monitored and controlled proactively given increased genetic predisposition. To accomplish this goal, we propose to develop methods to: (1) infer the likely phenotypic expressivity of monogenic risk variants via a spatial covariance machine learning approach, (2) predict prevalent disease cases and the expected value of intermediate modifiable risk factors from polygenic and other unmodifiable risk factors, and finally (3) predict prevalent disease cases through interactions between baseline genetic expectations and observed (measured) intermediate modifiable risk factors in a deep learning framework. Adjusting age and modifiable risk factors in these trained models would then allow for the interactive projection of future disease risk and the identification of modifiable risk factors that, when manipulated, lead to the greatest change in future disease risk. We focus on the development of methods for coronary artery disease given its public health importance, the known utility of polygenic risk estimation, and the current evidence for polygene-by-environment interactions. In addition, the approach we propose integrates directly with current clinical decision support tools for coronary artery disease management. However, we will build a general framework that can be extended to any common heritable adult-onset condition, especially those with known heritable, traditional risk factors Project Narrative Significant investment has been placed in the identification of genetic risk factors for common diseases. Yet, outside of family history, genetic risk is almost never included in routine clinical risk assessments. The goal of this proposal is to develop deep learning methods for the integration of genetic and traditional risk factors into comprehensive disease risk prediction.",Genotype First: Actionable Genetic Risk through Genotype-to-Phenotype Prediction,10245285,R01HG010881,"['Adult', 'Age', 'Area', 'Behavior', 'Blood Pressure', 'Cholesterol', 'Clinical', 'Complex', 'Coronary Arteriosclerosis', 'Data', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnosis', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Disease Management', 'Elements', 'Environment', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Family', 'Family history of', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Diseases', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genome', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Health Status', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Incidence', 'Individual', 'Intervention', 'Investments', 'Knowledge', 'Label', 'Laboratories', 'Lead', 'Machine Learning', 'Measurement', 'Measures', 'Mediator of activation protein', 'Medical Genetics', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Modernization', 'Monitor', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus', 'Onset of illness', 'Output', 'Pathogenicity', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Recording of previous events', 'Risk', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Factors', 'Sample Size', 'Training', 'Variant', 'base', 'clinical decision support', 'clinical practice', 'clinical risk', 'data standards', 'deep learning', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder prevention', 'disorder risk', 'expectation', 'feature extraction', 'feedforward neural network', 'genetic information', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic profiling', 'genetic risk factor', 'genome-wide', 'genome-wide analysis', 'improved', 'innovation', 'learning strategy', 'method development', 'modifiable risk', 'multitask', 'novel strategies', 'personalized intervention', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'supervised learning', 'support tools', 'theories', 'tool', 'unsupervised learning', 'variant of unknown significance']",NHGRI,SCRIPPS RESEARCH INSTITUTE,R01,2021,761822
"Integrative approaches to identification and interpretation of genes underlying psychiatric disorders Psychiatric disorders contribute substantially to the disease burden in the United States and worldwide. There is strong evidence for a genetic contribution to many psychiatric illnesses. In recent years, with the advancement of high throughput genomic technologies and the availability of large samples, remarkable success has been made in risk gene discovery for major psychiatric disorders [e.g., schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)] through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, due to the high complexity of the human genome, few causal genes or variants have been identified within GWAS risk loci, thus, to date, limiting the potential of translating these genetic findings into biological mechanisms. There is now a great need to pinpoint causal genes/variants at the known GWAS risk loci and to understand their causal mechanisms, as well as to discover novel genes from novel risk loci. There is also growing evidence that risk variants from GWAS tend to be located in regulatory DNA regions in disease-relevant tissues or cell types, suggesting that risk variants may act through regulation of gene expression. Studies leveraging diverse functional genomic resources may benefit psychiatric risk gene discovery and result in better prediction of their biological relevance. This proposal aims to employ highly integrative approaches to identify causal genes and regulatory noncoding variants underlying SCZ, BD, and MDD. Our specific aims are: 1) Integrate GWAS with brain methylome for risk gene discovery, by leveraging a dense high-resolution reference panel of DNAm from whole genome bisulfite sequencing of DNA from three different brain regions (frontal cortex, hippocampus, and caudate) and an enlarged array-based reference panel; 2) Apply a deep learning approach to predicting disease-relevant regulatory variants, by employing features from disease-relevant gene regulatory networks and functional genomic annotations within brain tissues and neural cell types; and 3) Map prioritized genes and variants to specific brain cell types and brain function. We have assembled an outstanding multidisciplinary team with expertise in psychiatric genetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, and neuroimaging. Our goal is to apply multidisciplinary and cutting-edge analytical strategies to help address the challenges arising in the post-GWAS era. The identification and characterization of risk genes and noncoding regulatory variants would help improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms that underlie psychiatric illnesses, moving us closer to designing effective prevention and treatment for these disorders. Project Narrative: This proposal takes integrative approaches to prioritizing genes and noncoding variants underlying psychiatric disorders through better leveraging functional genomic resources to predict their biological relevance.

"Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids. PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The goal of the proposed research is to discover neurobiologically interpretable gene networks for addiction, specifically for cigarettes and opioids. To achieve this goal, we will apply a new multi-omics, multi-method framework—Gene Network Identification and Integration (GNetII)—to identify gene networks associated uniquely with cigarette or opioid outcomes and networks shared across these addictions. GNetII includes genome-wide epistasis, Explainable Artificial Intelligence, gene network construction, and Lines-of-Evidence methods. These cornerstone methods will enable integration of large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) data in living subjects, postmortem human brain data (RNA-sequencing, DNA methylation, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing, and variant genotypes) from addiction case and control decedents (deceased individuals), and public omics data. Cigarette smoking and opioid outcomes are genetically correlated, and we have parallel GWAS and multi-omics brain data available in two highly relevant tissues, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens, for both of these addictions. Cigarettes and opioids are leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in the United States. These addictions affect millions of U.S. adults and youths and are highly heritable (e.g., 54% and 71% for opioid addiction and nicotine dependence, respectively). GWAS analyses have identified 300+ loci at genome-wide significance for smoking. GWAS for opioids are farther behind in sample size, but genome-wide significant loci are emerging. Neurobiological effects of known loci are largely unknown, and more loci and connections among the loci are still to be discovered. We hypothesize that applying new big data science methods to large-scale GWAS and gene regulation data in brain tissue will reveal previously undetected relationships (such as epistatic interactions between genes) and add knowledge of the neurobiology underlying addiction. We propose the following specific aims:  Aim 1: Integrate multi-omics data to discover cigarette-associated gene networks.  Aim 2: Integrate multi-omics data to discover opioid-associated gene networks.  Aim 3: Integrate multi-omics data to find general addiction-associated gene networks. For cigarettes, Aims 1 and 3 will leverage GWAS (N=528,259) and multi-omics data in postmortem human brain from active smoker and nonsmoker decedents (N=262). For opioids, Aims 2 and 3 will use GWAS (N=49,178) and multi-omics brain data from opioid overdose case and control decedents (N=147). Analyses will be performed on Summit, the world's fastest supercomputer, which will greatly improve the likelihood of neurobiologically meaningful discoveries. Our study will capture complex networks across the genome to find previously unknown genes, as well as help explain the neurobiological underpinnings for the growing number of genetic loci associated with cigarette or opioid outcomes. PROJECT NARRATIVE Addictions to cigarettes and opioids are public health epidemics. The goal of this study is to identify gene networks that predispose individuals to these addictions. We will leverage cutting-edge methods (such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence), large-scale genome-wide association data in living subjects, and multiple omics data in postmortem human brain to further our understanding of the neurobiology underlying addiction.",Integrating Multiple Omics to Illuminate Gene Networks Underlying Cigarette Smoking and Opioids.,10267762,R01DA051913,"['Address', 'Affect', 'Algorithms', 'Artificial Intelligence', 'Attenuated', 'Autopsy', 'Biological Markers', 'Brain', 'Cessation of life', 'ChIP-seq', 'Cigarette', 'Complex', 'Cotinine', 'DNA Methylation', 'DNA methylation profiling', 'Data', 'Epidemic', 'Frequencies', 'Gene Expression Regulation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Epistasis', 'Genome', 'Genotype', 'Genotype-Tissue Expression Project', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Intelligence', 'International', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Maps', 'Methods', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Multiomic Data', 'Neurobiology', 'Nicotine Dependence', 'Nucleus Accumbens', 'Opiate Addiction', 'Opioid', 'Oranges', 'Outcome', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Public Health', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Sample Size', 'Signal Transduction', 'Smoker', 'Smoking', 'Systems Biology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissues', 'Toxicology', 'United States', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'addiction', 'base', 'big-data science', 'brain tissue', 'case control', 'cigarette addiction', 'cigarette smoking', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'insight', 'mortality', 'multiple omics', 'non-smoker', 'novel', 'opioid overdose', 'opioid use', 'random forest', 'smoking addiction', 'supercomputer', 'symposium', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'young adult']",NIDA,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R01,2021,588225
"Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD Abstract  This project seeks to further our understanding of the genetic influences on Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). One approach to increasing sample sizes for molecular genetic studies of MDD and thereby increasing power to detect genetic loci is to assess individuals using surveys that are shorter and more efficient than full clinical assessments. This `minimal phenotyping' leads to identification of risk loci that may not be specific to strictly defined MDD and can be associated with a variety of psychiatric phenotypes. While these discoveries are important to understand the overall biology of complex mental and psychiatric outcomes, they offer little direct and actionable insight into the biological underpinning of strictly defined MDD which shows increased severity, impairment, and recurrence risk and accounts for a disproportionate impact on disability and morbidity in comparison to liberally defined MDD. Recently, large biobanks surveying tens to hundreds of thousands of subjects across hundreds to thousands of variables and EHR records have been become available to the scientific community. Combining rich phenotype data with genome-wide genotyping or sequencing offers an unprecedented opportunity to leverage these resources to advance discovery and understanding of the genetic influences on MDD. One major challenge is the lack of uniform measures that allow assessment of strictly defined MDD, impairment, severity, and recurrence risk. This lack of `deep phenotyping' while pragmatic in allowing the assembly of large samples, creates challenges in accurate determinations of controls, non-specific mild cases, and strictly defined cases. We have previously shown how machine learning (ML) analysis methods can leverage this type of heterogeneous, broad, but light collection of information to predict and quantify risk in subjects not deeply assessed. While there is significant room for improvement in these predictions, the resulting effective sample size and power to detect specific liability loci increased dramatically when this method was applied. In Aim 1, we plan to evaluate 2 families of ML methods that can be used to predict unmeasured and specific strictly defined MDD risk. In Aim 2, we propose to use these predictions of risk in genetic association analyses to detect common genetic variation that influences risk specific to strictly defined MDD. Finally, we will make our biobank adapted ML method pipeline available to the broader psychiatric genetics research community which is expected to improve power and loci detection for other psychiatric disorders.   NARRATIVE  Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is common psychiatric disorder, a leading cause of disability worldwide, and partially influenced by genetics. Rigorous clinical assessments are generally needed for studies to distinguish between genetic loci influencing mild versus debilitating manifestations of the disorder. We propose to evaluate and adapt machine learning methods to estimate risk to strictly defined MDD in large-scale biobanks samples that measure many variables but may not contain rigorous clinical assessments and use these predictions to discover additional genetic variation specifically influencing MDD.",Adapting machine learning methods to detect genetic loci specific to strictly defined MDD,10196078,R21MH126358,"['Address', 'Biological', 'Biology', 'Body mass index', 'Characteristics', 'Clinical', 'Clinical assessments', 'Collection', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Disease', 'Family', 'Foundations', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Research', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genetic study', 'Genotype', 'Heritability', 'Impairment', 'Individual', 'Lead', 'Light', 'Machine Learning', 'Major Depressive Disorder', 'Measures', 'Mental disorders', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular Genetics', 'Morbidity - disease rate', 'Neurotic Disorders', 'Nucleotides', 'Outcome', 'Pattern', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Pilot Projects', 'Probability', 'Process', 'Psyche structure', 'Records', 'Recurrence', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Estimate', 'Sample Size', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Smoking Behavior', 'Solid', 'Structure', 'Surveys', 'Techniques', 'Training', 'Variant', 'Weight', 'biobank', 'disability', 'disorder risk', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic association', 'genome wide association study', 'genome-wide', 'genomic locus', 'improved', 'indexing', 'insight', 'interest', 'large datasets', 'lifetime risk', 'machine learning method', 'novel', 'phenotypic data', 'psychogenetics', 'risk prediction', 'risk variant', 'sample collection', 'statistical and machine learning', 'supervised learning', 'theories', 'trait', 'vector']",NIMH,RESEARCH TRIANGLE INSTITUTE,R21,2021,208389
"Deep Learning Based Genetic Risk Prediction for Type 1 Diabetes Project Summary Type I diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease of childhood caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In a subset of individuals with a genetic predisposition to T1D, environmental triggers instigate an autoimmune response which targets and damages pancreatic islets, leading to pre-diabetes and ultimately diabetes. A critical barrier in T1D prevention research is to identify and directly enroll children with a strong genetic predisposition for developing T1D into prevention trials. A robust genetic risk score (GRS) would allow for the identification of children at high-risk of T1D, their recruitment into T1D prevention trials, and subsequent testing of novel interventions. I aim to 1) optimize a multi-layer feedforward neural network genetic risk predictor that can be used to enroll newborns directly into T1D prevention trials; and 2) identify putative, novel T1D-causing SNPs, and their interactions. Completion of aim 1 would provide a better GRS to the T1D research community, which can be used to identify children with higher genetic risk of T1D development, increasing the statistical power of future T1D prevention clinical trials. Completion of aim 2 will provide a deeper biological understanding of the molecular drivers of T1D development, and potential new therapeutic targets for T1D prevention trials. Successful completion of this project will both help understand the genetic causes of type 1 diabetes and help prevent the disease.

"Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies The promise of precision medicine is to edit a patient’s DNA and/or administer therapeutics targeting etiologic molecules that prevent or reverse the disease process using a tailored design. All of this happens at the level of the individual and requires precision knowledge of that patient’s biology. In stark contrast, much of the knowledge we possess about genomic risk factors comes from statistical measures of association from human populations. The conceptual and practical disconnect between the populations we study and the individuals we want to treat is a major source of confusion about how to move forward in an era driven by genome technology. The primary goal of this proposal is to develop novel informatics methodology and software to facilitate precision medicine by connecting population and individual genomic phenomena. We propose here a Virtual Genomic Medicine (VGMed) workbench where clinicians can carry out thought experiments about the treatment of individual patients using models of disease risk derived from population-level studies. This will be accomplished by first developing a novel Genomics-guided Automated Machine Learning (GAML) algorithm for deriving risk models from real data that is accessible to clinicians (AIM 1). We will then develop a novel simulation approach that is able to generate artificial data that preserves the distribution of genetic effects observed in the real data while maintaining other characteristics such as genotype frequencies (AIM 2). This will generate open data allowing anyone to perform virtual interventions on patients derived from a population- level risk distribution. The workbench will allow editing of individual genotypes and simulate the administration of drugs by editing machine learning parameters in the simulation model (AIM 3). The change in risk and disease status for the specific patient will be tracked in real time. Finally, we provide a feature in the workbench that will allow the clinician to generate specific hypotheses about individual genetic variants that can then be validated using integrated knowledge sources that include databases such as PubMed and ClinVar thus giving the user immediate feedback (AIM 4). All methods and software will be provided as open-source (AIM 5). Most genetic studies of common human diseases result in statistical summaries of risk derived from human populations. These statistical summaries are not that helpful for determining the health of an individual. This proposal will create new computer algorithms and software help clinicians and researchers connect population- level statistics with individual level genetic effects to advance our understanding of how to treat patients based on their own unique genetic makeup.",Bioinformatics Strategies for Genome Wide Association Studies,10126058,R01LM010098,"['Algorithmic Software', 'Algorithms', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biology', 'Characteristics', 'ClinVar', 'Community Medicine', 'Computational algorithm', 'Computer software', 'Confusion', 'DNA', 'Data', 'Databases', 'Disease', 'Disease model', 'Etiology', 'Feedback', 'Frequencies', 'Genetic', 'Genetic study', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Goals', 'Health', 'Human', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Information Resources', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Measures', 'Methodology', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Online Systems', 'Patients', 'Pattern', 'Pharmaceutical Preparations', 'Population', 'Population Analysis', 'Population Study', 'Process', 'PubMed', 'Pythons', 'Research Personnel', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Source', 'Technology', 'Time', 'Validation', 'base', 'data preservation', 'design', 'disorder risk', 'experimental study', 'genetic makeup', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'individual patient', 'machine learning algorithm', 'models and simulation', 'novel', 'open data', 'open source', 'phenotypic data', 'precision medicine', 'prevent', 'simulation', 'statistics', 'therapeutic target', 'virtual', 'virtual intervention']",NLM,UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA,R01,2021,369515
"Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in discovery of genetic variants and genes associated with risk for psychiatric disorders. Altered gene expression in the brain, particularly at the cell-type-specific level, is believed to be a driving factor in conferring risk through these genetic variants. To link altered transcription to psychopathology, an immense amount of transcriptomic data is being accumulated, including single-cell and tissue level transcriptomes. Some of these samples cover critical developmental periods. An outstanding challenge is how to integrate single cell and tissue level transcriptomic data and how genetic variation alters transcription in specific cells to produce psychopathology. In this high dimensional ‘omics setting, we need powerful statistical and machine learning tools to produce integrative analyses and mesh those results with large psychiatric genetic datasets to achieve new insights. We propose to use our expertise in high dimensional statistical inference to tackle this challenge. We go beyond machine learning models that specialize in prediction, focusing instead on providing interpretable statistical inferences. We identify gene communities, defined in terms of cell type and spatiotemporal window, driving risk. With vast amounts of data comes great risk of spurious inferences based on non-rigorous analyses. On the other hand, reliable, but naïve tools can sacrifice power by not fully integrating all available information. Our overall objective to produce analytic tools that yield reliable and powerful inferences relating cell-type-specific gene expression with genetic risk factors. With these analytical tools made available to the research community, our longer-term goal is to hasten discoveries in the field and thus build the foundation from which therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders emerge. Our objectives will be accomplished with the following Specific aims: 1) statistically rigorous methods to select cell-type markers and to estimate cell-type-specific (CTS) expression, which will facilitate downstream analyses, including CTS eQTLs from tissue; 2) modeling dynamic gene communities throughout development of cell lineages or tissue and relating them to community-based-score statistics to gain insight into the impact of genetic risk factors on psychiatric disorders; and 3) novel methods for estimating gene co-expression networks from single cell RNA-seq. This contribution is significant because it will make many transcriptomic resources more valuable and enable downstream analyses, such as detection of CTS eQTLs in larger sample sets with higher power. Dynamic network analysis tools enhance our ability to identify gene communities that vary over developmental epochs and this variation facilitates inferences that relate cell type and developmental period with risk factors. The research proposed is innovative, in our opinion, because it uses novel statistical methods for integrative analysis of data from multiple sources, and cutting edge results to represent high dimensional data in a meaningful way that lends itself to clustering and network analysis. The statistical tools and results arising from the proposed research are relevant to public health because they will generate a deeper understanding of the etiology of psychiatric disorders. Moreover, the refined methods and new results provided by our research will be directly useful for the research community as they hunt for ways to prevent or treat mental disorders.",Computational Methods to Integrate and Interpret the Transcriptome from Single Cell and Tissue Level Data,10144504,R01MH123184,"['Algorithms', 'Automobile Driving', 'Brain', 'Brain region', 'Cell Lineage', 'Cell physiology', 'Cells', 'Cluster Analysis', 'Communities', 'Complex', 'Computing Methodologies', 'Data', 'Data Analyses', 'Data Set', 'Data Sources', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Dimensions', 'Disease', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Foundations', 'Gene Cluster', 'Gene Expression', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Predisposition to Disease', 'Genetic Risk', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Goals', 'Graph', 'Heritability', 'Heterogeneity', 'Human', 'Link', 'Literature', 'Machine Learning', 'Mental disorders', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Neurons', 'Noise', 'Organ', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pattern', 'Phenotype', 'Procedures', 'Psychopathology', 'Public Health', 'Publishing', 'Quantitative Trait Loci', 'RNA', 'Regulator Genes', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Risk', 'Risk Factors', 'Sampling', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Synapses', 'System', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Tissue Sample', 'Tissues', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Variant', 'Vertebral column', 'Work', 'analytical tool', 'base', 'brain cell', 'case control', 'cell type', 'critical developmental period', 'gene discovery', 'genetic analysis', 'genetic predictors', 'genetic risk factor', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'improved', 'innovation', 'insight', 'machine learning method', 'multidimensional data', 'multiple data sources', 'novel', 'prevent', 'psychogenetics', 'single-cell RNA sequencing', 'spatiotemporal', 'statistical and machine learning', 'statistics', 'stem', 'therapeutic target', 'tool', 'trait', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NIMH,CARNEGIE-MELLON UNIVERSITY,R01,2021,505168
"Advancing Multi-Omics and Electronic Health Records Computational Methodologies PROJECT SUMMARY  Phenomic advances from large-scale electronic health records (EHR) linked to DNA biobanks have pioneered an efficient approach to genetic discovery that has transformed human genetic studies, with the enormous potential to provide constraints on relevant biological mechanisms on a wide spectrum of human phenotypes. Nevertheless, our understanding of the downstream molecular consequences of genetic associations remains limited and impedes our ability to develop novel therapeutic strategies for complex diseases. Given their enormous discovery potential for human genomics and precision medicine, genetic analyses in diverse populations offer unprecedented opportunities to identify causal genetic mechanisms underlying human trait variation.  This research proposal aims to address these convergent developments and critical gaps and to exert a powerful influence on efforts to expand our understanding of disease mechanisms and therapeutic possibilities. Here we hypothesize that a comprehensive multi- omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology will provide a robust and rigorous framework. This proposal thus has the following aims: AIM 1: Develop a regularized regression based methodology and a deep learning framework to improve characterization of the genetic architecture of gene expression and to build robust prediction models, extending a Transcriptome-Wide Association Study (TWAS) methodology (called PrediXcan) that we developed. AIM 2: Develop statistical causal modeling of trait-associated genetic variation through a convergent TWAS and Mendelian Randomization approach and apply it to thousands of human traits with available GWAS and EHR data. AIM 3: Develop analytic approaches and software tools to further genetic analyses in admixed and multi-ethnic populations and to lay the groundwork for trans-ethnic multi-omic methodologies, using EHR data (e.g., BioVU, UK Biobank, All of Us). PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE We will develop a comprehensive multi-omic, phenomic, and trans-ethnic computational methodology that bridges the gap between Genetic Epidemiology and Functional Genomics.

"Trio Analysis of Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Integrated Bioinformatics Genomics Study (TRIOS) PROJECT SUMMARY Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) affects up to 5% of couples, yet nearly half of cases remain unexplained by current testing recommendations. Euploid pregnancy loss, in the setting of unexplained RPL, is particularly frustrating for patients and providers because there is no clear explanation or any proven therapies to mitigate risk of subsequent miscarriages. As clinical presentation and subsequent pregnancy outcomes vary widely, this complex disorder will ultimately require a precision health approach. While more than 3000 human genes are conserved and likely essential for early development, remarkably little is known about their contribution to RPL and current genetic databases are essentially devoid of RPL entries. Moreover, there is currently no database that annotates phenotypes and genotypes of these essential genes. This proposal aims to define genetic determinants of RPL through clinical and molecular phenotyping and genomic sequencing of a large RPL cohort, combined with novel bioinformatics and machine learning approaches to derive predictive risk algorithms. A comprehensive approach to identify genomic markers of pregnancy loss by whole genome sequencing of well- characterized RPL trios (mother-father-pregnancy loss) will be undertaken in Aim 1. These genetics efforts will be paired in Aim 2 with metabolomic, lipidomic and single cell transcriptomic profiling preconception and in early pregnancy. Leveraged with innovative machine learning strategies in Aim 3, this approach will significantly advance understanding of the genetic underpinnings of unexplained RPL. A clinical ‘intolerome’ database will be constructed in Aim 4 to facilitate worldwide collaboration and curation of genotypes and associated phenotypes, making the genetics and omics data and results available to the public as well as other funded teams. This multidisciplinary team includes leaders in RPL, genetics, genomics, prenatal diagnosis, bioinformatics and machine learning at Stanford, UCSF and OHSU. Combined we have a substantial cohort of RPL patients that will serve as a robust recruitment source, along with a collaboration with the unique UK Pregnancy Baby BioBank of existing trios to accomplish project goals. The proposed study is anticipated to have significant clinical and research impact by identifying the genomic contribution to RPL in a large and well phenotyped cohort and building improved risk predictions based on machine learning incorporating clinical, genetic, and molecular data. This work will lay the foundation for precision medicine-based interventions for RPL couples who are difficult to diagnose and have few proven treatments.

"Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype PROJECT SUMMARY Exome and whole-genome sequencing are becoming increasingly routine approaches in cancer[1], common disease[2]and rare disease diagnosis.[3] Despite their success, our ability to fully interpret the clinical relevance of personal genome variation remains a significant gap[4-6]. Considering this, the most crucial need is more genotype-phenotype data that link genetic variation with disease causation. The objective of this proposal is to improve the clinical interpretation of genetic variation; in particular, by developing integrative approaches that predict the effect of genetic variation on clinical phenotype. This proposal addresses the hypothesis, supported by preliminary data, that combining patient transcriptomic data with genotypic and clinical data (as opposed to each alone) offers a better mechanistic understanding of disease natural history, from initial presentation to progression. The specific aims are designed such that each independently add substantial functional genomic information, over and above previously available patient genetic data, to further resolve the clinical phenotype. Aim 1 establishes a comprehensive and widely-shared dataset of patient transcriptomic (and genetic) variation across multiple cancer, cardiovascular and thrombosis/bleeding phenotypes, in patients with somatically-acquired myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) and select other rare heritable blood diseases (HBD). Aim 2 methodically determines differential RNA expression and processing between clinically-relevant subgroups of MPN and HBD patients. Aim 3 brings these elements together – and applies two integrative Bayesian and machine learning approaches, RIVER[24] (RNA-informed variant effect on regulation) and LASSO[25] (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator), to resolve the functional and clinical relevance of rare variants; and identify signatures most predictive of disease risk or progression. Completion of these aims will contribute new scientific knowledge on how integrating transcriptomic data improves clinical genomic analyses in other genetic (and rare) diseases. In addition, this project will enable the Principal Investigator to develop expertise in the informatics and data science aspects of genomic medicine that complement her current background in biophysics, biochemistry and translational hematology. Combined with additional informatics training at Stanford University through coursework, seminars, one-on-one advising from project mentors, and interactions with the wider statistics, bioinformatics and genomics communities, this project will prepare the Principal Investigator to launch an independent academic career in genomic medicine. PROJECT NARRATIVE Accurate clinical interpretation of genetic variation in personal genome data is an essential component of personalized medicine approaches and the precise genetic diagnosis toward achieving improved public health. This project will integrate genetic and clinical modifiers with functional genomic information (RNA sequencing) from adequately-powered, disease-relevant cells; and provide direct insight into transcriptional perturbations caused by genetic variation.",Integrated Clinical and Transcriptomic Profiling to Characterize Disease Phenotype,10192782,K08HG010061,"['Address', 'Adult', 'Age Factors', 'Alleles', 'Alternative Splicing', 'Bayesian Modeling', 'Bayesian learning', 'Biochemistry', 'Bioinformatics', 'Biological Markers', 'Biophysics', 'Blood', 'Blood Cells', 'Blood Platelets', 'Blood specimen', 'Body mass index', 'Cardiovascular system', 'Cells', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Communities', 'Complement', 'DNA Sequence', 'Data', 'Data Science', 'Data Set', 'Databases', 'Demographic Factors', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Disease stratification', 'Elements', 'Etiology', 'Evaluation', 'Foundations', 'Functional disorder', 'Future', 'Gender', 'Gene Expression', 'Gene Expression Profiling', 'Gene Fusion', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Genetic Transcription', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genome', 'Genomic medicine', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Hematological Disease', 'Hematology', 'Hemorrhage', 'Heritability', 'Informatics', 'Investigation', 'Knowledge', 'Laboratories', 'Lasso', 'Lead', 'Link', 'Malignant Neoplasms', 'Medical Genetics', 'Mentors', 'Mentorship', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Myeloproliferative disease', 'Other Genetics', 'Outcome', 'Patients', 'Performance', 'Phenotype', 'Principal Investigator', 'Process', 'Protein Isoforms', 'Public Health', 'RNA', 'RNA Processing', 'Rare Diseases', 'Reference Standards', 'Regulation', 'Research Training', 'Resources', 'Rivers', 'Sampling', 'Severities', 'Subgroup', 'System', 'Thrombosis', 'Tissue-Specific Gene Expression', 'Training', 'Universities', 'Untranslated RNA', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Whole Blood', 'base', 'biobank', 'career', 'clinical phenotype', 'clinically relevant', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'design', 'disease diagnosis', 'disease natural history', 'disease phenotype', 'disorder risk', 'driver mutation', 'exome', 'experience', 'functional genomics', 'genetic disorder diagnosis', 'genetic variant', 'genome sequencing', 'genomic data', 'improved', 'informatics training', 'insight', 'knowledge base', 'multidisciplinary', 'novel', 'patient stratification', 'personalized medicine', 'phenotypic data', 'prediction algorithm', 'prospective', 'rare cancer', 'rare variant', 'regression algorithm', 'statistics', 'success', 'transcriptome', 'transcriptome sequencing', 'transcriptomics', 'variant of unknown significance', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY,K08,2021,190941
"Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits Project Summary  Over the past decade, data generated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been used to analyze heritability of human diseases and complex traits to improve understanding of genetic architecture, including identifying the genetic variants associated with diseases and their effect sizes. These heritability enrichment analyses have revealed underlying biological mechanisms such as regulatory elements involved in disease pathways. This research proposes statistical methods and analysis to formally assess the contribution of biological pathways, gene networks, and re-prioritized functional annotations to the genetic architecture of 94 human diseases and complex traits. Better understanding of disease architecture will improve genome-wide associations and fine mapping and provides robust inference of disease etiology and mechanisms.  The first aim is to determine the contribution of disease-associated gene pathways to disease heritability. It is well known that an abnormality in individual genes rarely causes a human disease. Large-scale pathway analysis will elucidate disease pathways by constructing functional annotations and applying an existing polygenic method to partition heritability. Furthermore, pathway analyses on candidate genes identified via whole-exome sequencing (WES) data will inform new biological inference. The resulting set of enriched pathway-trait pairs will further help with independent validation of previously reported associations and for novel associations enriched for trait heritability.  The second aim is to determine the contribution of gene network to disease heritability across 94 diseases, focusing on hub genes defined by a broad set of network connectivity metrics. The contribution of gene network to disease heritability has been only partially answered, limited to few network connectivity metrics across 42 diseases. Comprehensive analysis of gene sets informed by published gene networks will inform a new direction of integrating gene networks to infer biological mechanisms of human diseases. In addition, visualization method for large-scale gene networks will greatly enhance research translation, serving as a useful resource for studying gene-gene interactions for potential drugs and therapeutic targets.  The third aim is to de-noise and re-prioritize Mendelian annotations to infer candidate genes. Despite considerable process on prioritizing rare variants impacting Mendelian diseases, little is known about the utility of these Mendelian pathogenicity scores for common disease. I will conduct heritability enrichment analyses to answer informativeness of Mendelian disease pathogenicity scores for common disease. To further improve their informativeness, I propose a machine learning variant reprioritization framework. Ultimately, this project will produce (1) a detailed understanding of disease-associated biological pathways to disease heritability, (2) a set of functional annotations informed by gene networks significantly enriched for disease heritability, and (3) a new method to prioritize variants and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genomic features. Project Narrative Understanding human genetic variations, from single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to mutations, offers a great potential in uncovering underlying disease mechanisms by identifying new disease-associated genes and in discovering potential drug targets and therapeutics. This proposed studies aim to understand the role of these genetic variations in trait heritability, leveraging disease-associated biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations. The developed method to prioritize variants and genes will answer the contribution of gene pathways, gene sets informed by gene networks, and Mendelian pathogenicity scores to disease heritability.","Leveraging biological pathways, gene networks, and functional annotations to understand the genetic architecture of diseases and complex traits",10126720,F31HG010818,"['Architecture', 'Biological', 'Biological Process', 'Candidate Disease Gene', 'Code', 'Complex', 'Computer software', 'Data', 'Decision Trees', 'Disease', 'Disease Pathway', 'Drug Targeting', 'Etiology', 'Genes', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Goals', 'Heritability', 'Human Genetics', 'Individual', 'Link', 'Machine Learning', 'Mendelian disorder', 'Methods', 'Mutation', 'Pathogenicity', 'Pathway Analysis', 'Pathway interactions', 'Process', 'Property', 'Publishing', 'Regulatory Element', 'Reporting', 'Research', 'Resources', 'Role', 'Sampling', 'Signal Transduction', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism', 'Statistical Data Interpretation', 'Statistical Methods', 'Tissues', 'Training', 'Translational Research', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'Visualization', 'base', 'denoising', 'disorder risk', 'exome sequencing', 'fitness', 'gene interaction', 'genetic architecture', 'genetic variant', 'genome wide association study', 'human disease', 'improved', 'insight', 'novel', 'open source', 'protein protein interaction', 'rare variant', 'risk prediction', 'supervised learning', 'targeted treatment', 'therapeutic target', 'trait', 'user-friendly', 'whole genome']",NHGRI,MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY,F31,2021,46036
"Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease ABSTRACT Rapid progress in biomedical informatics has generated massive high-dimensional data sets (“big data”), ranging from clinical information and medical imaging to genomic sequence data. The scale and complexity of these data sets hold great promise, yet present substantial challenges. To fully exploit the potential informativeness of big data, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to integrate diverse data from different levels of informatics technologies. Existing approaches and methods for data integration to date have several important limitations. In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets. To increase power for association analysis compared to existing methods, we propose a novel multi-phenotype multi-variant association method that can evaluate the cumulative effect of common and rare variants in genes or regions of interest, incorporate prior biological knowledge on the multiple phenotype structure, identify associated phenotypes among multiple phenotypes, and be computationally efficient for high-dimensional phenotypes. To improve the prediction of clinical outcomes, we propose a novel machine learning strategy that can integrate multimodal neuroimaging and multi-omics data into a mathematical model and can incorporate prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes. The ongoing Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) projects as a test bed provide a unique opportunity to evaluate/validate the proposed methods. Specific Aims: Aim 1: to develop powerful statistical methods for multivariate tests of associations between multiple phenotypes and a single genetic variant or set of variants (common and rare) in regions of interest, and to develop methods for mediation analysis to integrate neuroimaging, genetic, and clinical data to test for direct and indirect genetic effects mediated through neuroimaging phenotypes on clinical outcomes; Aim 2: to develop a novel multivariate model that combines multi-omics and neuroimaging data using a machine learning strategy to predict individuals with disease or those at high-risk for developing disease, and to develop a novel multivariate model incorporating prior biological knowledge to identify genomic interactions associated with clinical outcomes; Aim 3: to evaluate and validate the proposed methods using real data from the ADNI and IMAS cohorts; and Aim 4: to disseminate and support publicly available user-friendly software that efficiently implements the proposed methods. RELEVANCE TO PUBLIC HEALTH: Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an exemplar is an increasingly common progressive neurodegenerative condition with no validated disease modifying treatment. The proposed multivariate methods are likely to help identify novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for AD. Identifying new susceptibility loci/biomarkers for AD has important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD. NARRATIVE In this project, we propose novel statistical methods and strategies to integrate high-dimensional neuroimaging, multi-omics, and clinical/behavioral data sets, which aim to increase detection power for association analysis and improve the prediction of clinical outcomes. The development of an advanced integrative analysis platform will provide more comprehensive and integrated approaches to answering complex biological questions. The proposed multivariate analysis methods have a high potential impact on and important implications for gaining greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying complex diseases, as well as helping the development of earlier diagnostic tests and novel therapeutic targets.","Integrating Neuroimaging, Multi-omics, and Clinical Data in Complex Disease",10139101,R01LM012535,"['Address', 'Advanced Development', 'Aging', 'Alzheimer&apos', 's Disease', 'Alzheimer’s disease biomarker', 'Beds', 'Behavioral', 'Big Data', 'Biological', 'Brain', 'Clinical', 'Clinical Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Complex', 'Data', 'Data Set', 'Detection', 'Development', 'Diagnostic tests', 'Discipline', 'Disease', 'Disease Progression', 'Evaluation', 'Genes', 'Genetic', 'Genetic Variation', 'Genomics', 'Genotype', 'Health', 'Heterogeneity', 'Indiana', 'Individual', 'Informatics', 'Knowledge', 'Machine Learning', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Mediating', 'Mediation', 'Medical Imaging', 'Memory', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Methods', 'Modeling', 'Molecular', 'Multiomic Data', 'Multivariate Analysis', 'Nerve Degeneration', 'Neurodegenerative Disorders', 'Outcome', 'Phenotype', 'Positron-Emission Tomography', 'Proteomics', 'Public Health', 'Science', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structure', 'Susceptibility Gene', 'Technology', 'Testing', 'Time', 'Validation', 'Variant', 'base', 'biomedical informatics', 'cohort', 'data integration', 'diagnostic biomarker', 'disease classification', 'diverse data', 'endophenotype', 'epigenomics', 'genetic association', 'genetic variant', 'high dimensionality', 'high risk', 'improved', 'insight', 'interest', 'learning strategy', 'mathematical model', 'metabolomics', 'multidimensional data', 'multimodality', 'multiple omics', 'neuroimaging', 'new therapeutic target', 'novel', 'novel diagnostics', 'predict clinical outcome', 'rare variant', 'risk variant', 'therapeutic target', 'transcriptomics', 'user friendly software']",NLM,INDIANA UNIV-PURDUE UNIV AT INDIANAPOLIS,R01,2021,341300
